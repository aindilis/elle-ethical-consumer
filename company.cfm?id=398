                        <p>• British Airways has set the ambitious goal to send zero waste to landfills in the United Kingdom. THe airway already recycles 30% of its waste at its main hubs in Heathrow and London Gaitwick. According to the 2007/08 Environmental Report, British Airways reduced the amount of waste from Heathrow and London Gaitwick directed to landfills by 10%. To reach the goal of zero waste to landfills, British Airways will attempt to recycle 50% of all waste that accumulates at Heathrow and Gaitwick. A percentage of the waste will be burned and the heat captured for energy. The latter process has been heavily criticized by environmental groups. </p>

                        <p>• In April 2009, British Airways teamed with Air France-KLM, Virgin Atlantic, two airline groups and the United Kingdom’s main airport operator to form the Aviation Global Deal Group.  The coalition pitched a carbon dioxide cap and trade system for the aviation industry to world leaders that were meeting in Bonn for U.N. climate change talks.  Aviation emissions are currently not regulated under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change or the Kyoto Protocol, but a new round of negotiations in Copenhagen at the end of 2009 could include a cap and trade system similar to the one proposed by the group of airlines.  The AGDG’s proposal represents a departure from the norm for the airline industry, which has previously spoken out against emissions reduction requirements. </p>

                        <p>• British Airways is a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global group of airlines and airports.  The IATA has staunchly opposed plans for a carbon emissions trading system in the European Union that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of global climate change.  The organization has argued that such a scheme would be prohibitively expensive for the airlines and make it more difficult to retain profits.  However, British Airways has spoken in support of a carbon cap and trade system for the airline industry. </p>

                        <p>• In January 2009, British Airways committed to reducing its carbon dioxide emissions to half of its 2005 levels by 2050, from 16 million to 8 million tons annually.  BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh said that the cuts will be achieved through investment in more efficient aircraft, use of alternative fuels, and an emissions trading scheme.  Critics point out that the announcement comes after BA strongly lobbied in support of the construction of a new runway at London’s Heathrow airport, which would allow 220,000 additional flights annually and increase the airport’s overall carbon emissions by 2.6 million tons annually. </p>

Walsh allegedly sent out e-mails to tens of thousands of customers asking them to support the new runway.  In the messages, he claimed that the runway would actually reduce carbon emissions and implied that the statement was endorsed by the British government.  However, the Department for Transport’s report on the runway found that it would increase overall emissions by 2.6 million tons annually. </p>

                        <p>• In order to make up for its $595 million dollar loss British Airways has asked its 40,000 employees to essentially work for free. About 6,000 workers have agreed to some sort of cost-saving measure, either taking unpaid leave, salary cuts, cutting back to part-time hours or agreeing to work for free for up to a month. </p>

One year later, five other airlines, including Air France-KLM and Cathay Pacific, were fined a total of $504 million by the Justice Department for similar offenses. </p>

                        <p>• A report released in 2007 by the Association of European Airlines found that British Airways lost more luggage than any other major European airline in 2006.  The AEA data showed that British Airways lost 23 bags for every 1,000 passengers over the course of that year.  This is seven bags higher than the average of 15.7 bags for the 23 other airlines surveyed.  A spokesperson for British Airways apologized for their record, stating that the airline would strive to reduce its number of bags lost. </p>

                        <p>• In 2006, British Airways put two of its executives on leave of absence in response to the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation into the airline for price fixing.  The company’s commercial director and its head of communication were both allegedly instrumental in reaching out to other airlines regarding fixing prices on international passenger fuel surcharge rates.  The investigation culminated in a $300 million fine in 2007. </p>

                        <p>A labor dispute was settled in 2011 between British Airways executives and Unite labor union after the union organized 22 strike days due to unfavorable pay freezes and restructuring of cabin procedures. The union’s strike cost the airline $240 million. British Airways reprimanded the striking workers by taking away travel concessions. The two parties were able to reach an agreement with workers agreeing to the new cabin procedures in return for pay increases. </p>

                        <p>British Airways has had a rocky history with its employees. Several unofficial strikes have taken place over the past 10 years in response to unfavorable policies such as the firing of catering staff and pension deficits. British Airways executives have before asked their employees to work unpaid or take unpaid leave as the company struggles with rising fuel costs and lower revenues. </p>

The employee told an employment tribunal that the company had a ‘culture of hostility’ towards Christianity and did not give her faith equal treatment as the faiths of other employees.  Several months later, British Airways relaxed its rules concerning the display of religious symbols, and she was allowed to return to work. </p>
