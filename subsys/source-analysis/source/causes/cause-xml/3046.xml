  <description>This cause has been made to spread the Islamic belief through one single group of Muslims.  No Sunni, Shia, or any other sect. Islam is one single religion! The Prophet Mohammed (SWS) never said there are Sunni's and there are Shia. We all believe in the same beautiful faith, therefore we must all submit to the one and only belief of a one and only United Ummah of Islam.



1. We must stop the violent divide of Shia and Sunni 

2. Spread Islam through peace as it was during the time of Rasulallah.

3. We must love every Muslim brother and sister.</description>
