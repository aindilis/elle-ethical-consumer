  <description>I want to raise one million dollars for this organization because I think the work that they do with cancer patients is simply unbelievable. The amount of care and effort exerted by each individual in this orginization is unparalelled. There are so many children and families whose lives have been changed because of this orginization and the only way for that to continue is by giving a donation. It can be small but whatever it is you can make a difference. You have the opportunity to put a smile on the face of a young boy who is sick in bed with cancer. The desicion is yours...

1. A smile is sometimes stronger than a needle

2. Love can beat out anything 

3. Dosent everyone deserve to be happy?</description>
