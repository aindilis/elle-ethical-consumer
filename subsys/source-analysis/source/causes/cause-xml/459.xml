  <description>Muscular dystrophy is a group of hereditary diseases of the muscles, leading to progressive muscular atrophy. Those with some forms of the disease can lose the ability to do everyday tasks. As the most dangerous forms of the disease progress, afflicted individuals can be confined to a wheelchair and often eventually die. 

This cause was formed by a group of concerned high school students from FIRST Robotics Team 1515, MorTorq. One of their members, from the animation team, is afflicted with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. He needs a wheelchair for mobility and requires full-time help.  The typical life expectancy for this form of the disease is in the late twenties and early thirties. 

Please help us raise money and awareness to permanently eradicate this terrible disease.
