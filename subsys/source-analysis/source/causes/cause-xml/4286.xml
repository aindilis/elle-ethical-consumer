  <description>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (lupus or SLE) is the 2nd most common autoimmune disease of women in childbearing age.  Thyroid disease is the first.  9 out of 10 people with Lupus are women.  

There are three other types of lupus, drug induced (causes lupus symptoms), discoid lupus (affects the skin) and overlap symptoms which include lupus symptoms in addition to other rheumatic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (deforming joint problems) or Raynaud's syndrome (cold intolerance associated with color changes in the skin).

Lupus can affect many parts of the body, especially the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys.  Most people have mild cases affecting only a few organs.  Some people can have severe cases and it can be life-threatening.

A higher percentage of women of color have lupus than Caucasian women.
