  <description>Hope in Kosovo&#8217; is a fundraising event witch is run by Leon Sinani and Sam Talbot. &#8216;Hope in Kosovo&#8217; is about families in Kosovo that are extremely poor and need money. At the moment we are in the middle of trying to raise &#163;2000 for 3 family&#8217;s that are suffering right now and need living accommodation. When we have raised the &#163;2000 me and Sam Talbot will be taking a trip to Kosovo and the Kosoven News will probably be filming us taking the money to the families, if not we will be taking our own camera and be filming it ourselves and show it to everyone and then get to see the joy on their faces. We would agree to buy them food that will last them for 7-8 months or even build them better houses.






600 million children live in absolute poverty. 30,000 children die each day due to poverty. Number of children in the world: 2.2 billion. Number in poverty: 1 billion (every second child). 400 million children, one in five, have no access to safe water. Meanwhile, unsafe water and sanitation cause about 4,000 child deaths per day. Every year more than 10 million children die of hunger and preventable diseases - that's over 30,000 per day and one every 3 seconds.
