  <description>During the past twenty years, Linda Thieman of St. Henry, Ohio, has made 41 mission trips to Haiti. Her trip destinations normally include Port-au-prince, and Plaissance; however, because of the increasing violence in Port-au-prince, Haiti's capital, Linda now travels to Cap Haitien, Haiti's second largest city. 

Linda's mission work includes visiting hospitals, schools, and orphanages; she brings suitcases of collected supplies on each visit. The supplies are made up of school supplies, toys for children, clothing, OTC drugs, personal hygeine products, and more. Her brother, Ben Huelskamp, is the founder of One Block at a Time, a foundation that supports the building of small houses in Plaissance. In these houses, Plaissance's poorest in the community can stay for free.
