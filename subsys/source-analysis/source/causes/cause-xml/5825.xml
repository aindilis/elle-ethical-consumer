  <description>Unless you were born before 1908, your entire existence on this planet has been missing something...A Chicago Cubs World Championship. This unfortunate drought has brought nothing but sadness and dispair to Cubs Nation. Many people have been born and died without ever seeing the Cubs win it all. It is time we stop this suffering. It is time we just simply BELIEVE. Through positive thought and incredible support of our Cubbies we can make this "The Year of the Cub".

1. The Cubs are the only team worth rooting for.

2. A Cubs World Series ring would be the most beautiful thing in the world.

3. This is The Year of the Cub.</description>
