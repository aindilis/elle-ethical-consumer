  <description>Face it, too many young girls are getting pregnant. They like to party and have fun. Sometimes due to lack of responsibilty they wind up knocked up, with no options but abortion. Frankly, too much time, money and are being put into teen abortions. More time and money need to be put into a better education, and support program for pregnant teens. More precautions need to be taken before teen pregnancy occurs. Like better sex ed classes in school. I'm not saying down with sex, I'm saying down with teen pregnancies! Girls need to grow up and be able to take care of themselves before they take on adult things like sex, and pregnancy. They got a long time before kids are important in the equaion, so live a little, play a bit, but USE PROTECTION!

1. Too Many Unplanned Teen Pregnancies

2. Not Enough Support For Teen Moms

3. Not Enough Sexual Education</description>
