  <description>Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish them from other types of cells. First, they are unspecialized cells that renew themselves for long periods through cell division. The second is that under certain physiologic or experimental conditions, they can be induced to become cells with special functions such as the beating cells of the heart muscle or the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Experimenting with these cells can help cure Juvenile Diabetes, Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and Spinal Cord problems.
