"Are you sick and tired of being fat? Good. If you can't take one more day of self loathing, you're ready to get skinny."

"It's time to prance around in your thong like you rule the world."

"You can NOT keep eating the same shit and expect to get skinny."

"Summer's here and no one wants to see your fat ass at the beach."

Skinny. Ass. Bitches.

1. Sugar is the Devil.

2. You are what you eat.

3. Soda is liquid Satan.

4. No one ever got skinny off junk food.

5. Sugar is like crack.</description>
