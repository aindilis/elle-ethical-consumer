  <description>Ever walk down the street and hear someone say "Hey, you know what the best movie ever is? The Godfather."
When you hear that, do you want to punch that person in the face because they are clearly incorrect? Well, we here at AAA want to make it illegal to state that any movie is superior to Anchorman. Because Anchorman is the greatest movie ever, its a scientific fact!

1. Anchorman is the greatest movie ever.

2. It must be given adequate respect.

3. A statement that any other movie is greater shall be treated as heresy.</description>
  <mission>Make it known that Anchorman is indeed the greatest movie, nay, piece of art, ever created</mission>
