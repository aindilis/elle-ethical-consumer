  <description>Global Refuge International (GRI) seeks to provide refuge for people displaced (forced to leave their homes and lives) by persecution, poverty, war and disaster worldwide.   

GRI is currently providing physical, emotional and spiritual health care to people in northern Uganda, Burma, and Thailand.  All GRI programs are built on training and equipping indigenous people to bring about sustainable positive change in their communities.

GRI was founded in 2001 and is a registered non-profit organization in the United States. GRI works in the areas of international development, disaster relief and advocacy for the forgotten people of the world.

Please join us in helping to bring hope to hurting people on the run, worldwide.

Do something to help......get up, call someone, fly somewhere, scream, run in circles, tell someone, sell something, buy something, give.....just DO SOMETHING to help those that have been forgotten around the world.
