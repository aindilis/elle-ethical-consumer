  <description>Westboro Baptist Church is a Church in Kansas.  Many of you have off-handedly heard of this church but will not recognize it unless I told you that this church were the ones who for one went to the funeral service for Mathew Shepard, a teen who was lured from a bar by two young men pretending to be gay and then tortured him in a field after tieing him to a barb-wired fence and leaving him to die in the pneumonia causing weather.  When they showed up they came with signs saying "God hates fags" and "When Fags die God Laughs".   They need to know that God hates no one and that we as homosexuals and heterosexuals will not allow them to walk all over us.

They also visit High Schools and other community places to send their corrupt message

1. The WBC's false preaching must end immediately.

2. We must let as many LGBT teens and adults know that there is a place for them in this world.

3. To Peacefully end their Protests

4. To stop them from Protesting at public schools</description>
