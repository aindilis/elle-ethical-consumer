  <description>Adam's Camp is a Colorado-based nonprofit organization created to provide a variety of intensive, personalized and integrated therapeutic programs for children with special needs and their families as well as recreational programs for youth and young adults with moderate developmental disabilities.

Based in Denver, Colorado, Adam's Camp offers a variety of programs for kids with special needs from infants through young adults. The Intensive Therapy Programs and Transition Program provide team based, interdisciplinary treatment.  Small groups of pediatric therapists work one-on-one with 5 children over 5 consecutive days.  They focus on each child's needs and assets, providing coordinated, outcome based treatment. 

Families are a big part of all therapy programs.  Adam's Camp offers families the support they need to understand, treat, advocate for and enjoy their child and his siblings.

Adventure Camps offer youth and young adults with moderate disabilities a sleep-over camp experience - away from parents. The goal is to have fun in the mountains while learning to be independent and to enjoy social activities.
