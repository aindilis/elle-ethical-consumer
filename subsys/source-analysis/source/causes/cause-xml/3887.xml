  <description>The Chinatown Health Clinic Foundation is a non-profit organization that was established in 1995 in reponse to the need for increased access to health services in the Asian American community of New York City. The primary beneficiary of the Foundation, the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center, provides quality, culturally-competent primary and social services to patients regardless of income level. The majority of the patients served by the Health Center are recent immigrants who face tremendous barriers to health services. In 2006, the Health Center saw a steady increase in the number of patients served. The Center plants to continue to expand and enhance its services to help meet the continuing demand in the community.
