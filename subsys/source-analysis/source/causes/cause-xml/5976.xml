  <description>Pistols for Pandas is a just cause. 

Last year alone, the PFP put 300 firearms in the paws of under priveleged and unarmed pandas - WORLDWIDE.

If you're like us and you like to eat pandas, get out of your tiki hut and join us in our fight to arm the little paws of these stupid fat creatures by buying all of our playsets and toys.

if you care about these little guys, and maybe, someday, want to eat them.  help us.


1. Pandas are stupid, fat and slow creatures.

2. Pandas need all the firepower they can get.

3. Pandas are cute and delicious.</description>
