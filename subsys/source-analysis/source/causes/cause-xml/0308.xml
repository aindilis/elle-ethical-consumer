With more than 230 Chabad Centers stretching across the full length and breadth of Israel, Chabad's Terror Victims Project offers support and comfort to victims of terror and their families by providing financial, spiritual and emotional assistance as needed.

Chabad&#8217;s Terror Victims Project includes a network of emergency response teams that intervene with victims and their families within hours after an attack and continues with long term, community-based assistance and activities provided by Chabad Houses located in the victim&#8217;s community.
