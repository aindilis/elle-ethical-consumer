  <description>I flew in the airplane twice, to go to Los Angoleos and to come back. And in the airplane, when you go on the airplane, they say, "Okay so you buckle your seatbelt like this. You do this. You breath the mask. You do this. You do this. Please turn of all electric things."

OH, OKAHY. Guess what I will turn off? I will turn off my ELECTRIC PACEMAKER. deep deep deep......dead.

OH THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA. 

Oh, oh no my friend he just died cause he turned off his pacemaker... let me call the pilot and the 911. Ring - Oh, sorry, no cellphones, that's electricity. My friend is dead. I can't help him. Uh, yeah. Oh, guess what else I'll turn off? The airlplane turn off the electricity on the airplane beep! TSHHHHHHHH BUCHSHSGHCHGCH. 

Welcome to the 20th century, and now it's the 21st. We use electricity nowadays. 

I just kind of think it's weird that airports don't let you use electricity on airplanes. I mean, we're living in a Brand New Age.

They will soon have lawsuits up to their ears if they keep telling people to turn off electricity.

I'm thinking about someday creating my own airport that let's you use electrics on airplanes, so.

1. Airports must let's use electricity in Airplanes

2. People must stop dying

3. A Brand New Age</description>
