  <description>- A student drops out of high school in America every 26 seconds... and more than one million students drop out each year.

- Of the 24 most developed nations in the world, the US boasts an education system that ranks only... 18th.

- A child born into the poorest fifth of families in America is SEVEN times less likely to have the chance to go to college than a child born in the wealthiest fifth of families.

- According to the 2003 National Assessment of Educational Progress, two out of every three American students cannot read at grade level proficiency.

Our Education is a youth-founded and youth-led non-partisan non-profit organization that believes that each of these statistics point to the most troubling issue facing our nation's future: millions of American youth simply are not receiving the quality of education they need and deserve to succeed in the 21st century.  We are dedicated to building a large-scale, nationwide movement of students to change this, and we're looking for young people like YOU to take the lead! 

1. All American children deserve access to high quality educational opportunities.

2. We possess all of the resources and know-how necessary to make #1 (above) a reality, what is missing is the public and political will to make it happen.

3. Young people have valuable experiences and perspectives that must be consulted by policy makers in order to improve our schools.</description>
