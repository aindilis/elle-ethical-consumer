  <description>Deep River Tribe is a vehicle for connecting already existing philanthropies, Non Governmental Organizations, volunteers, celebrities, musicians and donors

Launching teams at schools nationwide to compete for the common good. 

Each team will be armed with a video camera and film their beer pong for charity, innovative meetings, benefit concerts...

You pick a local charity in your town to support as well as a grassroots non-profit working hard on the ground in Africa

Deep River will provide support and help you along the way. Give you ideas of folks to help, ways to get more students involved... you keep it fun and interesting!

Videos will be loading on our site and voted on once a month. Music related prizes will be awarded to killer teams. At the end of the year, two teams will win.

Most online votes and most money raised. Yall will be sent to help the NGO you worked so hard to support in Africa! 

We believe: in the power of you and your energy and hope and in the power of music to bring us all together... 

1. In the power of the youth collective: we have energy and hope and can use to make this world a little bit happier and healthier

2. In the power of music to bring us together for a common good

3. In a deep river that runs through and connects us all, it's a small world, let's work together</description>
