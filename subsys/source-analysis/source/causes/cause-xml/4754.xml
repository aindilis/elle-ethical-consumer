  <description>Iams is a cruel place that mistreats animals! Tests are carried out on innocent cats and dogs to see how they react to the food that Iams supplies. These animals are kept in steel cages with nothing to lay on but the steel bars beneth their feet. These animals are never comforted or loved, they are never played with or given toys. The only time these cats and dogs come into contact with people is to be tested in very inhuman ways. So please stop supporting Iams by buying their food. If more and more people realize that Iams is a horrible place, maybe one day all the cruelty and abuse that goes on at Iams will stop. 

1. Cruelty to animals is wrong!

2. Iams must be shut down.

3. Buy crealty free pet food.</description>
