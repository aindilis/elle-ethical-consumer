  <description>I understand within the past years our school has experienced many costly &amp; time consuming threats of Bombs &amp; other illegal circumstances but I, along with a majority of the student body, agree that these are no cause for our rights of privacy to be violated. As the years pass, The students lose more &amp; more trust in the school system to where many feel that they are being treated as criminals and that the schools only minimize their actual rights. I ask you this, why should evolving adults feel untrusted and holden against their rights in a place that is supposed to be preparing them for the real world? What exactly is that preparing us for? What is this "mesh" really bringing but more drama?
And so, we come to year 2 of the MHS pertitioners. Another year to help put a stop to this nonsense. We have a new class of freshmen coming, and they are more than likely one of the biggest classes. We still have our signatures and we are not giving up hope. This year could be the year that we stop the backpacks, and maybe Sisler all together!

1. Sisler needs to know

2. Our Voice should be heard

3. Action must take place

4. Student rights must be protected</description>
