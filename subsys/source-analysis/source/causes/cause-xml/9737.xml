  <description>QSAC is an award winning non-profit organization dedicated to providing services to persons with autism and/or pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) throughout New York City and Long Island.

QSAC was established in 1978 by a group of parents who were concerned about the lack of services available for their loved ones with autism. These parents strongly believed that people with autism were capable of living at home and participating in normal social activities, forming relationships, maintaining employment and becoming productive members of the community. The founders of QSAC were determined to serve the needs of their children, and those that followed, by providing a cost-effective, community-based alternative to life long institutionalization. Through their commitment and energy, QSAC was born.
