  <description>DrugSense and its largest project MAP combine to form a 501 c3 non-profit corporation. We exist to provide accurate information relevant to drug policy in order to heighten awareness of the extreme damage being caused to our nation and the world by our current flawed and failed "War on Drugs." We aim to inform the public of the existence of rational alternatives to the drug war, and to help organize citizens to bring about needed reforms.
