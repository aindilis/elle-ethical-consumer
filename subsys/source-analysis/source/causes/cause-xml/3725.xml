  <description>Many dogs are born deaf or blind in our comunities every day. Many people believe that they should be put down as they will never live a normal life..... Well this is Angels story......
Angel was born in King, Ontario. She was born completely deaf. She was the first puppy picked out of the litter. The strongest, largest, brightest eyed puppy. At the age of 3 weeks old the breeders found out she was deaf. The buyers decided automatically that they didnt want her and said that she should be put down as she would never be good at anything. I have fallen in love with her, she plays, she knows how to sit, shake a paw, comes with hand signals. She does everything a normal dog does. I believe that with a little bit of help and understanding, less of these dogs will be put down or be left in shelters to rott!!!   A DEAF DOG IS STILL A GREAT DOG!!!!

1. deaf dogs deserve to have families

2. deaf dogs make great companions

3. you wouldnt abandon your deaf child so why do it to a dog</description>
