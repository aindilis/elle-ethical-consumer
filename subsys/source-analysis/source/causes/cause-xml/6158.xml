  <description>Free trade oppresses, depresses, and represses the common man. The corporate world is the only beneficiary of free trade policies, while domestic workers are forced to compete with cheap foreign laborers. In essence, free trade agreements pit the common, working-class people from one country against those from another country, attempting to lower wages and boost corporate profits. 
Domestic taxes on imports (tariffs) curb the problems associated with free trade, encouraging each nation's economy to operate for its own benefit and within its own borders and discouraging the shifting of manufacturing and services overseas.

1. Free trade is detrimental to the working class.

2. Free trade exchanges sovereignty for increased corporate profits.

3. Free trade leads to lower wages, worse working conditions, and fewer labor rights for workers.</description>
