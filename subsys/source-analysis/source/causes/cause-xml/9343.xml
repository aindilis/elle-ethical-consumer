  <description>SPARK THE WAVE is a 501(c)(3) organization incorporated in Pennsylvania that serves the Philadelphia and Washington, DC communities. SPARK THE WAVE operates free after-school and weekend seminars, providing an opportunity for middle and high school students to develop their skills in effective communication, leadership development, service learning, project planning and the awareness of diversity issues.

For students who wish to pursue advanced training, Spark the Wave offers a 6-day residential and day camp program for a nominal fee, which covers room, board and educational materials. In keeping with our mission of encouraging service, most of our staff are volunteers. The summer camp, called Wave Week, is for students in grades 7-11 and is held on a college campus near Philadelphia.

To maintain the momentum generated at Wave Week and our seminars, students completing our trainings are offered access to a long-term mentoring program. Each student has access to adults with expertise in areas such as non-profit management, fundraising and volunteer programming. Through this mentoring, we help increase each student&#8217;s likelihood for success in the world of service.
