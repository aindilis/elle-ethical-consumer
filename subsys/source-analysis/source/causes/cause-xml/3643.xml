  <description>For many long years the Earth Federation has ignored the rights and freedoms of those living in space. This injustice has gone on far too long, and the Principality of Zeon has had enough. We of the Principality believe that the Earth Federation should be overthrown, and that a new, more effective regime be put into place. Join us in our war against the rotten Federation! Hail Zeon!
