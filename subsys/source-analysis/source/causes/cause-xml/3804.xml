  <description>This is a nonprofit organization that I started. Its even certified through the state of MN. We dont have a 501(c)3 yet. The paperwork is still being processed, it should be cleared soon. If you donate to us until that point, the money will go to Invisible Children, an organization that I strongly support.

Its a oranization designed to bring awareness to the current situation of Darfur, Sudan, and Northern Uganda. This area of East Africa is plauged by murderers, rapists, kid nappers, genocide, and corruption. Because of this over 400,000 people have died already, more than 2.5 million are displaced, and hundreds to thousands more are killed, tortured, and left homeless every day.

We do  fundraisers to help the victims there. We have our own clothing line of tee-shirts, totebags  and bracelets. We sell Invisible Children Merchandise as well.

Mostly however, we are concerned with education. All I want to do is educate everyone about what is really going on, and what they can do to help.

1. Everyone should be educated on these atrocities.

2. More UN peacekeeps need to get to Darfur, ASAP.

3. One person can make a difference.</description>
