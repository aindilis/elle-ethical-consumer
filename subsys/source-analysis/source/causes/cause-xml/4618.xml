  <description>Our central goal is education. By highlighting alternative voices, especially those that have been pushed to the margins, we hope to contribute to a greater insight and awareness of the injustices that exist in society, and the many efforts at the grassroots to right these wrongs. The Center&#8217;s projects include the book publisher Haymarket Books, the bimonthly magazine International Socialist Review, and the annual Socialism educational conference. We hope you&#8217;ll support the activities of the Center by clicking on the links below to find out more about these projects.
