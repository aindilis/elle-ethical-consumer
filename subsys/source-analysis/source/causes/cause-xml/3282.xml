  <description>This page is dedicated to all the loyal fans of clubs that have honour, dignity and love and respect. And is created to help clubs that do not share such values (i.e. Liverpool FC) but have values of hatred, spite, anger, retribution and disregard for humanity. And instead of repenting, Liverpool is a team that has never won the premiership, they go about boasting how good they are. This is pride in action.  They are also known to always get their way. If they lose their match, its because the kick-off times were too early. If they lose a big game, they just kill a few Italians and spectators in anger. If they don't qualify for Champions League, they prefer to nullify the law and cause the actual team that qualified to be forced to go through a qualifier. Herein lies the disrespect and self-centredness.  this cause is to help such fans realise the errors of their ways and repent

1. Liverpool is arrogant and proud -- we must help them to humble themselves

2. Liverpool kills innocent people by the wrongfully displaced passion.  We must stop all injustice and inhumane practices.

3. Liverpool fans do not understand the word "fan". We need to show them that true fans care and do not constantly whine and cause disorder to the human </description>
