  <description>"The essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for capital is wage labor. Wage labor rests exclusively on competition between the laborers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the laborers, due to competition, by the revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable."

1. Global capitalism has been responsible for the major harms of the world

2. The only way to stop capitalism is to destroy the system through any and every means

3. There must be a realignment of ethics toward the impending Revolutionary event, in order to exclude oneself from the materialistic ethics of the current self-creating capitalist dogma

4. Regardless to what comes, the Revolutionary event is a precursor to any signifcant systemic change</description>
