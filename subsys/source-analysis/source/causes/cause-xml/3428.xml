Students for Peace is a club that has been set up at Millburn High School in New Jersey that is trying to branch out to other high schools. We set up this project to send postcards for peace in hopes of raising our president's awarness about the price of war. We have been selling postcards with a personal message to president Bush. The proceeds have been collected to donate to Homes For Our Troops.
