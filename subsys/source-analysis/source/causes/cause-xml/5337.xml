  <description>Horizon Gate is a community of writers, filmmakers and performing artists which draws people to God.

Our vision is to build the community of believing artists through working together on films. We are planning The PRODUCTION GATHERING to demonstrate collaboration, nurture creative relationships, mentor and help each other grow spiritually and artistically.

Our vision is to build the community of believers in the world through significant conversations stimulated by the art and films we make. We plan to exhibit the films and art used to make them in The FILM-GALLERY-CAFE. Rather than a dark, impersonal movie theater: a quality art gallery with digital screen and sound, a cafe-like freedom for conversation.

 Our vision is to build the freedom and resources of our artists and arts supporters to fund our shared mission. We are developing FINANCIAL HEALTH through accelerated debt elimination, cash flow, equity, assets, residual income resulting in the resources for the mission shared in our community.
