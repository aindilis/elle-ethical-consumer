  <description>Almost Home Animal Rescue League is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to finding loving 
forever homes for homeless animals. We are strongly against the senseless act of euthanasia of adoptable animals and are continuously striving to make euthanasia a thing of the past.

We are made up of a group of 
dedicated volunteers, without 
them, Almost Home Animal Rescue 
League would not exist. 

The Almost Home Animal Haven 
of Southfield is a "REAL" no-kill 
shelter.

A place where frightened animals need not be frightened. Where animal's with special needs are not discriminated against. A place that radiates warmth and love to all animals whether they are young or old, sick or healthy, maimed or beautiful. A place to feel safe and "BE" safe. We rely solely on the generosity of animal lovers like you. Your donation could mean the difference between the life and death of an animal.

1. No animal should be put to death simply because of an arbitrary time limit for adoption

2. No animal should be sold to a testing lab simply because of an arbitrary time limit for adoption

3. Pets make great friends!</description>
