  <description>The Sandy Hook Fire &amp; Rescue Company has been protecting the residents of Sandy Hook since 1938.  We offer fire, rescue, and emergency medical services to the citizens of Sandy Hook, as well as to the rest of the town of Newtown and through mutual aid to surrounding communities.  All of our members are volunteers who spend their free time helping you.  We get little funding from the town and we depend on your donations and the members of the community supporting our fund raisers. 

We have two fire stations in Sandy Hook equipped with apparatus to respond quickly to you.  Our Main Station is located at 18-20 Riverside Road and our sub station is located at 249 Berkshire Road (Route 34).  We have 8 pieces of apparatus that are ready to respond to any emergency.  These include 2 tankers, 3 pumpers, 1 rescue, 1 brush truck, and our newest truck, a 75' quint.

Our fire department is led into action by Chief Bill Halstead.  He has been chief since 1978 and a member since 1965.  We currently have 61 active members, 3 Junior Members and 10 support members.  We also have a Ladies Auxiliary who supports the fire department.
