  <description>The Marsh Fork Elementary School in Sundial, West Virginia is located 400 yards downslope from a mountaintop removal mine. The mining site above the school, operated by Massey Energy, houses the Shumate sludge impoundment. With 2.8 billion gallons of coal sludge held back by a 385-foot-high earthen dam, it is one of West Virginia&#8217;s largest impoundments. According to the Sludge Safety Project,

    &#8220;sludge contains carcinogenic chemicals used to process coal. It also contains toxic heavy metals that are present in coal, such as arsenic, mercury, chromium, cadmium, boron, selenium, and nickel.&#8221;

Earthen dams used to hold back sludge impoundments are notoriously unstable. A Massey Energy dam failed in 2000 in Martin County, KY dumping 300 million gallons of sludge in streams. A more tragic example is the 1972 Buffalo Creek disaster.
Should the earthen dam of the Shumate impoundment ever be breached, there would be less than three minutes to evacuate the Marsh Fork Elementary School before the water reached 6 feet.

Perhaps most unfortunate for the communities around Sundial is that Massey energy intends to vastly expand the mountaintop removal operation up-slope from the town and school.

1. A new school must be built now.

2. Massey must pay for it or shut down its plant.

3. The bigger problem must be delt with.</description>
