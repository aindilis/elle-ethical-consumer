In a recent blog on his himynameismark web page Mark Hoppus wrote this...

"In the midst of everything else that has happened lately, tom, travis, and i have all spoken together. first through a number of phone calls, and then a couple of weeks ago we all hung out for a few hours. they&#8217;ve all been great, very positive conversations. we&#8217;re just reconnecting as friends after four years of not talking. it&#8217;s a good thing. obviously the first question for a lot of people will be &#8220;does this mean a blink-182 reunion?&#8221; the answer is none of us know. we haven&#8217;t talked about it at all. right now it&#8217;s just good for the three of us to see one another, reconnect, and let the past be the past. the events of the past two months supersede everything that happened before. life is too short."
