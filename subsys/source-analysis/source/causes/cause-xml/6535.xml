  <description>As a graduation requirement from her Florida High school, Ashley Curriston of Niceville, Florida is required to complete a "Capstone Project", which, in layman's terms, is simply a senior project with a whole bunch of technical requirements. Because of the definite problem with suicide among the teens in Niceville, Ashley (with the help of a friend or two), concieved the idea of confronting the problem in a proactive way. When she actually begins her project, Ashley will(hopefully) be vollunteering at a crisis center, speaking to students at the local public schools, and advocating the idea of suicide and crisis prevention through any means possible. After the project itself is completed, Ashley doesn't intend on letting her brainchild dissapear. She is trying to get this program affiliated with the Niceville United Methodist Church, so that when she goes off to college, her legacy will continue on.


This cause is dedicated to all the teenagers in Niceville who felt that there was no other way. You are missed dearly by you loved ones each and every day. Rest in peace, my friends.

1. Suicide is a problem that must be fixed immediately.

2. It is up to those closest to the core of the matter to bring about change with this matter.

3. Everyone's life is intertwined with everyone else's.

4. All people should be given the chance to realize the precious quality of their own lives.

5. No problem is too small to be important.</description>
