  <description>Centrepoint is the national charity working to improve the lives of socially excluded, homeless young people. It provides a range of accommodation based services, including emergency nightshelters and short stay hostels, specialist projects for care leavers, ex-offenders, young single parents, foyers and supported flats and floating support services.

From those foundations, Centrepoint provides the emotional, educational and health support homeless young people need to stay off the streets for good.

Centrepoint is a charity that exists to benefit young people and communities (especially the most excluded, disadvantaged, and marginalised), and does so by being a creative community of staff, volunteers, supporters, clients, donors and partners focused upon the value we create for them.
