  <description>The private health insurance system has failed.  Costs are rising more than three times faster than GDP.  over 46 million Americans are uninsured, and even those with insurance struggle with doctors pressured to cut costs, minimize hospitalization and think more about profit than their patient's health.

It's time to take the profit out of American health.  Single-payer now.

1. The federal government should be commited to making sure every American has health insurance.

2. The private system is fundmentally flawed and any long-term solution that leaves it intact won't work.

3. Progressives should make universal health insurance a staple of the 2008 election.</description>
