  <description>After i had my knee surgery. 
everything was going fine but i had bad pains in my leg. I finally went to the doctor and he had me get an "ultra sound". After i got the results back i found out i had a blood clot. If i didnt have insurence the "ultra sound" would of cost are family 600 dollars. Ths cause is to get people to donate money or meet people who have had blood clots. 

the money will go for paying for the people who dont have the money for an "ultra sound"
