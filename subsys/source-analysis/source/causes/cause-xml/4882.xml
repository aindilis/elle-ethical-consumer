  <description>The Global Fund for Children works to advance the dignity of vulnerable children and youth worldwide.  We believe in supporting local grassroots organizations with modest, meaningful grants to promote innovative and sustainable programs promoting education, health, safety and opportunity.

Since its first grant in 1997, GFC has awarded $12.6 million in grants to more than 323 groups in 69 countries worldwide.

1. Every child has the right to be educated, healthy and safe.

2. A small amount of money, when invested strategically at the community level can make an enormous impact</description>
