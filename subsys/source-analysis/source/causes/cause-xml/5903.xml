  <description>This Cause is to raise awareness of such events. They can happen anytime and place. Hopefully not now with all the security.  We should honor the people, their families, and our every day heroes (Firemen, Policemen, Navy etc) and supporting our fighting troops.

All donations will go to families who have lost their loved ones that day. How is it possible to cope with such a thing? If you were lucky enough to be safe, imagine if you lost your best friend or a family member.

1. Remembering the lives lost

2. Supporting the troops overseas

3. There needs to be an end to terrorism</description>
