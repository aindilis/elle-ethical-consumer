  <description>Thousands of children are displaced from their homes and villages and have to flee every night to avoid abduction by the rebel army of Uganda, Africa, called the Lord's Resistance Army. These children sleep on little more than dirt, mud, and water and have nothing to call their own. They need our help for clothes, sanitation, healthcare, facilities, and help for abducted soldiers who return home with serious mental problems.

1. These children need our help, because they have nothing and we have so much.

2. We will not forget them.

3. The world needs to become more aware of the atrocities that are happening around our globe, this one in Uganda, Africa.</description>
