  <description>&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Like an awards show for social change, we're going to have fun and raise money for the &lt;b&gt;Drum Major Institute&lt;/b&gt;.

You're invited to come hang out with other New Yorkers committed to &lt;b&gt;creating social change&lt;/b&gt; at the Drum Major for Justice Awards.&lt;td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wordofblog.net/redirect.php?id=4301"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.wordofblog.net/ad_images/43013240.gif" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size:78%;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wordofblog.net/info.php?id=4301"&gt;Want this badge? All the cool kids are 
rocking one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Author and PBS talk show host &lt;b&gt;Tavis Smiley&lt;/b&gt; will be honored for being an outstanding voice for social change in the news media and beyond. &lt;b&gt;Mayor Mike Bloomberg&lt;/b&gt; will be honored for PlaNYC, his sweeping plan to make New York City a model for environmentally sustainable cities in the 21st century.

&lt;b&gt;Dr. Cornel West&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Rev. Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.&lt;/b&gt; will be presenting the Drum Major for Justice Awards.

1. That no one likes rubber chicken.

2. That everyone likes a good party.
