  <description>The Petition for a Global Expansion of Educational Youth Exchange Programs

We, the undersigned, know that peace and justice require that we extend the hand of friendship across borders, cultures and religions and that knowledge and understanding are needed to nurture these friendships.

The nations of the world can promote peace by helping the world&#8217;s youth build these friendships.

Therefore we call upon the world&#8217;s leaders to enable young people everywhere to live and study in cultures other than their own by significantly expanding youth exchange programs.

Friendship leads to understanding. Understanding leads to peace. We call on all to grasp this opportunity.
