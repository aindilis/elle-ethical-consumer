  <description>Innocent civilians on both sides &#8212; especially vulnerable children, the elderly and the sick &#8212; are being harmed by the ongoing violence. The UN estimates nearly 900,000 people have been displaced by the conflict. Few agencies have been able to reach Southern Lebanon, where the fighting is most intense. Mercy Corps has been able to reach the Southern village of Marjayoun with critical food supplies and blankets.

As one of the few humanitarian agencies with a long-term presence in Lebanon, we are especially well positioned to contribute to the response, and are working to reach 100,000 vulnerable people with vital food, water and supplies
