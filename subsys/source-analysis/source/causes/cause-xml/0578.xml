  <description>Student/Farmworker Alliance (SFA) is a national network of students and youth organizing in direct partnership and solidarity with farmworkers to eliminate sweatshop conditions and modern-day slavery in the fields.  We organize closely with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a membership-led community organization in SW Florida comprised largely of Latino, Haitian, and Mayan Indian immigrants working in agricultural and other low-wage jobs throughout the state.

We believe that only farmworkers can speak for themselves.  SFA is dedicated to working with farmworkers for change, but we will not act on their behalf. Instead, we take our lead from the workers themselves. This affirms a belief in direct action and direct democracy where people and communities act through their own power to control and change their own lives.
