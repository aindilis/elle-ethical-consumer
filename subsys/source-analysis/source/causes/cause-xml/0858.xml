  <description>Half of the world's poorest people are children and there are more babies born into poverty than ever before.  Despite major advances in medicine, science and technology, one out of four babies is born into extreme poverty and adverse conditions. 

Christian Children's Fund understands that poverty is a complex problem, and has more than 65 years of experience in identifying and addressing the root causes of poverty. Within the context of alleviating child poverty, vulnerability and deprivation, CCF creates programs in a variety of different areas that provide practical assistance to impoverished communities and plant the seeds of self-sufficiency. 

CCF's integrated development model is made up of interventions in six primary sectors:

Early Childhood Development  

Health and Sanitation  

Education 

Nutrition 

Family-Income Generation  

Emergency and Disaster Relief
