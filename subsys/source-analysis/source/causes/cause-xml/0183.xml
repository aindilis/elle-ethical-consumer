  <description>More than 1 MILLION CHILDREN DIE EACH YEAR from an easily preventable disease called MALARIA.  This is a human tragedy borne by mosquitoes and suffered upon impoverished children in third world countries around the world, though mostly in Africa.  

SAVE A CHILD FOR TEN DOLLARS. SERIOUSLY. 

 What's the cost of preventing these tragic deaths?  Ten American Dollars.  Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?  But the United Nations Foundation Nothing But Nets campaign has partnered with other agencies to provide bed nets -- delivered and installed -- for $10 per home.  These nets are the easiest and most successful means for preventing malaria.

PLUS, THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION MATCHES EVERY DONATION THAT NOTHING BUT NETS RECEIVES!

1. Children shouldn't have to die from mosquito bites

2. $10 can save a child's life

3. We can eradicate malaria -- and 1 million deaths a year</description>
