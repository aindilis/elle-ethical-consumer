  <description>Tired of being asked to donate to Children's Charities? Tired of watching disease-ridden Orphans on World Vision? Tired of well-meaning people putting guilt trips on rich people like you to donate money so that someone else can breed irresponsibly?

Join the cause to encourage people not to donate to people who perpetuate the poverty cycle by breeding and then not being able to afford to feed their kids.

The Critics say that they are not educated and don't realise that having sex leads to babies. .. Errmm DUH? What do they think that having sex leads to?

Some are victims of rape. Ok we'll send money for an abortion.

Some cannot afford condoms. Fine, then don't have sex. Heck...it'd be a hell lot cheaper to send a boat load of rubbers.

1. People should be responsible for their own actions.

2. Breeding is a privilege not a right.

3. Universal accessibility of Birth Control.</description>
