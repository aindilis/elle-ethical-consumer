  <description>The fifth of November is variously called Firework Night, Bonfire Night or Guy Fawkes Night. An Act of Parliament (3 James I, cap 1) was passed to appoint 5 November in each year as a day of thanksgiving for "the joyful day of deliverance". The Act remained in force until 1859. On 5 November 1605, it is said the populace of London celebrated the defeat of the plot by fires and street festivities. 

Why should such an event be celebrated, Guy Fawkes wanted freedom for his Kingdom, free from the rule of the Tyrant King James I. Yet every year on November 5th, England celebrates this day. This must be stopped and Guy Fawkes memory must be ovenged.

1. Guy Fawkes was right

2. England shouldn't Celebrate Guy Fawkes Day

3. November 5th should be a day of remembrance and education</description>
