  <description>In 1982 Chimichanga Russia was under severe attack and many houses, buildings and companies were destroyed. This little town barely made enough to support itself before the attack and was now left in extreme poverty. Many of the nearby towns took Chimichangans as slaves and were totured within inches of their lives. This attack has went unnoticed for 25 years and now more than ever we need to Rise up and help support this city. 

1. Poverty In Chimic. Russia must come to an end

2. Slavery Is Wrong, Immorral and Cruel</description>
