  <description>For years vegitarians and vegans have refused to eat meat.  Now hundreds of kind jolly butchers are out of jobs.  With thousands of animals being spared death unused livestock release untold amounts of methane into the air.  Soon the world temperature will rise a total 1 thousandth of a percent causing global devistation.  With all the plants being eaten there will be nothing to sustain the nations of the earth once all the plants die from global warming.  With your help and others like you we can end this tragedy waiting to happen.  Donate lots of money before you all die.
