  <description>A developer has put forward preliminary plans at a Fall 2006 Zoning Board meeting for a STRIP MALL sited behind the corner at Rt.295 and Rt.22. At this date (Spring 2007) the developer says he has all the permits needed to move forward (although the town says he has none) and residents have yet to be "officially" allowed to discuss the proposal in town meetings. It's TIME TO DECIDE what's best for our town.

PS At the moment, the Beneficiary is the Queechy Lake Club, because it was the closest available, but I am trying to find a way to make it saveCanaanCountry.com

1. Preserve the state of the lush environment.

2. Keep the economy local.

3. STOP URBAN SPRAWL IN CANAAN!</description>
