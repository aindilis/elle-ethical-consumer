  <description>Originally there were 15.5 million square kilometres of tropical rainforest worldwide. Today, as a result of deforestation, just over 5 million square kilometres remain. 

The rainforest continues to shrink rapidly: almost two acres disappear every second! This leads to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Experts estimate that the last remaining rainforests could be consumed in less than 40 years.

But you can do something to help. You can save acres of the rainforest for free by visiting www.therainforestsite.com and just click on the "Preserve Endangered Land" button. Your click triggers a donation from the sponsors of the site. Each click saves one square metre of rainforest. At Adopt an Acre, you can adopt an acre of Brazillian rainforest for only US$50. Think of all the wildlife that will be protected in that single acre of land.
