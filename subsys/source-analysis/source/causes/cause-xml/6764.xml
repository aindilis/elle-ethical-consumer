  <description>Our Mission is:

* To be a prophetic voice that proclaims the radically inclusive love of God for all, which we understand through Jesus Christ.
* To call the Church of the Brethren to embody Christ's love more fully.
* To model this love as a group and live it out. 

We will fulfill our mission by:

* Emphasizing the development of a deeper spirituality within the Church of the Brethren.
* Studying the Bible, especially Christ's teachings, with open eyes, ears, hearts, and minds. We believe the Bible is best understood when we use all possible tools of study and interpretation, which include Spiritual discernment and communal conversation.
* Supporting and encouraging all persons to offer their gifts to Christ and the church.
* Creating safe, "grace-filled" spaces to explore all the questions of our faith.
* Identifying and collaborating with organizations that are supportive of our values and concerns.
* Working with and building bridges to those persons, especially within the Church of the Brethren, who do not share the goals and values of Voices for an Open Spirit.
