  <description>The United States is a nation of immigrants, immigrants from all the nations of the world. Our speech is a patchwork of many tongues, but this has caused an adverse effect upon the Catholic liturgy.

Churches are obliged to provide Masses and Offices in two, sometimes three, languages, which divides the parish by language and culture. However, this stems from a common liturgical misconception.

While the Second Vatican Council permitted the use of the vernacular language in the liturgy, it did not require it by any means. To this day, the General Instruction of the Roman Missal gives the Latin language, the language of St. Augustine and Constantine the Great, special precedence. It is indeed a universal language for the Church.

Parishes will no longer needlessly separate the peoples of the congregation with numerous different Masses if they unite under a single, ancient, noble tongue where the vernacular is unclear.

1. The use of the "vernacular" in liturgies in multiethnic areas is an obstacle to Christian unity.

2. This can be counteracted by the use of the universal Latin language.</description>
