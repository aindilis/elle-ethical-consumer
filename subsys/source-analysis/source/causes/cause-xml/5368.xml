  <description>Below is the story of the original description of the cause. However, now it is a cause to remind those that prayer may not always physically heal people, but it may spiritually affect them. This is now the cause for those who believe that's God can perform miracles, a cause for those who now will pray for my dad, me, and all of our friends who were affected by my mom and her amazing personality along with her belief in God.



In May of 2007, Miko Bumpus (my mom) was diagnosed with Stage 4 Stomach Cancer. This is a cancer that cannot be cured in any way; the tumor will only shrink. The doctors have given her a few weeks left to live and she is in need of a miracle. For those who have met my mom, you can testify that she is a very strong-willed and amazing person with a radiating personality. What is so strange is that she had perfect health and the doctor had told her about 7 months before she was diagnosed how he couldn't believe how healthy she was. She then had several tumors the size of tennis balls removed through a full hysterectomy and was supposed to get better. It seemed like she was until she suddenly became ill. Within 2 weeks she went from not having cancer to having it in the 4th stage. Right now visitors are welcome to see her and prayers are much appreciated. Please pass this on to anyone you know. A miracle is needed in my family today, a miracle from God.

1. Miracles happen through the power of prayer.

2. Prayer is essential in times of despair.</description>
