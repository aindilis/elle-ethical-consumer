  <description>One state; with human rights, justice and cupcakes for all. 

1. Palestinians must be allowed their right of return. 

2. All settlement colonies are illegal and must be dismantled immediately. 

3. The apartheid wall must be abolished along with Israel's inhumane apartheid policies.

4. Israel must recognize and adhere to international laws, and Israel must be made responsible, currently and retroactively, for all violations of such laws and United Nations resolutions.

5. Palestinians must receive appropriate reparations for all land, homes, loved ones, monies, property, trees, childhoods, blood, time and security robbed from them since 1948.</description>
  <mission>To make the world aware that colonization, apartheid and ethnic cleansing is NEVER delicious. Rather, cupcakes are (except walnut-flavored. Eww. You zionuts can keep those for yourselves).</mission>
