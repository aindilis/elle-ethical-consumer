  <description>For more than 25 years NISGUA has been coordinating grassroot movements in Guatemala and the United States and working on human rights issues in Guatemala.  One of the most important causes NISGUA is currently working on is the legal action being brought against some of the primary members of the administrations responsible for the extreme violence and repression between 1960 and 1996 (including Efrain Rios Montt). Through the Guatemalan Accompaniment Program (G.A.P.), NISGUA assigns volunteers to different parts of Guatemala in order to deter violence and intimidation of human rights workers.

1. Those responsible for the 200,000+ deaths in Guatemala durin "La Violencia" need to be brought to justice.

2. CAFTA promotes the &#8220;rights&#8221; of corporations at the expense of local populations.</description>
