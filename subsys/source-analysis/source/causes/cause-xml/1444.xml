Though, the beautiful girls foundation does discriminate against ugly girls, we are in no way trying to encourage violence against ugly girls. 

As well as it should be noted that none of the money collected will support "decent looking, average looking, or below average looking" girl.

3. Beautiful Girls make the world a better place for you &amp; I</description>
