  <description>It is every man's duty and obligation to take up arms and fight for his country if called upon to do so.  So grab your balls, man up and join up.

I don't expect a lot of people to join this cause because fighting for one's country is a very frightening prospect for most people.  This cause is open only to armed forces recruits, recruiters, future military (especially army and marines and anyone who signed up for combat arms) and supporters.  

If you are an able-bodied man between the age of 18-28, physically and mentally fit for military service, I encourage you to:

1. be registered for the draft so if your mother country needs you, you will be ready to fulfill your duty as a good citizen of your country.
2. enlist in the armed forces of your appropriate country (United States).  it will be the most honorable and noble thing you will ever do in your life.

1. having a standing army is vital to the mere survival of a nation

2. to instill virtues most absent in men: moral courage, patriotism, sense of duty/service

3. it is a man's duty to serve the country which he is a citizen of.</description>
