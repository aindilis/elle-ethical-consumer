  <description>Our mission is to clean the beaches of the mooks and kooks that flood our line up. If there were designated places for the maggots to surf then there wouldn't be as many life threatening situations in the water. People get hurt all the time because the unexperienced surfers think its cool to paddle out when the conditions are not safe for them. WHY!! i dont know

1. Kooks must be redirected to the kiddie waves

2. Homies need to start taking over!

3. LEts get tubed!!!</description>
