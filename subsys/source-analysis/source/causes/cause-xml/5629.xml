  <description>Luekemia and Lymphoma are two diseases that can tear a family apart. I just want to raise awareness for this cause and maybe a little money to aid in the research of a cure. These families gothrough a lot on the day to day and maybe with our support they can live just a little bit easier knowing that someone cares. God Bless You All!

1. Cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma

2. improve the quality of life of patients and their families</description>
