  <description>Hearts in Action International's main focus is ministering to children.  

They run a school in the Pet&#233;n Jungle, where the kids receive not only an education, but also food, clothing, basic healthcare, and love.  HIA also works with the public school system to teach basic virtues to students.  

Visiting missionaries can accompany them on trips to orphanages, hospitals, and public squares.  They also reach out to men and women in prison, rehab centers, dumps, and local villages.
