  <description>Almost all of us grew up eating meat, wearing leather, and going to circuses and zoos. We never considered the impact of these actions on the animals involved. For whatever reason, you are now asking the question: Why should animals have rights? Because animals scream hen theyre tortures in nderground labs or have their thoats slit while they're still concious.. whatever the abuse anumals have suffered it. Stomping kicking and beating chickens pigs and cows doesent make the food better or the animal feel any better so why do it. because there are sick people who just want to.

1. Animals feel like we do.

2. Fur belongs to the animals.

3. Animal rights are just as important as ours.</description>
