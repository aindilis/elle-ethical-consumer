  <description>reported last month on the rescue of 24 starving orphans by the 82nd Airborne Division and Iraqi soldiers in Baghdad. The boys were discovered emaciated, wounded and tied to beds. Troops brought them  to safety, and they are being nursed back to health but they  need a new orphanage, found them more comfortable and happyness, but they are still trapped in a life very different than that an American special needs child would live or any child that lives in Iraqi would have a different life then the kids that lives in american and canda.
