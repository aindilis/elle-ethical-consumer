  <description>Established in 1951 after the death of the son of Sigma Sigma Sigma's fourth national President, RPM supported various polio research projects, including the Salk vaccine trials. After the Salk vaccine's success, which erased polio as a critical disease, the RPM fund developed and continues to support play therapy for children. By focusing on the emotional and develomental needs of seriously ill children, funds raised by collegiate and alumnae chapters established both playrooms and fellowships for professionals in the play therapy field.
RPM is supported through the Sigma Sigma Sigma Foundation.
