Heritage Academy is a unique urban Christian school.  We are committed to making quality education available to children from racially, ethnically, socially and economically diverse families. We are committed to not allowing finances prevent a family from obtaining an education; tuition is based off of family income.  Donors provide 80% of the operating budget, while tuition provides 20%.

Please help support the art program at Heritage Academy by donating, telling your friends, or participating in one of our many projects.
