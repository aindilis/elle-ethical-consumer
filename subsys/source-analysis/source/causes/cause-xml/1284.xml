  <description>Want to make a difference in our world?  Dancing for Darfur is a charity aimed at helping the hundreds of thousands of Darfurians who are currently suffering at the hands of the Sudanese government-sponsored Janjaweed militias. We ask you to dance for a difference. We ask you to dance for our generation, to show that we will not tolerate injustice. Did you think Holocausts were a thing of the past? Think again. 
Since the conflict's beginnings in 2003, approximately 400,000 people have been killed. Millions have been displaced due to violence and are facing imminent starvation in refugee camps throughout the region.  It's time that we stand up for universal human rights.  It's time that we dance for a difference.  It's time that we do something for the victims of genocide in Darfur. Together, we can change the world.  All we ask is that you step on the dance floor with us.  Lets start dancing for a difference! Lets start: 

1. To provide students a fun and exciting dance that they will never forget.

2. Encourage policy-makers to do something about what is taking place in Darfur. The genocide has gone on for too long!

3. To raise awareness of the atrocities occurring in Darfur.</description>
