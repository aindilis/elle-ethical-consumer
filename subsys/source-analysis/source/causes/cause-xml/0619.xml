  <description>Every fourteen seconds a child loses a parent to AIDS.

By 2010, an estimated 20 million children worldwide will have been orphaned by AIDS. Thats more than the number of high school students in AMERICA.

Every $17 you raise cares for one child affected by AIDS in Africa this year. You'll be giving children the help they need most- things like:

-Food, Health Care, and other basic needs
-Schooling and the chance to learn job skills
-Visits from caring counselors
-Life-skills training and education based on principles in the Bible to help prevent the spread of HIV.

The dollar amount for all of this is so low because the US government is giving World Vision more than $16 million this year for HIV and AIDS programs in Africa. These programs will help more than 700,000 people in nine countries. But we have to raise more than $13 million to get the full benefits of these grants. That's where you and One Life Revolution come in!

you have one life. do something.

1. One life: Yours.

2. To save one life: a child's.

3. From one disease: AIDS.

4. On one continent: Africa.</description>
