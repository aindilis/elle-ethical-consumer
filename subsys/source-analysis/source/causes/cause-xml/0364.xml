  <description>United Council is suppose to represent ALL UW students however they exclude a large portion of students by the liberal driven agenda.  Instead of helping lower tuition, United Council raises tuition by $4 per semester.  United Council has yet to have a successful lower tuition campaign.  UW schools should invest their time in their student organizations having them come together to lobby for tuition.  United Council DOES NOT represent all students and ALL UW school should pull out.

1. United Council is not representing all students

2. United Council is raising tuition instead of lowering it

3. All UW schools should pull out of United Council</description>
