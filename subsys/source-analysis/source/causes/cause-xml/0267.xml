  <description>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), often referred to as "Lou Gehrig's disease," is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually lead to their death.

The ALS Association directs the most comprehensive, global ALS research program ever organized and is currently overseeing approximately 100 different research projects into all aspects of ALS. During the past decade, The Association has committed $48 million toward ALS research. Each dollar has gone directly to investigators doing the research.
