  <description>Omnivore - Any animal, or human, whose diet includes both the flesh of animals and vegetable material; there may be specialized teeth to deal with the varied foodstuffs. The term contrasts with carnivore (a flesh-eater, such as the lion) and herbivore (a plant-eater, such as the cow).

Note that humans are omnivores, not herbivores.  We eat herbivores.  It's called the circle of life folks.  Yeah, I'm sure I could get through life without needing to murder a cow, but when was the last time you have a peanut that tasted as good?  The solution to the ongoing battle of is eating animals good or bad: FOR EVER ANIMAL YOU DON'T EAT, I'LL EAT THREE!  Besides, more animals die every day in crop harvesting than in actual meat processing.  One cow can feed many people but several animals died to give you that bag of oats.  And really, if we eat all the vegetation, then the cows would die of starvation and I don't believe in waste.  Save the plants, eat animals.  Besides, plants produce the oxygen we need to breath, animals suck it up.  They're stealing our air!
