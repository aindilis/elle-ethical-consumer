  <description>Rock and roll has hit a sharp decline. Our goal is to bring back the music that we love. We are not asking others to change their musical preferences. We just want to revive the immortal genre of music that is rock. Rock includes the following sub-genres: British Invasion, Hippie Rock/Folk, Acid Rock, Punk Rock, Metal (non-screamo), Grunge, Classic Rock, Pop Punk, Ska, Soft Rock, Hard Rock, Satanic Folk, Southern Rock, Adult Alternative (non-emo), Prog Rock, etc.

1. Rock music has been dying out over the last few years

2. Screamo and emo are not classified as rock

3. Other forms of music are not to be bashed inside this cause. Personal opinions are to be withheld.

4. MTV, VH1, and CMT suck

5. VH1 Classic is acceptable</description>
