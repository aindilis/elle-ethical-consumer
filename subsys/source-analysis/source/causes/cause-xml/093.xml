  <description>One third of US Global AIDS prevention funding is earmarked for abstinence until marriage education.  Yet this prioritization is based more on ideology than real evidence of effective prevention.  Indeed, abstinence until marriage is only relevant to those who are legally permitted to marry, excluding same-sex partners.  And it assumes an ability to chose abstinence, hardly the reality for many women and girls across the globe.  Furthermore, the second-priority component of the prevention plan, being faithful, provides safety only so long as both partners in a sexual relationship maintain that fidelity.  Effective AIDS prevention must include condoms.

1. Funding decisions must be based in scientific evidence, not ideology

2. Abstinance and Faithfulness alone will not end the spread of HIV</description>
