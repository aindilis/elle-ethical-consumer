  <description>Our mission is to free women prisoners who were convicted of murder but who acted in self-defense against abusers and did no receive due process or fair trials; and to conduct public education and advocacy for justice and human rights for all women in prison. Our appeals for clemency and parole are based on failures of the criminal-legal system to duly consider the consequences to women of battering relationships and the reasonableness of their actions in the context of repeated violence; and the inaccessibility of the Constitution's promise of justice and equal rights for women.
