  <description>While watching Live Earth, I questioned myself on my carbon output. 
I was already recycling, reducing and conserving but I knew I had to do more.
Besides trying to exchange ideas on my Facebook group," I am Earth", I decided to start this cause.

I hope you'll consider joining up.

1. To share ideas

2. To reduce our carbon footprint

3. To leave Earth better than we found it</description>
