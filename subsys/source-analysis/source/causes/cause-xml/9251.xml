  <description>This year, I'll be participating in a very special event called the Breast Cancer 3-Day.

I'll walk 60 miles over the course of three days with thousands of other women and men. The net proceeds will support breast cancer research, education, screening and treatment through Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the National Philanthropic Trust Breast Cancer Fund.

I've agreed to raise at least $2,200 in donations.  So I need your help. Would you please consider making a donation of $25, $50, $100, or any amoutn you would like? Please keep in mind how far I'm walking -- and how hard I'll have to train.

According to Susan G. Komen for the Cure, approximately 200,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, and nearly 40,000 will die from the disease. That's why I'm walking so far. To do something bold about breast cancer. I hope that you'll share this incredible adventure with me -- by supporting me in my fundraising efforts.

Thank you in advance for your generosity!

You can donate directly online at http://www.the3day.org/cleveland07/cmanglani

I have until September 13, 2007 to raise donations...I truly appreciate your support.
