  <description>We are a group of seven people dedicated to raising money to help bring clean water to the bad parts of Kenya. Even if you don't want to donate ask your parents. This site is for anyone! :)

-Although we are an individual group, all of our donations go straight to "The 410 Brdge." (There is a link for the "410 Bridge" in the top left corner of the page) 

1. We believe that everyone deserves a chance

2. We believe that we as a group of people can change the world

3. We believe that through Jesus Christ anything is possible</description>
