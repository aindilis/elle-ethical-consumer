  <description>Restaurants suing food critics, record labels withdrawing advertising from magazines and streetpress if they don't like the reviews, court cases arguing the semantics of critical prose, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

1. We support critics' - music, art, books, food, theatre, etc - right to free speech without censorship. 

2. The era of the three-and-a-half-star to four-star review policy needs to end NOW.

3. We also argue that critical writing is just as important as journalism and other commentaries, and is an art in itself. Criticism needs to be valued once more, or the next great critical voice will end up stocking shelves.

4. Advertising needs to stop dictating content.</description>
