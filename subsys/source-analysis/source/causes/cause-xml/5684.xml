  <description>Safe Haven Laws allow unwanted births from mothers to be able to give up the child within a certain period of time after the child is born to give to the government so that the child becomes a "ward of the state." 

The mother may turn the child in to any of the following places including hospitals, fire departments, police stations, and so forth. The mother is urged, but not required to give her name and any other information when turnning in the newborn. 

So far in the United States, every state has a Safe Haven Law of some sort except for three states. We want to promote the law to be excepted in these states by the government.

1. Safe Haven Laws must be created in some form or another in every state of America. We must protect abondoned newborns.</description>
