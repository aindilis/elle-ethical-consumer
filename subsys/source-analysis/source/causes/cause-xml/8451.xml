  <description>With representatives nationwide and in Canada and Europe, Dogs Deserve Better works to end a form of animal abuse that is still all too often tolerated, even accepted, in many parts of the country: keeping a dog perpetually chained. 

Recognizing that dogs are intelligent, social animals that suffer greatly if kept chained by the neck 24/7, DDB rescues individual dogs that have spent their lives tethered to stationary objects -- often neurotic from lack of care and attention, with collars embedded in their necks, frustrated from lack of exercise, and yet often -- amazingly -- still full of heart and love, ready to be turned into a family pet. DDB also pushes for legislation that bans 24/7 chaining or severely limits how long a dog may be chained. 

Current animal welfare laws are woefully inadequate to protect man's best friend from a lonely, parasite-ridden life at the end of chain. 

1. The practice of perpetually chaining/caging dogs is a holdover from a less englightened time

2. Dogs are social animals that crave affection and companionship

3. Because it is so widespread and even still widely tolerated, this discrete animal welfare issue deserves special attention</description>
