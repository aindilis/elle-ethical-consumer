  <description>Im fed up with people who cheat at sports.
not just airsoft but all sports.
so if u want to start a Devils Children ___Team
go on ahead

i just need money to get better equipment so i have a way to beat cheaters and donate airsoft gunz to players

1. I believe cheaters should never win

2. I believe winners should never cheat

3. I believe Cheaters should be abolished</description>
  <mission>make a team that will destroy all the teams that cheat</mission>
  <name>Devils children airsoft team</name>
