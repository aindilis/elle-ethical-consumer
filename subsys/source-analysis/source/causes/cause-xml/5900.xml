  <description>Garrett Matejcek recieved a phone bill of exactly $734.70. That is for only one months use. If this keeps up, and we do not give relief, over the course of a year  his total bill will add up to $8,816.40. Please help.

1. The bill was enormously big.

2. Money is an object.

3. Money should not be spent on these silly things.</description>
