  <description>So everyone knows who did our 2007 senior prank. And everyone knows we got caught. Dr. Bull charged us a riduculous amount of money to just paint over the 07 on the roof. It's $3500 which is bullshit but we had to pay otherwise Bull would have turned us over to the police. It was the best prank by far. We would appreciate it if you could donate to us so we can pay for it. Whether you're donating 1 or 1000 dollars, we would appreciate it. We did this prank for our whole class, not just us. if you want to be part of it email me at bjtwolve88@aol.com

1. We want to raise $3500 to pay for the prank

2. Dr. Bull is an ass hole</description>
