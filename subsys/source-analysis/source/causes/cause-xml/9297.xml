  <description>Dictionary definition: Racism is a belief or doctrine that differences in physical appearance between people (such as those upon which the concept of race is based) determine cultural or individual achievement, and usually involve the idea that one's own 'race' is superior. 
I have always wanted to end racism ever since i heard the sotries that made me cry about it in shcool and i hated how cruel people were i guess for people of "different colour" back then was like being born into a nightmare were everybody hates you right before ur even born they judge and sereotype you by what u look like and not what really matters whats on the inside the inner beauty that lies beneath ur soul and i did feel ashamed of my people because i'am white and i feel somewhat responsible for whaT happened way before i was even born and i feel guilty. and i know i had nothing to do with it but its a really confusing feeling to have and now its time to right our wrongs and end this before things get out of control and everybody realizes that everybody is different and nobody is perfect and then there will be a war and not just with white and black but with the red blood that will be shed because people are different.. sound silly i know but it is true and this is what i believe in &lt;3
