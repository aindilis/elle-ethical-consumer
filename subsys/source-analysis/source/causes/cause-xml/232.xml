  <description>The New York Public Interest Research Group (NYPIRG) is New York State's largest student-directed consumer, environmental and government reform organization. We are a nonpartisan, not-for-profit group established to advance policy reforms while training students and other New Yorkers to be advocates. Since 1973, NYPIRG has played the key role in fighting for more than 160 public interest laws and executive orders.

NYPIRG's 21 college campus chapters provide much of NYPIRG's energy, resources, and activism. Each campus chapter consists of a full-time staff organizer and a large core of student volunteers. Students at NYPIRG chapters work on projects that both support NYPIRG's statewide agenda and focus on local issues.

NYPIRG's full-time staff coordinates state campaigns, educates the public, and works with students.

The New York Public Interest Research Group Fund produces studies on a wide array of topics, to educate the general public about vital issues in their communities. NYPIRG Fund has tens of thousands of active citizen supporters across the state who provide grassroots support to make a difference.
