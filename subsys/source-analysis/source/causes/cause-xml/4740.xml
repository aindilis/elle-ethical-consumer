  <description>United Way understands that you really want to make a difference right here in Saginaw County. We want to help you do that.

Here in Saginaw County, we're focused on developing youth, addressing basic needs, promoting health, strengthening families and creating community impact.

It takes the whole community working together to reach our goals. So we bring together people from all across the community - people from business, labor, faith groups, non-profits, and citizens. Creating partnerships... that's what we do, whether it involves fundraising or just getting people to work together. Together, we can get results that no one can accomplish alone.

Your United Way contribution brings results, righ where you live, work or go to school. Because that's what matters!

You can support United Way and your community by either giving your time (volunteering), talent (helping on a committee) or treasure (monetary donation).

Support your Community - give the United Way!
