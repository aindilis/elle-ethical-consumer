  <description>Our planet is facing an imminent threat, species of animals are dying of and becoming extinct, soon species of plants will follow suit. Then too our major cities will all be flooded and there will be a great stampede of humans everywhere towards the highest ground this planet can offer. If man-kind had not driven to work and produced all those unnecessary things and not temperature controlled their surroundings, this all could have been avoided. If those emerging nations had just relied on solar, wind, and hydro-electric power then our doomsday could have been averted...

Such is the myth of anthropogenic global climate change.

It is an unfortunate mis-truth that has lead the a lot of misspent money and a lot of misused power and authority. 


1. Anthropogenic Global Climate Change is a myth.

2. Global citizens need to be made aware of the reality of our planet without being bombarded with lies.

3. The environment is important, but spreading lies about its imminent demise serves no one.</description>
