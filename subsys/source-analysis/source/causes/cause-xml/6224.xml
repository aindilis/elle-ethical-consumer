  <description>Active Abuse Would Be When Someone Maliciously Abuses An Animal As In They Knew It What They Where Doing And Continued And Its Also Reffered As NAI (Non-Accidental Injury). Acts of intentional cruelty are often some of the most disturbing and should be considered signs of serious psychological problems. This type of behavior is often associated with sociopathic behavior and should be taken very seriously.

Passive Abuse Would Be Neglect, Instead Of Doing What You Could To Hurt The Animal, You Simply Arnt Doing Anything At All.Examples of neglect are starvation, dehydration, parasite infestations, allowing a collar to grow into an animal&#8217;s skin, inadequate shelter in extreme weather conditions, and failure to seek veterinary care when an animal needs medical attention.

Active Abuse Or Passive Abuse Its Still Not Okay.
