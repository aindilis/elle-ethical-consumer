  <description>All across the world the Totalitarian Communist regime in China supports other Totalitarian regimes as client states. Name any backwards third-world Dictatorship and odds are there is Chinese money behind it. The UN is dominated by these dictatorships witch far out number the democracies. In 50 years the Chinese Empire will dominate the world through its vast economic and military might. The free among us must band together, fight tyranny, save the future, and save the world.

Stand up for Freedom,
Stand up for Democracy,
Prepare for Battle
