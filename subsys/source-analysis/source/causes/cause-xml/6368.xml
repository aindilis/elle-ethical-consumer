  <description>Myself along with a loving team are training to participate in the LaSalle Bank Chicago Half and full Marathon as a member of The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training. All of us on Team In Training are raising funds to help stop leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma from taking more lives. I'm completing this event in honor of my dad who is battling A.L.L. Leukemia and all others who suffer from blood cancers. My dad is the real hero on our team, and we need your support to cross the ultimate finish line - a cure!
