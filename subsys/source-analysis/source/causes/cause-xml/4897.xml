Downtown Orlando sucks!!! Crappy music, lame people, nothing interesting going on. How can we change that? Longer drinking hours. This is not just about making it easier for frat boys to get their marks plastered before a semi-conscious romp in the sack. If clubs can make money via later hours &#8211;allowing drinking until 3 a.m., and then letting booze-bags have another hour to sober up &#8211; they&#8217;ll be more apt to bring in better artists. It will reduce the number of DUIs, since drunks won&#8217;t be leaving bars at 1:50 a.m. to grab a six pack at the 7-Eleven before heading home. (Buy it beforehand for the ride home. Duh.)

It&#8217;s past time Orlando started treating its citizens like grown-ups, instead of adolescents in need of a curfew. Besides, wasn&#8217;t Dyer the one mumbling something about a &#8220;24/7&#8221; downtown not too long ago?
