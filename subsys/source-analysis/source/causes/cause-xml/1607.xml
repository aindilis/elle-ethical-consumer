  <description>Our mission is to save the poor squirrel monkeys made slave to the man by being trained to self-inject liquid cocaine. These monkeys, in an experiment to test drug resistance building, were trained to self-inject with aqueous cocaine. They were strapped into plexiglass chairs while world-dampening white noise was played to prevent distraction. During the trials, one monkey became ill and was removed (fate unknown) and at completion the other "participants" were also left by the wayside and their fate is unknown.

1. Force-addicting animals is wrong

2. Cocaine is bad

3. Drug counceling for monkeys is a necessity</description>
