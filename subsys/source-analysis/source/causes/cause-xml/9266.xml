  <description>  more than 734,000 people being arrested on marijuana charges each year. 

According to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), that figure is greater than the combined number of people arrested for violent crimes, including murder, rape and assault.

It is fairly obvious that the jail time and fines resulting from marijuana convictions do not fit the crime, and decriminalization should be considered as a start to eliminating this inequity.



1. If we legalize marijuana, we reduce the black market and the violence associated with the sale of marijuana. 

2. alcohol is much more dangerous than smoking weed..you can die from drinking too much alcohol, but can u die from smoking too much? NO!!! 

3. frequent smokers tend to stay out of trouble. They are more calm and layed back</description>
