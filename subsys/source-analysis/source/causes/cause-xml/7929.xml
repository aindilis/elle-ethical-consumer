  <description>    Alcohol is the drug of choice among youth. Many young people are experiencing the consequences of drinking too much, at too early an age. As a result, underage drinking is a leading public health problem in this country. 

    Each year, approximately 5,000 young people under the age of 21 die as a result of underage drinking; this includes about 1,900 deaths from motor vehicle crashes, 1,600 as a result of homicides, 300 from suicide, as well as hundreds from other injuries such as falls, burns, and drownings (1&#8211;5). 

A major unmet need exists in the treatment of alcohol use disorders: In 2002, 1.4 million youth met the criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence, but only 227,000 actually received any treatment for these problems

Those who start drinking at or before the age of 14 have an extremely high percentage chance of becoming alcohol dependant

Look guys, this cause has a purpose and that is to make this issue aware to everybody. If you disagree...then dont join. I want true to life individuals who care about the wellbeing of the 
generation who will one day lead this world. Thank You For Your Interest In This Cause.
