  <description>Ron Paul is a Republican Congress man from Texas.  Sounds bad I know, but check him out.  He calls himself the biggest supporter of freedom.  He voted against the Iraq War and the Patriot Act.  He believes in not regulating the internet; people should be able to regulate themselves.  He wants America to be smarter with spending and he hopes to relieve some of America's dept, among many other thins.  So give him a chance, he might be just what this country needs.
