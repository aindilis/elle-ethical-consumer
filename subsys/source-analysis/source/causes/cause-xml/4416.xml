  <description>It has been a long dragged out issue between off-road riders and NFS. What has been happening is that some riders feel that it is ok to fumble around with the rules of the off road trails. but what does that do? closes some of the best trails. we belive that if riders and NFS can work together to make both sides happy it will be enjoyable by all.


1. Wildlife saftey.

2. Fire saftet.</description>
