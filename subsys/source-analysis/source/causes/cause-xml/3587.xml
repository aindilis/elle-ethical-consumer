  <description>CI's Vision

We imagine a healthy prosperous world in which societies are forever committed to caring for and valuing nature for the long-term benefit of people and all life on Earth.

Conservation International is committed to helping societies adopt a more sustainable approach to development &#8211; one that considers and values nature at every turn.

Every person on Earth deserves a healthy environment and the fundamental benefits that nature provides. But our planet is experiencing an unprecedented drawdown of these resources, and it is only by protecting nature and its gifts &#8211; a stable climate, fresh water, healthy oceans and reliable food &#8211; that we can ensure a better life for everyone, everywhere.
