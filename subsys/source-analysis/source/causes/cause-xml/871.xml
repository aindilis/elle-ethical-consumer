  <description>I'm tired of watching CNN, NBC, ABC, FOX, and other large news corporations give inaccurate descriptions of stories, "spin" stories, report things i do NOT want to know about, and sell themselves to larger corporations owned by rich, conservative business owners.

1. The following include but are not limited to the names that should never be MENTIONED on any news program: Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Mischa Barton, Nicole Ricci, and Tara Reid.

2. No news organization should be owned by a biased corporation (which means "any corporation") which would try and portray the news inaccurately or downright WRONG.

3. Socks should never be worn with sandals.</description>
