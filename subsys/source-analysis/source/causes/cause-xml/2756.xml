please read!! -&gt; "One of the best donations you can give the SPCA&#8482; is your time. I volunteered at my shelter for years, and I helped rehabilitate and adopt hundreds of animals. It wasn't always easy or pleasant, but it was SO rewarding, and fun too! I don't have a lot of money to donate, and like a lot of people I'm hesitant to donate money to causes because it's not always clear HOW MUCH money is going directly to the cause, but I suggest volunteering, and also donating blankets and toys to a local shelter. It's an easy way to help without necessarily asking for money. There are so many animals (not just dogs and cats) in rows upon rows of cages, just waiting to be loved. Not all can or will be saved, but I know that by volunteering I was able to offer them some comfort while they were there at the shelter." 

Thanks so much for all of you who are donating and supporting the cause!
