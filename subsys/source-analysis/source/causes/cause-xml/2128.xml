  <description>Any future and long term solution to supply energy to the globe's burgeoning population  will have to be met with an investment in renewable energy infrastructure such as wind power, solar power, tidal power, geothermal power and hydropower.  Investment should also focus on the development of non-food crop derived biofuels such as methanol, ethanol, biodiesel, and plant derived oils.  In addition, the construction of sufficiently large renewable energy infrastructure might avoid the economic consequences of an extended period of decline in fossil fuel energy supply per capita. 
To provide this boon, as well as create the tools to use alternative fuels, research must be focused on the development of technology which minimizes environmental impact, while maximizing efficient energy conversion, in the form of fuel, light and mechanical work.



1. Develop renewable energy sources

2. Fuel cell and "all electric" based modes of transportation  

3. LED and organic LED lighting technology

4. Improved energy infrastructure: generation, storage and distribution

5. High temperature superconducting materials</description>
