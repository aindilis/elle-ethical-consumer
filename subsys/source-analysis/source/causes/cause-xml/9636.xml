  <description>There has been a lot of focus on assisting the Zimbabwean children with funds so they can have access to education.  While this is great there seems to be a void in that once they finish high school a lot of them are falling through the cracks, unable to afford post secondery education. 

It is my goal to find a way to assist those brilliant minds in accessing post secondery education.  Once they have completed then it is my hope that they would in turn mentor other youth in similar positions, and assist that youth in gaining their education too.

I do not lie to myself and say I will change the world all at once, however I believe that I can make a difference one person at a time.  As we grow we will then manage to reach a much wider audience and continue on this chain reaction.

1. Everyone deserves an education, even the poor.  It is a universal right.

2. Zimbabwe is facing a crisis at the moment, that does not mean that the dreams, hopes and lives of its people should be ignored and forgotten

3. There should be resources available to poor Zimbabweans who wish to study internationally.</description>
