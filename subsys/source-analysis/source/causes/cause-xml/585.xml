  <description>Unicorns were once a majestic and plentiful animal easily domesticated by virgins. However, due to the value of its horn as a remedy for poison, poachers have reduced the unicorn number to an all time low. If something is not done soon to protect its ever dwindling number, there may one day be no unicorns left at all.

1. Hunting of unicorns must end immediately.

2. Wildlife preserves must be built to protect unicorns.

3. The habitat of the dwindling unicorn population must be protected.</description>
