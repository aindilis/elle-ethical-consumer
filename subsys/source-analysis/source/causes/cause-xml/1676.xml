Rescue and adoption of homeless animals ~ Focus on adoptable pets in Southwest Michigan pounds scheduled for euthanasia.

Rescued animals receive medical treatment like vaccinations, treatment for parasites and spay/neuter procedure. Treatment may also include complex surgeries, heartworm treatment and more.

We find loving "forever homes" for these deserving pets.
