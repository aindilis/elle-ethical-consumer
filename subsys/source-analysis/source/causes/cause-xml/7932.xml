  <description>It&#8217;s not easy to live a life that is glorifying to God. 
It&#8217;s hard to overcome the obstacles we are faced with in our everyday lives.
 
Our prayer is that with Christ's help we can...
Focus on accountability in order to become more like Him,
Live a sacrificial life according to His purpose,
And rely on Him for strength in all things.
