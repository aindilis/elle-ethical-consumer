  <description>I want all of our missions to be to have a part in finishing the Great Commission by making disciples! There are many ways that you can do this: You can simply just stay here in the states and mobilize and make disciples and then send them out to the nations, you can sponsor a native missionary, you can be in prayer for the lost people of this world and form nation prayer groups, you can find ways to hang out with all the thousands of internationals living in your community, or you can actually go to the nations with God's message of forgiveness. I'm sure there are lots of other ways to get involved but in all of these ways, God has a huge purpose in drawing the lost to Himself. Soli Deo Gloria-To God be all the glory!

1. Jesus gives us the command in Matthew 28-18-20 to go make disciples of all nations!

2. Matthew 24:14 says: And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come

3. we have all fallen short of the glory of God, but through God's grace we were bought with a price and now we are His...that should give us a reason to go tell people about God's love and forgiveness!</description>
