  <description>Georgia first experienced the womans touch when she kissed michelle lotz back in yr10. She was in a big drought from kissing girls for a while as she was with many boys but soon she realised that they just didn't compare to women. She finally broke the drought when she passionately locked lips with leah and found that she experienced something long missed. This sparked her surpressed feelings for women and after being rejected by Acko at Venus' &amp; Jo's, she went on a lezzi rampage where she got it on with Lara and Casey on the dance floor all night long!! Besides these random girls that georiga kisses she is also currently married to Kate Grutzner. She hasn't gone back to guys since and the question remains amongst the carey girls, who will be next???
