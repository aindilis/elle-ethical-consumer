  <description>I am involved in a service project with Domestic Violence Services of Greater New Haven to help those women and their children who have been victims of domestic violence. My goal is to get 60 backpacks and fill them with crayons, activity books, blankets, stuffed animals, and other materials that I hope will be little rays of sunshine to keep the children occupied and take their minds off of their fear and sadness.

I am soliciting donations for such materials and it is my hope that you can help me with this project.
