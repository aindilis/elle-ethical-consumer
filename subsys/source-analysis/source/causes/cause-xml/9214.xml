  <description>A cockfight is a blood sport between two specially trained roosters held in a ring called a cockpit. The combatants, known as gamecocks or cocks, are specially bred birds, conditioned for increased stamina and strength. The comb and wattle are cut off in order to facilitate the placement of a hood over the birds' heads to keep them calm prior to the beginning of a fight and to decrease the potential for wounds and bleeding in these fleshy areas. Cocks possess congenital aggression toward all males of the same species, which is amplified through training and conditioning. Wagers are often made on the outcome of the match. While not all fights are to the death, they often may result in the death of both birds. Cockfighting has a very long tradition in North American culture and history. Many of the founding fathers participated in the sport of cockfighting including Washington, Jefferson, MacDonald and Bowell. First the British and then the Irish brought in their favorite breeds of fighting roosters. These breeds make up most of the modern American breeds. With the influx of immigrants from Central America and Asia, they have each added new forms of cockfighting.
