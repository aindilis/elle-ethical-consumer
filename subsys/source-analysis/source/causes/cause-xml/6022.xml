  <description>Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is the number one cause of accidental and intentional poisonings in Canada and the USA.  The danger is in taking more than the recommended dose, or unknowingly taking  other products with acetaminophen.  Unlike smoking, if youtake too much Acetaminophen, in 4 days (or less) you will die, unless you receive a liver transplant.  
We require the Canadian Government change the laws regarding Acetaminophen labelling.  1.  It must clearly state that you MUST NOT take more than the recommended dose as serious illness and or death may result.  2.  All Acetaminophen products must have a clear packaging label/ message (such as a tear away warning) that the product contains Acetaminophen and must not be taken with another product that contains Acetaminpohen as serious illness and or death may result.
We are petitioning the Canadian Government and need your help.  Go to www.ashleylouisecampbell.com and download your own petition for you, your family, friends and community. 
Help us help you!

1. Accidental Acetaminophen poisonings must stop.

2. All Acetaminophen products must have definate warnings and labels.

3. The Canadian Government needs to act and the Public needs to be advised.</description>
