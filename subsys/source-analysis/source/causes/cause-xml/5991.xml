  <description>Each year, hundreds of thousands of baby harp seals are slaughtered on the ice fields off Canada's east coast for their pelts.  Over 95% of the seals killed during this hunt are just days or weeks old.

 

If you were to witness this cruelty personally, your heart would break.  Newborn seals skinned or bled alive ... clubbed to death ... or shot and left wounded to die under the ice.

 

In the past three years, nearly one million baby seals have been clubbed or shot to death. Shockingly, the hunt is subsidized by the Canadian government!

 

Please help us show the Canadian government the rest of the world will no longer stand for this inexcusable and senseless hunt.
