  <description>Important discoveries have been made by our grantees in understanding the nature of threats posed to tigers in their home range, including tiger trafficking and demand for parts from traditional medicines, the effects of logging roads in the Russian Far East, the relationship between coffee and oil palm plantations and tiger distribution in Sumatra and the nature of human tiger conflicts in different landscapes ranging from the grassy Terai Arc to the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans, the steamy jungles of Sumatra and winter snow-covered landscapes of Russia.

*Save The Tiger Fund is actively seeking innovative grant proposals that will help to secure a viable future for Asia&#8217;s wild tigers.
