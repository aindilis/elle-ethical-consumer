  <description>Many alums do not give to their University because they do not believe they can make a difference.  

They can.  Give today.  Even just a $1.  The power of numbers.  Give today.

1. The percentage of the alumni base who gives money influences university rankings

2. The amount of the gift is not important; giving something, anything, annually is.

3. Young alumni of the University of Virginia, please consider giving $15 today to help us move up to #15 ranking from #23</description>
