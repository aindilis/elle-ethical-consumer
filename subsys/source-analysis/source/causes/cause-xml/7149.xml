  <description>I'm hoping that we can inform the world of the undeniable atrocities that have been commited by the Bush white house and maybe force people to finally understand what their tax money is really being used for. Killing People. They are fighting wars for the benefit of the people, a little ironic and hypocritical don't you think?

1. Inform people of the Crimes against Humanity being commited

2. Make people be aware of who they are voting for

3. Confront Bush and put him in the spotlight of murder</description>
  <mission>Hopefully make the world finally acknowledge that money being wasted on killing people could be used to do the complete opposite</mission>
  <name>1 Trillion dollars spent on Weapons last year. Lets use that money to help people, not kill them</name>
