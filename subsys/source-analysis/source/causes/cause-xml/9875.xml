  <description>The Tomorrows Children&#8217;s Fund was founded by a group of dedicated parents to help their children and others like them with cancer and serious blood disorders. With the help of friends like you, today, TCF provides a warm, healthy and loving environment for children in treatment; a full scope of services to relieve families&#8217; emotional and financial stress; the very best possible medical care; and funding for research on these diseases. All of which confirms our belief that through hope, hard work and heartfelt generosity, extraordinary things are possible.

1. Research and cure cancer and serious blood disorders.

2. Comfort kids and families going through treatment.</description>
