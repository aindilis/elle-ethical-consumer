  <description>The Hellenic Ocean Trust has been founded to promote maritime philanthropy and ocean stewardship by ship owners and shipping companies worldwide.

Maritime philanthropy is an emerging field focused on activities benefiting the world&#8217;s oceans and coastal areas.

Examples of maritime philanthropy include addressing marine pollution, preserving ocean habitats for marine life, and monitoring coral reef destruction.

The Hellenic Ocean Trust hopes to create a wide circle of ship owners and shipping companies concerned with the welfare of the oceans that facilitate their business.
