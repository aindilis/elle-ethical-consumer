  <description>For every copy of the Gary Bloom album "Lighting the Dark" sold online by September 1st, $2 will be donated to cancer research.  There are hopes that, when a second Gary Bloom album is released, the same offer will be made.  I am also hoping that other independent musicians will join the cause, so that together, we can try and make a difference.

"Lighting the Dark" can be purchased at &lt;a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/garybloom" target="_blank"&gt;http://cdbaby.com/cd/garybloom&lt;/a&gt; for $9USD

1. It is our responsibility - not a governments - to support cancer research

2. one-time large scale concerts are nice, but let's try something ongoing</description>
