  <description>Please help us in our mission to support our troops who have been deployed outside of the USA.  By sponsoring a care package, it will send a message to these men and women that we support them despite our views on this war.  Each care package consists of items that these soldiers are in need of including deodorant, hand sanitizer, and some food &amp; drink items that will help to give them a taste of home even though they&#8217;re far away.  In addition, we have post cards available for you to fill out and send along with your package so you can leave a message for the soldier you sponsor.  Thank you for playing a part in this worthy cause.

1. Support the US troops deployed overseas and show them how much we love and respect them

2. Send much needed care packages to the deployed troops

3. Show the troops how much we appreciate their fighting efforts to ensure our FREEDOM!</description>
