  <description>It is our belief that the Towel (pronounced T- ow eL)  is the most useful and multi-purposeful tool/weapon that you can find in the universe we live. The Towel was invented many many years before the gun, the knife, the club, the baseball bat, the brass knuckles, the nun chuck, or any other modern day weapon with the exception of the fist. Some scientists beleive that cavemen used their towels to strangle elephants... a feat that would have been much harder to complete without the use of their trustee towel. 

Did you know that for every towel you buy, an old lady escapes from a rapist? Yes its true! 

celebrities have recently begun to wise up to this growing trend, Pictures of celebs are all over the internet of them and their Towels in action
