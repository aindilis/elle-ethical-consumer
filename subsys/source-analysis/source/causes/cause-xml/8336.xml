  <description>African Horse Sickness is a virus that attacks the heart and lungs of horses, mules and donkeys, with a 70 - 90% mortality rate. Each year, hundreds of horses are infected by the disease, which is rapidly spreading throughout South Africa and into other parts of the world. 

With increased general awareness, and steady research into viral treatment, it is possible to curb the infection rate and stop the spread of AHS into "safe area's.' 

* This cause was created in memory in Caegwyn Silver Prince (1990 - 2006)

1. Create awareness of the spread of the virus, and the need to vacinate against it
