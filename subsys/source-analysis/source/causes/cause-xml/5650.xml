  <description>Gainesville Cockatiel Rescue is a nonprofit organization located in Gainesville, FL. We take in birds in need and find them good homes within the community.

1. Birds are highly intelligent and delicate creatures worthy of our care and attention.

2. The only way to make sure birds are taken care of is to educate the community on proper care and maintenance.

3. If you can't stand the poop, get out of the bird room</description>
