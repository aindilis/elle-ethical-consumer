  <description>What is ITP? ITP, immune thrombocytopenia, is classified as an autoimmune disease. In an autoimmune disease the body mounts an attack toward one or more otherwise normal organ systems. In ITP, platelets are the target. They are marked as foreign by the immune system and eliminated in the spleen, or sometimes the liver. 

1. The number of individuals just in the United States with ITP has been estimated to be approximately 200,000.

2. Both children and adults are affected with ITP; ITP can be chronic and acute

3. Donations go to support the efforts of the Platelet Disorder Support Association (PDSA) which provides information, support, and research for ITP.</description>
