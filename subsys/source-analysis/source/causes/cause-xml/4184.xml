  <description> Huntington disease (HD) is an inheritary disorder that affects certain cells in the brain. As the affected brain cells die: body movements, emotions, the thinking process and other perceptions become distorted. It eventually leads to incapacitation and then death. To this date there is no known cure. However, for the first time ever, clinical trials are showing that HD can be reversed. 

Every person with an biological parent that has/had the positive genes has a 50% chance of inheriting HD.

Males and females have the same risk of inheriting HD.

Huntington's Disease affects one in every 1,000 canadians.

One in evry 10,000 candians develops Huntington's Disease.
