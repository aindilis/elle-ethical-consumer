  <description>On October 10, 2007, Ontarians will vote in a referendum to give future generations what we have never had: a truly democratic voting system, where all voters are equal, all votes count, election outcomes are fair and governments represent the majority.

The new system is called Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) representation. It would allow every voter in Ontario two votes: one for a local representative, and one for a party. Local representatives would be elected as they are now, but 39 seats would be used to ensure that each party gets the same percentage of seats as votes. For more information, see http://voteformmp.ca.
