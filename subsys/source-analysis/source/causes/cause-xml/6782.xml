  <description>Here are some facts that can help you move from a non donor to a blood donor: 

4.5 million Americans would die each year without life saving blood transfusions.

Approximately 32,000 pints of blood are used each day in the United States.

Every three seconds someone needs blood.

Just one pint of donated blood can help save as many as three people&#8217;s lives.

Shortages of all types of blood donations occur during the summer and winter holidays.

If all blood donors gave 2 to 4 times a year, it would help prevent blood shortages.
