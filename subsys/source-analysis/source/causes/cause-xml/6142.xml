  <description>The aim of Zye Hooks ministry is to give deliverance to those in need. Zye travels around the nation asking people to give to his ministry which will further his abilities to spread deliverance. He also sells his miracle spring water and cloths to people. Quote from Zye, "haha, those will be gone too because that money is going to my mansion." Cory Higdon and Ben Ogle are junior ministers under the Zye Hook's ministry. DISCLAIMER: So as not to ruin Zye Hooks future career in the field of politics I would like to explain this is a joke and not to be taken seriously. However, you can really allocate funds to Barack Obama through this Cause. Watch this video to get a taste of what Zye Hooks' miracle spring water can do for YOU!!
