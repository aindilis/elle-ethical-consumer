  <description>God has abundantly blessed Living Water International with the opportunity to make a strategic impact across the globe.  At LWI, four principles guide our organization:  honor God, develop people, pursue excellence and be good stewards.

We seek to keep these core values ever before us in all that we do.  Our desire is that every person associated with LWI around the world be committed to these principles.

While physical water is necessary for physical life, the living water of the Spirit of God is necessary for spiritual and eternal life.  Consider the fact that the people who are without access to clean water also live on less than a dollar a day and have had the least exposure to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Think of the hope we can bring by helping people get clean water and sharing the love of God with those who desperately need both.

Our prayer is that God will continue to touch people's hearts to join with us in this high calling to reach the world with water and the Word.

1. Provide teaching.

2. Provide clean water sources.

3. Honor God.</description>
  <mission>demonstrate the love of God by providing desperately needed clean water and medical attention, along with the "living water" of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which alone satisfies the deepest thirst.</mission>
