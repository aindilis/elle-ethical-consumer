  <description>ANYONE WHO HAS ANY RESPECT FOR ANIMALS A site that we were able to shut last year has returned. We are trying to shut it down again! A Japanese man in New York breeds and sells kittens that are called BONSAI CATS. That would sound cute, if it wasn't kittens, days old, that were squeezed into tiny bottles after being given a tranquilizer and then stay there, for the rest of their lives, so that they can be put on a mantelpiece and be poked and laughed at. The cats are fed through a straw and their faces struggle to reach up the neck of the bottle where there is a tiny air hole. They are treated like absolute s***. The skeleton of the kitten will take on the form of the bottle as the kitten grows. The cats never get the opportunity to move apart from the first 
few days they are alive with their mother.   These 'ornaments'are sold cheaply and used as souvenirs. They are the latest trends in New York, China, Indonesia and New Zealand. If your still not convinced PLEASE LOOK ON 
http://www.shorty.com/bonsaikitten/  Please help to stop this sickness.
