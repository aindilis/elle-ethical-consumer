  <description>From July 21-31 a team of over 20 Youth and Leaders from OBCC going to El Salvador on a short term missions trip.  We are going to be working with an orginization called Castillo del Rey (meaning the kings castle). Our team will be reaching out and distributing the Book of Hope to local schools. The Book of Hope provides children with a clear and simple presentation of the Word of God.  We will also be involved in other outreach activities while living in a local church for a portion of our trip.

Each person going on the trip is responsible to raise $1150. If you have any work opprotuinities PLEASE let us know. We are willing to do almost anything to work our way to our goal, or more.

*****MOST IMPORTANTLY*****
We ask for your prayers while we prepare to go on this trip, as well as while we are there.  We hope that God will use us in amazing ways while we are there to touch many lives.

1. God's Word needs to be shared

2. Help others in need.

3. Show others that God will impact your life.</description>
