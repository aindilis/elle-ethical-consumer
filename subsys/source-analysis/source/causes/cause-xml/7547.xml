  <description>"Bring Back Fistwaving" is a non-profit organization that seeks to remind society of the benefits of this ancient tradition - and more importantly: the cost of its impending extinction from the social apparatus.

In a world where swearing, finger pointing (sometimes accompanied by gurning!), shouting without a relevant gesture, are commonplace, it's no wonder society is in decay.

Just think, when was the last time you got angry, and simply shook a fist, and smiled...

We feel that if we can revive this tried and tested method of interpersonal discontent, we can make a lasting difference to the planet, each and every one of us.

Start today. Wave that fist and smile.


1. Pointing is rude, aggressive, provocative. End it now

2. Fingerwagging was but a trend in the 90s

3. Fistwaving is a noble tradition we should cherish</description>
