  <description>The WWE Diva Search is now in the process of starting its fourth campaign on WWE television. Our slogan: "When the Diva Search begins, TURN AROUND or TURN IT OFF." At this point, at live events, people will face away from the ring or the TitanTron, and at home, people will turn the channel for 10 minutes or so. Shirts might be made for this grassroots cause.

1. The WWE Diva Search is a waste of time and $250,000

2. The segments on WWE television accomplish the incredible feat of making viewers sick and bored of watching hot women on their TV screens

3. Joining us in ending this nonsense will give either Coach or The Miz less TV time and exposure, which is a very good idea.</description>
