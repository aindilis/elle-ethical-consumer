  <description>Why do people protect illegal immigrants? They live here and dont pay taxes. They are taking every right away from you. They use your tax money through wellfare, people you are paying for other people to live, that is stealing your money, that is stealing your freedomPeople your democrat leaders are lying and decieving you. I urge you, for your own good, to help deport illegal immigrants, not just the mexicans,  but all races and peoples who come here illegally. 

1. Sheltering of Illegal immigrants must stop now

2. Police should crack down on illegal immigrants

3. The government should do whatever they can to stop illegal immigration</description>
