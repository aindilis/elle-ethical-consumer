  <description>San Diego Coastkeeper is a locally-based non-profit organization and is San Diego&#8217;s official agency of the international Waterkeeper Alliance, which works to protect the world&#8217;s waterways.

The organization was launched in 1995, as San Diego Baykeeper, to combat chronic pollution of the San Diego Bay that transformed a once-thriving ecosystem into a highly toxic waterbody. A local, community-based advocacy group, Baykeeper became the 15th approved Waterkeeper program in the country.

After 10 years of successfully fighting pollution of San Diego&#8217;s waterways, San Diego Baykeeper became San Diego Coastkeeper in 2005 - a new name for a growing organization whose mission now encompasses protecting all of San Diego County&#8217;s bays, beaches, watersheds and ocean.
