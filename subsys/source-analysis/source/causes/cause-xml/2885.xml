  <description>Sourashtrian people are a different race of south asains. Though they are indian and Gujarati based, they are a minority themselves in India. Many of them are poor. We will like to help them in any way we can by donating money. Many need education, and becuase children are our future, we would like to assure that every sourashtrian child gets an education.
