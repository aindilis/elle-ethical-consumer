  <description>With the support of World Vision, Christian college students have formed a network of Acting on AIDS chapters.

Our goal is to create a movement, not merely an organization or club, that encourages a campus-wide movement that leads individuals to a lifestyle of activism. This movement consists of a growing network of chapters (more than 100 to date) &#8211; as either an independent campus chapter, part of an existing campus ministry, or as a church ministry. Chapters work together to create awareness and promote activism through education, political advocacy, fundraising, and local service. This is something you can to here and now, on your campus, in your community, with limited resources.
