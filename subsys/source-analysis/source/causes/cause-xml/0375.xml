Our Values:

&#187; Impartial : We provide aid and assistance to those in need irrespective of race, religion or politics

&#187; Efficient : We achieve a massive return on donations by exploiting a pool of expert volunteers, global sourcing resulting in the majority of funds going directly to field projects

&#187; Collaborative : We work with local authorities and other NGOs in a spirit of partnership to achieve the best outcomes

&#187; Global and Local : We combine global expertise and resources with local knowledge of needs and culture to maximise the impact of our work

&#187; Empowerment : We aim to empower communities to get back on their feet, heal rifts and to become independent
