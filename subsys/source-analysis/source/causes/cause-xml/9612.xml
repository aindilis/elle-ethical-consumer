  <description>Many people who are concerned about the state of Muslim-Jewish relations ask us what they can do to make a difference.  

You are the answer.  Join this historic effort to reconnect ancient cousins.  In recent times, millions of bonds have been broken between individual Jews and individual Muslims

Is it true that most Muslims from Indonesia to Iran, from Lebanon to Libya, from Syria to Sudan, don't like Jews?

Is it true that Jews in London, Paris, Moscow, Montreal, Buenos Aires, Jerusalem and New York don't like Muslims?

Is there a unique problem to be addressed in the global relationship between Jews and Muslims?

The only way we can find out is by talking to each other directly.





1. Muslims and Jews have core similarities that can help us re-build mutual respect

2. Differences over political issues characterize many friendships and family relationships.  There is no reason for political differences between Muslims and Jews to prevent us from getting to know each other as individuals.

3. A global Muslim-Jewish dialogue movement can play a significant role in the reduction of violence between our two peoples and around the world. </description>
