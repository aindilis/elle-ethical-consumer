  <description>To anyone that has a few words to say in apreciation for one of the greatest hospitals in the world.  

Please share your stories of how this amazing hospital has helped you or a loved one.

Our own daughter is a patient of Great Ormond Street Hospital having being born with a rare condition affecting 1 in every 100,000 being born with this condition.  Her condition is called Fibula Hemimelia which means she was born without her Fibula bone in her right leg, she also has no outside ankle joint and only 4 toes with three of them webbed.  She is also missing 2 of her ligaments in her knee.  Her right leg is at the moment 4cm shorter than her left leg and gets around with raised shoes from the heel.  As Amy gets older her leg will contine to shorten and at the age of about 7 she will have to have a operation to lengthen her Tibia bone.  This operation will again be repeated at the age of 14.  

Amy already has had a operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital when she was 18 months old to relese the tendons in her heel to enable her foot to point normally and flat as when she was born it pointed downwards and she used to walk on the fronts of her toes.  


I sucessfully completed the Great North Run 2007 with a time of 03.06.28 which I was really chuffed with as it was my first ever run.

With alot of help from some very generous people I raised aprox &#163;1,200.
