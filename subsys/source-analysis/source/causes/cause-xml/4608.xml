  <description>If we don't do something right now, our planet will eventually become corrupt. There will be no more environment for us to destroy. No more species to endanger. No more water to pollute. You might think that's far-fetched but it's happening right now. The car you or your parents drive to the plaza 2 minutes away from your garage. The ziploc bag you throw after you finish your lunch. There are just too many to name. So save our Earth, because there might not be one later.

1. Reduce garbage. Reduce energy use.

2. Recycle anything recyclable.

3. Reuse anything reusable.</description>
