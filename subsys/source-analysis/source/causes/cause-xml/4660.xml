  <description>This Cause is to gather all the armenians and any other nationalties in order to represent a united front against the injustice. We are going to rewrite the history. We can do it if we are together. We need to fight so the 1915 Genocide won't be repeated or murders like the one of Hrant Dink will not take place. To do this we need the Diaspora to send more help back home and rebuild our country. Diaspora needs to act. Through this cause we can donate money diectly to the Armenian Fund, which is a legal organization, so the money won't be going into no one's pocket, but will be used to support our home:Armenia. 

1. Armenia and Karabakh need the diaspora.

2. With the help of Diaspora Armenia can stand against its regional enemies.

3. The People of Our Country need our actions. ACT!!NOW!!</description>
