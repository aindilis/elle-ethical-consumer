  <description>Literally, DIY means "Do It Yourself". This definition can be applied to anything in life. Whether it be DIY punk ethics in culture, creating a garden, fixing your car on your own, supporting independent outlets in society (grocery stores, record stores, health clinics, etc.), and many other facets of society. 

DIY supporters define DIY within their own lives and take it as far as their convictions drive them. DIY supporters believe in "Doing It Yourself" rather than paying someone to do it for you. 

Wikipedia provides general definitions that further elaborate on DIY.
