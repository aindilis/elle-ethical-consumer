  <description>Dance Marathon is a 25 hour event in which we raise money for the Childrens Miracle Network. The dancers of the event have many things to do through out the night including watching musicians, dancers, or comedians, or enjoy bouncehouses, bull riding, laser tag, and many other things to pass the time.

We do this for one reason; For The Kids!

1. Raising money for the Miami Childrens Hospital.</description>
