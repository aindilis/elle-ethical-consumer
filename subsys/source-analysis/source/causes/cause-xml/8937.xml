  <description>Brought to life by actress Stefanie Powers in memory of Oscar-winning actor William Holden, this Wildlife Foundation on the slopes of Mount Kenya encourages Kenyan students through residential education programmes to preserve the wildlife of their unique country. 

The Foundation works closely with the Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy's Animal Orphanage on the rehabilitation of abandoned and sick animals into the wild giving students an otherwise unattainable insight into the life of such rare species as the Mountain Bongo and the White Zebra.
