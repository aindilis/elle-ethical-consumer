  <description>Razzles is determined to turn this country around. In a time of great importance for this country, it is important that we elect a candidate with an unconditional love for America. Razzles, being a black, a woman, and a dog, wants to make sure that prejudice towards all three groups. With determination and commitment, as well as dog-years of experience in politics and policy, it is clear that Razzles, more than anyone else should be the leader of our country at this time of great struggle.

2. We must stop prejudice towards dogs.

3. We must see the War on Terra to an end.

4. Cut taxes.

5. Out-minority both Clinton and Obama.</description>
