  <description>Are you tied of people asking you if there are malls in Africa!?

Of people asking you if the are white people in Africa?

Has someone asked you if you know Simba?

Are you sick of people asking you if have ridden an elephant/lion/rhino/hyena to school?

Do you wish that Africa would get more recognition for its achievements and not ONLY its problems?

Do you wish that the only reason people talk about Africa wasn't because a celebrity adopted a child there??

Do you wonder why only animals or poverty or desease are the only things that make it on Western TVs about Africa?

1. Africa will raise  . . . 

2. Africa is not a banch of black naked villagers.

3. Africa is as diverse both in calture and ecomony as the US is to South America. Because it has different countries!

4. Stop the ignorance and the bias World Trade Organisation from exploiting Africa.

5. Most importantly, Africa is a continent -not one giant country like most people here belive.</description>
