  <description>Just as the mission says.  We are all rallying to bring down the tyrannical rule of Microsoft over the market of Operating Systems.  We don't really care what you support as long as it is not Microsoft.  Be it Mac, Linux, FreeBSD, or other OS, we want you to make the switch today!

1. Microsoft has too much control over the OS market which causes shotty/lazy/inadequate programming and causes problems.  Example: Windows Vista, probably one of the worst operating systems to date released from Microsoft.  They just don't care any more

2. Switch to Linux or Mac.  We don't care which one you go to just go with one of them.  If you want more support, go with Mac.  If you want to fix problems yourself, linux or FreeBSD.  Just do it now.  Fight the power (of microsoft)

3. purchase non-microsoft containing/supporting products..I don't mean that you can't buy computer parts, just don't buy a computer that has windows installed on it...or worse yet, buying the discs...that is cause for lynchings</description>
