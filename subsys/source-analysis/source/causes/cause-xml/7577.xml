  <description>Little Elm Friends of the Library started out as the Little Elm Community Library about 12 years ago when the library was based in the high school.  When room was made at the new town hall for the library, the town started managing the library and we became the Friends with a primary goal of raising funds and volunteering.  Our major fundraiser every year is the Trivia event, in which an impressive number of the town's citizens and business participate.  In recent years, we have purchased for the library:
&gt; Thousands of dollars in reference books
&gt; Furniture
&gt; Optical scanner for the sight impaired
&gt; Storage cabinets
&gt; Computers (through donations and grants)
&gt; Bronze sculptures
&gt; Audio Books
&gt; Website services (JobView, Legal Forms, Small Business Resources)
We are also building a fund to assist in furnishing and equipping the upcoming new library facilities expected within the next few years.
