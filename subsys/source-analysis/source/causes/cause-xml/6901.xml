  <description>This group is for all those Springfieldians who are fed up with our six-term mayor:

The illiterate, tax-cheating, wife-swapping, pot-smoking,
"spendocrat" Diamond Joe Quimby Quimby! 

Now, why are we doomed to this Quimby Quagmire, you ask, oh reasonable facebook fan? Because this town is under the stranglehold of a few tie-dyed tree-huggers who would rather play hackeysack than lock up the homeless.


We need fresh leadership from someone who can bring the public back to the Republican party. It's high time people realized we conservatives aren't all Johnny Hatemongers, Charlie Bible Thumps, or even -- God forbid --George Bushes.
