  <description>This is an injury caused at birth and becoming way to common and needs to be stoped. In the niagara Region alone there is over 30 cases and all done by the same doctor.

Do all the children need to walk around with one side of thier body disabled for the rest of thier life. This is not fair to any of these children and the public has the right to know about this injury that has become so common now.
