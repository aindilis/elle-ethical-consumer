  <description>Abortion ,also known as the silent holocaust, has ended the lives of almost 40 million unborn babies since it was made legal in 1973 by the supreme court decision Roe v. Wade. Worldwide, an estimated 46 million babies are aborted each year. Instead of trying to end the death penalty why not end the killings of innocent children who cannot fend for themselves. We are the voices of those who cannot speak for themselves.

1. overturn the supreme court decision Roe v. Wade

2. act as voices for the unborn.

3. Abortion = Murder</description>
