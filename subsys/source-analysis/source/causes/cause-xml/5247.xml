  <description>The Educational Theatre Association and its International Thespian Society branch have been working since 1929 to honor excellence among students of theatre and support the work of theatre educators. Originally focused on theatre in high schools, EdTA has in recent years broadened the scope of its mission to embrace the concept of theatre as an instrument of lifelong learning and has expanded its membership to include students and teachers in middle schools, and college students preparing for careers in theatre education.

You can find the Junior Thespians, ITS, and EdTA online at http://www.edta.org.

Past, current, and future members of Junior Thespians (Middle School), International Thespians Society (High School), or the Educational Theatre Association(Professional) are welcome to join and invite their fellow thespians!
