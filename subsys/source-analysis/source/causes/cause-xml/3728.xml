  <description>I'm more attached to the environment than to my hamburgers so I refrain from eating beef for the following reasons:

"The Union of Concerned Scientists says there are two things people can do to most help the environment. The first is to drive a fuel-efficient automobile (that means, not an SUV or a truck) and live near where we work. The second is to not eat beef. "

"for every pound of beef I did not eat, I would save anywhere from 2,500 to 5,000 gallons of water"

"Every second of every day, one football field of tropical rainforest is destroyed in order to produce 257 hamburgers."

"they are fed huge amounts of antibiotics. It is now conceded that the antibiotics fed to cattle are the main cause of antibiotic resistance in people"

annnnnd on top of that cows are fed vast amounts of corn (the corn that is fed to one cow could feed 10 people), they produce tons of polluting wastes, deplete grasslands (when they are grazed as oposed to feedlots), and they produce methane witch is a major greenhouse gass contributing to global warming.

so... get a crispy chicken sandwitch next time...

and if you can eat "free-range" meat to avoid cruelty to animals.

fyi all the donations for this cause go to mercy corps

1. we should replace beef with other meats or veggies

2. the food we eat should be raised/grown in a sustainable way

3. overcrowded feedlots are detrimental to the environment and cruel</description>
