  <description>Have you ever heard adenocarcinoma of the esophagus? How about Barret's esophagus or squamous cell cancer.  Cancer can strike any part of anybody we love suddenly and brings despair and pain to victims and their families.  Estimated new cases in 2007 can reach 17 000 in the United states and 13 500 of them do not survive, it is a cancer on the rise reaching a shocking 300 % rise in the past two years.  The youngest case I have heard is a 17 year old girl in the late stages of this cancer. Where does this come from? How can we prevent it? Here are some of the signs and we can help you if you know anybody that has any concerns. I also hope to hear some stories from some...anyone and I especially encourage success stories that will help those diagnosed and caregivers/family/friends to keep the hope alive.

1. More research time and money need to go into finding out more to help victims of EC

2. Hope for the future.  Even if this cancer runs in your family I will give you all the information I know to help

3. To honour those that we have lost like my father the late Kevin Hughes to EC December 16/2006 at the age of 49. Let their deaths not be in vain...and </description>
