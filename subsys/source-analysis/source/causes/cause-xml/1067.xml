  <description>Marine Animal Rescue Program (MARP). MARP's primary function is to rescue stranded marine animals in emergency situations, provide extensive rehabilitation and, if possible, release the animals back into the wild. To date, the program has rescued 49 pinnipeds (seals, walruses, and sea lions), 29 sea turtles, 31 cetaceans, and one Florida manatee. MARP has been able to successfully return 28 of these animals back into the wild. 

Captive Breeding Programs: Captive breeding programs such as these help protect threatened species and eliminate some of the need to collect wild specimens. Sixteen species of rain forest birds have been successfully bred at the Aquarium. We were also the first US zoo or aquarium to breed the rare blue poison dart frog (Dendrobates azureus).
