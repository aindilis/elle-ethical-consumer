  <description>The African Children&#8217;s Choir&#8482; features delightful African children ages 7 through 11. Many have lost one or both parents through the devastation of war, famine and disease. Their voices sing out on behalf of Africa&#8217;s 12 million AIDS orphans. They represent the future of the entire continent, demonstrating the potential to become strong leaders for a better future in their homeland.

In spite of the tragedy that has marred their young lives, these musically gifted children are radiant with hope and wonderfully entertaining. They melt the hearts of audiences with their charming smiles and joyful African melodies and dance.

The primary goal of the African Children&#8217;s Choir&#8482; is to raise awareness of the need of destitute and orphaned children in Africa and to raise funds for continued development and support of the Choir&#8217;s relief and development programs. Once Choir members have completed a concert tour, they will return to their homelands with the support, care and education necessary for bettering their future and that of their brothers and sisters.

They are Africa&#8217;s future.
