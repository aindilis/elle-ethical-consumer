  <description>There are many skilled and creative young people in this city who lack place/space to express themselves, and so i figure that we could make a change and raise money so we could finance equipment that is needed to start this art revolution in Stavanger.
If youre an art lover, support this cause either with money or by helping getting new legal spots for the youth so they can express themselves freely.
Equipment will me handed out by myself for the artists that want to contribute and make this city a real cultural city of 2008.
Without art, Kulturbyen Stavanger 2008 is just a empty name.


1. This is cause is positive in many ways, keeping youth busy and creative

2. Making art avalable for everyone and anyone</description>
