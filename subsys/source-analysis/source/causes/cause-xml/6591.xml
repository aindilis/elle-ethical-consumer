  <description>Through the Eyes of Hope Project was created by photographer Linda Smith in 2007 after she traveled to Rwanda and witnessed the fascination that children in different orphanages had with her photography. The two main goals are to teach basic photography to disadvantaged children and to educate others interested in the culture of different children. The program locally houses projects to teach children in the Bronx and Bedford about those orphaned by AIDs and child soldiers Rwanda and Uganda. This August, Linda plans to return with two others to work at the Partners in Health Hospital in Rwinkwavue, the Millenium Village Projects in Mayange, and the Kagugu school in Kigali. 


Donations made will go to fund the trip and the cameras purchased for the children. 

1. Providing an expressive outlet for children to tell their story.

2. Celebrating the creativity by exhibiting their photography in varying venues.

3. To create a cross cultural program for children and raise awareness. </description>
