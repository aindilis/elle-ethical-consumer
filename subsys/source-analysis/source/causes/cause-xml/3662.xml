  <description>Incorporated January 10, 1990, KSDS was the first program in the 70-year history of guide dogs in America and the 30-year history of service dogs to provide both of these types of canine assistance from within the same facility.

KSDS assistance dog &#8220;teams&#8221; consist of the highly-trained dog and the person who is visually impaired or physically disabled. The cost for each team placement is estimated at $15,000. Today KSDS has working teams in 30 states and puppy raisers in 10 states.

KSDS has provided people with disabilities more than $4 million in product and services since November of 1991. As a non-profit organization, KSDS prides itself that 96 cents of every dollar donated goes toward placing assistance dogs.
