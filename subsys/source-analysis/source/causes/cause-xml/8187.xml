  <description>The Laare Community Technology Centre was founded by Eric Mibuari, a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with the assistance of MIT&#8217;s Public Service Center.  The aim of this community centre is to increase general computer awareness and literacy in the Laare community by providing cheap, local and accessible training on the use of computers.

At present the centre particularly targets the youth and seeks to equip them with basic computing skills that they can apply for personal use, in industry and in education. The centre was started in January 2005 and has so far offered various levels of training to more than a hundred students. The centre takes particular note of the economic difficulties of the many people who would like to benefit from its training and facilities and purposely strives to charge the minimal feasible fees.

With your help, we can provide more computers, more consistent electricity, and a better working environment in general to the students of the Centre. The people of Laare thank you in advance! :)

1. Access to technology opens doors for the future of the youth of Laare.

2. Access to technology will improve the living conditions of the Laare community and surrounding areas, by educating the people and giving hope for the future.</description>
