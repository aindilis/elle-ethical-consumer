  <description>At Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Edmonton, we concentrate on kids.    We recognize that every young person has the ability and potential to fulfill their wants and dreams, however, many kids do not see this potential in themselves.  Environments of mistrust, abuse, and poverty are a reality for many kids today.  That&#8217;s why Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Edmonton is so important.  We have been providing children and youth with valuable services that encourage a healthy and self-supported life style since 1962.  

 

Currently Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Edmonton operates six full time and three part time Youth &amp; Neighbourhood Centres in Edmonton.  These Centre's service over 5000 young people each year.  Many kids rely on our Centres as a safe place if they are in trouble, a place where they can eat a nutritious meal, and a place where they can just be comfortable being a kid, make friends, and have fun.  

 

Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Edmonton involve kids in activities that stimulate and challenge their minds, body, and spirit.  We encourage and motivate them to do their best in all that they do, by providing positive role models amongst our staff and volunteers.  Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Edmonton provides an atmosphere for young people that leads them towards a more independent, gratifying, and fruitful life.
