  <description>The Emergent Leadership Institute(ELI) engages Indianapolis area young people in becoming stakeholders in our community through www.helpindyonline.com(HIO) and our Community Access Points (CAPs) programs. HIO is an online volunteer center designed specifically for the needs of Indianapolis area young people. Students can find hundreds of volunteer positions from over 100 local non-profit organizations. Our CAPs program is designed for ELI to be a catalyst for introducing students to our partnering agencies in real life settings. This can be done at a school, through another youth serving organization or through ELI staff co-creating volunteer opps with students and educators.
