A poem for Mrs. Carey-Bianco&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

"I&#8217;m sending this to let you know
I think of you each day,
And pray for your recovery,
Hoping soon you&#8217;ll be okay.

You&#8217;re going through a lot right now;
You&#8217;re treatments can be trying;
Remember while you do them
It&#8217;s your problem you&#8217;re defying.

Hold on to your positive attitude,
And when things get hard to bear,
Know that I am here for you;
Remember that I care.

And when you&#8217;re well and flourishing,
Look back and realize,
You learned what you were made of;
That&#8217;s a reward that satisfies!

I believe in you; You can do it!" (http://www.poemsource.com/get-well-poems.html)
