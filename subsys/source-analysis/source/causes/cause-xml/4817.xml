  <description>TWLOHA Has been going through some changes, one of which is the fact that the organization is no longer a part of Fireproof Ministries.  As such this facebook cause's donations do not reach the actual cause.  

As I, Jonathan White, am pursuing other interests, I no longer work for TWLOHA, so if you have questions or comments, please email:

info@twloha.com

Thanks.  

1. Love is the movement.

2. Rescue is possible.

3. We can be rescued, and we are called to be rescuers.</description>
