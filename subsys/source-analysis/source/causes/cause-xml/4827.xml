  <description>Anxiety disorders are the most common of all mental health problems, affecting approximately one in 10 people. Characterized by intense, prolonged bouts of distress or fear, anxiety disorders are more common in women than in men, and are often accompanied by other symptoms such as depression, substance abuse, or physical problems.

This problem usually gets overlooked mainly because people dont understand it and it is one of the hardest thing to explain (a panic attack that is) 

I am starting this Group because I wish to raise awareness.  It is time that people understand what we 750,000 Canadians are going through!

1. Anxiety is a terrifying and diabilitating disease.

2. Panic attacks can lead to drugs, alcohol, depression and suicide</description>
