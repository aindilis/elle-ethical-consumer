  <description>Join Project Tomorrow at www.projecttomorrow.org/membership

Project Tomorrow is an organization, lead by a group of young social entrepreneurs, who are creating an interactive online community where members don&#8217;t just hear about the impact community build projects are having on the lives and communities where they take place, they become part of shaping the story. 

Members (aka: Agents) will meet the people impacted, watch the projects as they happen, communicate with those on the ground and vote; making decisions about how resources are best used for maximum impact.

1. We let you engage in the giving process by voting where the money goes and how it is spent.

2. We believe in sustainablility which is reflecting in our projects and our organizational structure.

3. We partner with organizations all over the world, leverging resources to the max, to create sustainable change around the globe.</description>
