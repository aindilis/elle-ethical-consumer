Please go to the website above or stop by the Petsmart at Haldeman and Roosevelt Boulevard and see our cats and kittens up for adoption...save a life!

1. Feral (wild) cats must be spayed and neutered to decrease overpopulation.

2. We are very small and do not have a shelter but our cats and kittens are placed in foster homes. 

3. These cats and kittens receive medical attention with the help of local veterinarians, and when ready, they are put up for adoption.</description>
