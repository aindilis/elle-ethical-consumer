  <description>The newfoundland seal hunt, to many, a brutal slaughter of helpless baby animals, in reality a sustainable, humane hunt that has been occuring almost annually for centuries. In the past 40 years oppositon has grown to the hunt, mostly outside of newfoundland, and even outside Canada, in what appears to be mostly urban areas. The animal rights groups, which oppose this hunt spread fallacies about the hunt and easily manipulate, again, urban people and in turn they spread their cause around spitting out the same lies that were told to them. Its somewhat funny seeing how passionate these people can get, yet they nothing of what they speak.

This Cause is to support the seal hunt as sustainable, humane and ecologically necessary, and to oppose those who spread lies and propaganda about it.

1. Support the Seal Hunt
