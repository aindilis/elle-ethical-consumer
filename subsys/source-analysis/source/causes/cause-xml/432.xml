  <description>TISL is a forum for the top echelon of campus leaders and political science students to consider top state, federal and local issues during an annual legislative session at the State Capitol.

College students created TISL in 1966 to give themselves a voice and a role in state government.

Every college and university in Tennessee is eligible to join.

State laws adding a student to the Tennessee Board of Regents and the University of Tennessee Board of Trustees originated in TISL. The TISL General Assembly voted for mandatory child safety seats and the Governor's Schools before the Tennessee General Assembly did the same.

Joining this cause or making a donation, however small it might be, helps show that Tennessee college students are committed to playing a role and making a difference.

1. College students should have a voice that is heard!
