  <description>The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research today announced that it has awarded $1 million in supplemental funding to five investigators to push forward promising results of work funded under the Foundation's Community Fast Track  2005 program.

"Community Fast Track allows the Foundation to quickly and effectively vet 'out-of-the-box' strategies for improving the treatment or diagnosis of Parkinson's disease," said Sarah Orsay, the Foundation's CEO. "The program was designed to serve some of MJFF's most deeply held values: the exploration of promising but untested approaches to Parkinson's disease, our emphasis on accountability, and our commitment to keeping promising science moving forward quickly."
