  <description>We are designed to wake people up to what our government plans do with us sheeple. The "Real Id Act" was passed a couple of years ago in a defense spending bill for our soldiers overseas. Its plan is to make every US citizen accept the National Identification Card. It will replace your State Driver's license. It is planned to be implemented in May of 2008. This Id Card will also come with an RFID chip. For those of you who don't know what that is, it is a Radio Frequency Chip that will allow the government to track you anywhere and everywhere. Their plan as stated in the Project for a New American Century and other documents written by the Council on Foreign Relations, is to, by the year 2010, make the card the only means of transportation, buying any commercial goods, etc. You may think this is far fetched, but it has been layed out by our government. I suggest everyone who joins this cause to do the research and determine how much of a privacy violation and freedom impediment this is.
