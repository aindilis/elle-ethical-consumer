  <description>In Ecuador, there is a hospital, Damien House, to help those with Hansen's Disease. Your donation and awareness helps those with this disease, more commonly known as leprosy.

2. Damien House treats about 760 people with Hansen's disease or leprosy.

3. People who are ill deserve to be treated with dignity.</description>
