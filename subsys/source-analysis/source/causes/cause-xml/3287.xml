  <description>The National Peace Corps Association -- the nation's leading nonprofit organization supporting supporting Returned Peace Corps Volunteers and the Peace Corps community -- is honored to play a significant role in the 50th Anniversary of the Peace Corps. This milestone celebrates the Peace Corps community&#8217;s accomplishments and gives us all an opportunity to reflect on how each one of us can continue to exemplify the Peace Corps mission and spirit.
