  <description>So many times people say that abortion is wrong, but the war is right.  Or the war is wrong, but euthanasia is fine.  Or Euthanasia is wrong, but the death penalty is good. 

Members of ProLifeProChrist actively seek out the best ways to live out the gospel in a world desperate for Christ's followers to be salt and light. ProLifeProChrist seeks to end the murder of the unborn, relieve the poverty related to abortion, and help in all other related fields. Besides focusing on all issues related to the sanctitiy of life, ProLifeProChrist focuses on the eternal aspects of life. God has set up a reality in which humans live forever and find joy in living for Him. Because of this, members of ProLifeProChrist desire to encourage one another in surrendering to God's will. Lastly, ProLifeProChrist proudly bears the name of our Savior Christ Jesus, Who came into the world to save sinners and give them abundant life. With Christ as our banner, we resolve to show His love to the world.

1. Life is precious at all levels and humans deserve life.

2. The love of Christ is needed in the world we live in.

3. Abortion, euthanasia, the death penalty, etc. must end now.</description>
