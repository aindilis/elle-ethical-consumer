Mercy Corps works amid disasters, conflicts, chronic poverty and instability to unleash the potential of people who can win against nearly impossible odds. Their relief-to-recovery program has reached more than 450,000 Lebanese in nearly 200 villages by providing food, blankets and other essential humanitarian items; improving access to drinking water and sanitation; rebuilding schools, parks and playgrounds; providing vouchers to farmers; and programming activities for youth. These efforts make up the bulk of Mercy Corps' $13.2 million Emergency Response and Recovery in Lebanon program, which is expected to reach 700,000 people by July 2007.

All donations go to Mercy Corps. For more information, visit them online at http://www.mercycorps.org/
