Our goal is to bring back the old jeeps, not these crappy chrysler ones with weak metal and mini-van engines(V-6). Bring back the CJ,XJ,YJ,MA, or EVen the TJ!Bring back the 4.0 or 4.2 Liter Inline 6's. The older jeeps also looked alot Cooler then the dumb new model JK!

1. The V-6 is horrible

2. The shaping is horrible

3. The way its build is horrible</description>
