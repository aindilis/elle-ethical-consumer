  <description>Our Values

Poverty Matters: Because our choices have the power to both negatively and positively impact our global neighbors, we must be proactive in addressing global poverty

Relationship Matters: It is neither adequate nor effective enough to simply deliver aid; it is imperative to enter into a relationship with those we are serving and those who serve us

Justice Matters: That much of the world&#8217;s resources are consumed by a few while the rest of the world struggles for daily survival is an injustice that can and must be corrected

Community Matters: Globalization and communication technologies provide the opportunity for unprecedented interconnectedness and interdependence with the poor and marginalized

Through our partner organizations, we actively support:

    * - 4,000 young students with a meal and an education
    * - 1,400 orphaned children with a loving and caring home environment
    * - 102 young girls at risk because of their involvement in the commercial sex trade are given a chance to earn income in a dignified and healthy way
    * - 500 small businesses with critical financial services so that they can continue and expand their life's work
    * - 425 individuals living with HIV/AIDS by providing home based care and assistance along with vocational training
