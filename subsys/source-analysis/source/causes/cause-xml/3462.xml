  <description>As those of us who spend significant time around Colin have come to realize, he has turned into a manic depressive (and often frightningly angry) shell of a human being.  He needs medical help, but will never do so willingly and will just make fun of Zach if the topic is brought up. Please donate money so we can get our friend back.

2. Final Fantasy VII is not your real life

3. Everything is not Zach's fault

4. Longboarding can not be a career
