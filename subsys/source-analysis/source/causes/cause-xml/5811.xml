  <description>Remedy is what its name states... a cure a solution to a problem. Africa is in desperate need of a remedy. Too many people have suffered and too many have died.. I can't sit here any longer watching it happen so Remedy will be the change i want to see in this world

1. Africa is in desperate need of a remedy

2. We as humans not as Americans have an obligation to do everything possible to help anyone in need

3. Unnecessary death and starvation can be stopped</description>
