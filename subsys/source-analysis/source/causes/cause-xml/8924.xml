  <description>Baltimore College Debate attempts to bring the educational and social benefits of college debate to students graduating from and attending school in Baltimore City. We provide several programs including competitive debate during the school year, public debate and independent media all year long, a summer long bridge program that helps students cross the gap between high school and college, and eventually a students employment and mentor program.

1. College education should be available to all students

2. Public debate should be a key component of the political process

3. Every person can grow from debate

4. Students should have media they can use and create</description>
