  <description>The Campus Climate Challenge is a project of more than 30 leading youth organizations throughout the U.S. and Canada. The Challenge leverages the power of young people to organize on college campuses and high schools across Canada and the U.S. to win 100% Clean Energy policies at their schools. The Challenge is growing a generation-wide movement to stop global warming, by reducing the pollution from our high schools and colleges down to zero, and leading our society to a clean energy future.

1. To stop global warming, we must fight for a more just and sustainable world. 

2. We are youth united for a clean energy future.

3. Campuses can be the models for a carbon-neutral world. </description>
