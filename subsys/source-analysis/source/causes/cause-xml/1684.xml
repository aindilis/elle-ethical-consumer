  <description>Progressive Maryland, Maryland's largest grassroots organization is working on the clean money campaign to end corporate influence in Maryland politics. The current setup allows candidates to take money from special interest groups or big companies, like Pepco or Comcast, when they run for office. However when that candidate wins and is in office, they are usually obligated to vote in favor of these companies and special interest groups. This Clean Money Campaign allows candidates to refuse money from those companies and be funded by the state. This allows the candidate to work solely for their constituents.

This campaign passed in our House of Delegates and unfortunately lost in our State Senate by one vote! So if you feel strongly about this issue join Progressive Maryland so that our representatives will see how serious their voters are about getting this legislation passed. 

1. Public funding of candidates takes the pressure off our representatives to favor any company.

2. Every Marylander's vote should mean something and not be overlooked because our representatives took money from companies. 

3. This reform has already passed in Arizona, Maine and Connecticut and we're working to make this a reality in Maryland!</description>
