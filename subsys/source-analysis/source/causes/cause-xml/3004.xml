  <description>We are a non-political organization devoted to helping homeless pets get off the streets.

We encourage everyone to donate to their local animal shelters because the more given to a shelter the better chance they have of being able to take in more animals.

1. Animals should not be homeless

2. We are thinking beings and it is our moral responsibility to help animals who are not

3. Homeless animals should never be turned away from a shelter, the shelters need our help to make this possible</description>
