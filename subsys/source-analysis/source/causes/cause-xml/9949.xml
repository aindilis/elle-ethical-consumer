  <description>Are you tired of knowing the blood of innocent children is dripping from your finger tips?  Do you want to see a more humane way of decorating your person?  If so, join our cause in eliminating the deaths of thousands of innocent African children.  Boycott diamonds today, so that a child can live tomorrow!

1. Children have the right to a happy and healthy childhood.

2. The rich are NOT to take advantage of the poor.

3. Education of the consumer is neccessary - would you buy a diamond if you knew little Kunta's entire family died for your bling?</description>
