1. Taiwan is an independent country and should be rightly recognized as such.

2. Taiwan did not split with the People's Republic of China. It was never part of PRC.

3. The world should denounce China for forcing unification with Taiwan.

4. To ensure its vital interests in Taiwan and long-term stability across the Taiwan Strait, the United States should recognize Taiwan's independence.</description>
