  <description>Lyme disease is an epidemic. Often misdiagnosed or missed entirely, it can leave permanent, debilitating effects if not quickly and properly treated. Many doctors, even, do not do not fully understand Lyme disease. Often, a tick bite is mistaken for a spider bite and left untreated. Also, doctors sometimes mistake the symptoms of Lyme with other disease for those of other diseases such as the Flu, Chronic Fatigue, Lupus, Fibromyalgia, and even Depression or insanity. Some doctors are even afraid to treat Lyme- insurance companies have created controversy over its dubious nature. Doctors must fear losing their license for treating a "non-existant" disease or "improperly" treating another disease with similar symptoms.  Lyme disease is a true problem- an invisible, unidentifiable killer that infects thousands every year.
