  <description>the True North Adventure camping organization is a group that helps the underprivileged kids in the area (Fox Valley) to get out and experience the wonders of the nature around us. 

1. they deserve to experience what's in store for them in the outdoors JUST as much as the rest of us do. 

2. everyone should get off there but to see these things

3. this resource we use and take for granted so much is being depleted with every breath we take, and we must promote the proper use of it ASAP</description>
