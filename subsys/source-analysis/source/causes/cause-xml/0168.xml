  <description>John McCain opposed Internet freedom and Net Neutrality in June of 2006. He didn't just oppose it, he was the deciding vote - killing an amendment that would have protected Net Neutrality.

We will urge John McCain to reverse his opposition to Internet freedom.

1. Internet freedom is essential

2. Net Neutrality is a cornerstone to Internet freedom</description>
