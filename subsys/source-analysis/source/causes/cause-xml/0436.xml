  <description>In the society we live in today the Second Admendment is constantly under attack from the ever growing government in Washington.  We believe that political action and a grassroots movement coupled with civil disobedience will bring about the needed change to protect the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.

The Constitution provides all people with the right to "Keep and Bear Arms" and becuase of this we will take any and all needed action to defend those rights.

1. The Constitution provides all responsible people with the right to keep and carry firearms.

2. There is no limit to the type and number of firearms a person should be allowed to own.

3. Firearms are a necessity for continued liberty and personal protection.</description>
