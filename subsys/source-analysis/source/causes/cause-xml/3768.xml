  <description>Gay teens are often isolated, tormented, harassed, beaten, and disowned in an intolerant and ignorant society. Mental health studies have shown that depression and anxiety are extremely common-place in people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans-gendered, or questioning.  The hardship of being a teen, gay, and depressed can be overwhelming and often times leads to suicide. 

Suicide is the third leading cause of death for ages 10 - 24 and gay teens are 4 times more likely to commit suicide than their straight peers. 

Gay or straight, a person should never have to feel suicide is the only way out. However, due to the alarming percentage of suicides that occur among teens, gay teen suicide is an extremely vital issue that is, for the most part, unknown to many.
