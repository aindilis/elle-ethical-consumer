  <description>Daniel Muir is currently in intensive training to cycle across Australia, from Perth to Sydney, to raise money for the AIDS Trust of Australia. Daniel aims to raise awareness and funds for the AIDS Trust of Australia to &#8220;break the cycle&#8221; of HIV and HIV/AIDS linked poverty. Daniel will leave Perth on 1st July 2007 and cycle to Sydney via Adelaide and 34 regional towns. He will complete the journey across Australia on the 5th August, cycling a total of 4200 Kilometres in 34 days.

With fewer than 50% of young people having comprehensive knowledge levels about HIV/AIDS, Daniel recognises the value of educating and engaging youth as well as empowering them through knowledge. 

&#8220;Many Australian youth consider AIDS to be an African disease that will not affect them, my goal is to ensure that they are equipped with the knowledge to protect themselves and realize that there is a real risk, but one they can avoid with safe health practices. The cycle allows me to combine my two main passions; sport and public health promotion.&#8221;


50% of funds raised will go to people living with HIV/AIDS and 50% will be channelled to The Thembalbantwana Centre in Cape Town, South Africa, a project supported by the AIDS Trust.
