  <description>Since the time of Abraham Lincoln, the free-trade economy, basic rights of private property, and the freedom to work for oneself in this country has been severly diminished. Child labor laws, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the minimum wage, laws forbidding the firing of strikers, the institution of welfare, public schools, the income tax, property tax, taxes in general, and many other things have come from the government to sweep the legs of capitalism out from under it. It is time we, as Americans, stood up and shouted: "My rights cannot be taken from me at the point of a gun!"

1. Freedom is the primary institution of America.

2. Capitalism is the only just economic system.

3. The right of private property should be placed before the needs of others.</description>
