  <description>This is sorta a test, I plan on opening up my own chairity called Sports For Kids. There a many talented children out there whose parents simply can't afford to put them into the sport they enjoy the most. Therefore Sports for Kids will be a non-profit organization where parents can bring their kids to register in a sport FREE OF CHARGE , sports equipment will also be accepted as donation. So I need your support guys if this is something that should get off the ground &amp; out there to parents in need then join this cause so I know Sports For Kids is a good idea. 

1. Amazing altheletes are unnoticed because their parents can't afford to train them

2. Kids should be kids &amp; PLAY </description>
