  <description>Every time something bad happens, no matter whose fault it is, its easier to blame ManBearPig for all your problems.
Example:

Bob- Hey joe you stepped on my new shoes man
Joe- no, that was MBP, stupid ass bitch
Bob- oh

see, MBP is responsible for all the worlds problems and we must rid him of our civilization and condemn him to somewhere to treachorous for men to reach, some where super far away.

Join this cause to save the planet from certain destruction.
