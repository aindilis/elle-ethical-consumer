  <description>I have always been passionate about Missing Children and talking to people about it to do what I can to bring to light the issue of missing children. It's also important to bring attention to Missing Children who do not get as much coverage as other popular missing children. Everyone deserves to be found!

Please donate funds! The NCMEC does not recieve as much money that is necessary to help find missing children. Any money that you can give can assist and help bring someone home!

1. Missing Children must be found.

2. Crimes against children must be prevented.

3. ALL Children must be protected.

4. Everyone should assist in helping Missing Children.</description>
