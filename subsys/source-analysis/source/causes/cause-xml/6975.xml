  <description>New York City's carriage horses are often underfed, overworked and physically abused. They are forced to work in extreme cold and hot conditions even though the law forbids it. 

If you have ever seen the horses being worked in Central Park or parked outside on the street, you have without a doubt seen many who shouldn't be forced to work. If you see something, say something. 

1. Stop the overall mistreatment of the horses.

2. Create harsher punishment and laws to those who violate animal rights laws. 

3. Provide proper information to NYC tourists and the general public</description>
