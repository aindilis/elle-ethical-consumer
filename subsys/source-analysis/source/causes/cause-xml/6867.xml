  <description>Did you know that when you do not close the toilet lid before you flush, the contents that are sprayed, though not visible to the human eye, may fly several feet away from the toilet? 

This allows for viruses and bacteria, which may survive for hours, to circulate through the entire bathroom area. 


You don't care? Think again... Do you store your toothbrush in the bathroom? 

Do you like your own fecal matter in your mouth? How about someone else's? 

Don't believe me? Try an experiment with dye, saran wrap (cling film), and your own toilet. 


Let's make lid-closing hygienic STANDARD! 

NB- The lid must be closed PRIOR to any flushing!







1. Closing the toilet lid before flushing significantly reduces the viral and bacterial content in bathrooms, and should be a hygienic standard. 

2. The lid must be closed PRIOR to flushing, not WHILE flushing. 

3. People should be persuaded to close the lid after they use the toilet.  

4. All Western-Style toilets OUGHT to have lids!! </description>
