  <description>Christianity has been left in a state of disrepair because we have neglected many of the core doctrines of the bible. This cause is for people who believe that the bible is the sole authority of christianity and that no other authority supecedes it.

1. The bible is the one true authority for all christians

2. The Bible is the inspired word of God written by him through men and is his revelation of himself to mankind; it contains the plan for salvation

3. The church must come to an acceptance of the teaching of the word of God in its entirety

4. The individual must develop an interpretation based on personal relationship and knowledge of God as a person.</description>
