  <description>In celebration of World Food Day (October 16th), Global Volunteer Network Foundation invites you to join our annual fundraiser &#8216;Eat So They Can.&#8217; The event is an international campaign that will take place on 16-17 October 2010 and it invites people from all around the world to participate in what will collectively be one huge dinner party, where something as simple as sharing a meal with friends can help to end poverty.

This meal will be special not only because it&#8217;s a great chance to entertain and spend time with your friends but also because it&#8217;s a chance to discuss issues facing the women and children around the world, to pledge to take action, and to fundraise!
