  <description>DRM products have features built-in that restrict what jobs they can do. These products have been intentionally crippled from the users' perspective, and are therefore "defective by design". This campaign will identify these &#8220;defective&#8221; products, and target them for elimination. We aim to make DRM an anti-social technology. We aim for the abolition of DRM as a social practice.
