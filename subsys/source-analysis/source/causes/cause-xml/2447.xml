  <description>This flag is for people who want to save their heritage and think that those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.

1. The Confederate flag use by hate groups (KKK) should end immediatley

2. Northerner should learn to practice what they preach and not be bigoted towards proud Southerners

3. People of ALL races should learn to judge others based on the content of their character not their skin color

4. Most importantly everyone should learn to love others as Jesus commands us</description>
