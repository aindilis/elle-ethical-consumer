  <description>On October 7th, 2007 I will be running in the Chicago Marathon with Joints in Motion.  The money that I raise through this endeavor will go to support arthritis research and education.
In training for this marathon I am striving towards two goals: to run 26.2 miles, and to raise $3500 which will make a difference in the lives of the more than 70 million Americans suffering from arthritis.
Donations are fabulous but moral support and fundraising suggestions are also very welcome. 
Donations can be made at my website:

1. Arthritis research can help to curb the disease that is quickly reaching epidemic proportions in our society.

2. Arthrits affects one in three people and does not discriminate based on age, race or gender.</description>
