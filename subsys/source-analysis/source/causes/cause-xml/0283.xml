  <description>Since its founding in 1925, the VFW National Home for Children has grown from an old frame farm house to a sprawling campus with playgrounds, park areas, and multiple buildings, including single-family homes, a community center and gymnasium, child care center, guest lodge, chapel and administrative offices.

The National Home&#8217;s services have also evolved to meet the changing needs of America&#8217;s military and veterans&#8217; families. Through our Helpline and our on-campus programs, we are able to help families and children through times of crisis, both here on our beautiful campus and in their own communities nationwide.

1. Every child deserves to be able to have a childhood.

2. Our country's heroes should not have to worry about the safety and care of their family while they are away.

3. In supporting the VFW National Home, we are thanking our veterans and current soldiers for protecting us.</description>
