  <description>Prairie dogs are unnecessarily killed for land developement and wherever they are seen as pests. Instead, we should encourage that they be relocated, or more importantly and primarily, have their habitats salvaged, preserved and protected.

Prairie dogs are part of an entire ecosystem that includes eagles, hawks, magpies, owls (including burrowing owls), snakes, foxes, coyotes, rabbits, black footed ferrits, badgers, salamanders, insects, plants and countless of other living organisms. They all survive on eachother for food and/or shelter. If you get rid of one, you risk getting rid of them all. 

Please support this cause. These little guys need us to look after them.
