  <description>Do you remember as a kid when you could go out and buy all those fun fireworks like m-80's? Well i do, and im tired of not being able to get the good stuff anymore except sparklers from kroger.  Join together and we can fight to get the good fireworks!

1. We want the good fireworks, no more sparklers.

2. Fireworks must explode and be marginally dangerous

3. Loud bangs and projectile fireworks should be sold EVERYWHERE</description>
