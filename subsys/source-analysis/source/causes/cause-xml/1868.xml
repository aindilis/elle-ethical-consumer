Why is it that the Iranian government recognizes that peace will bring stability, yet actively persue instability. Terrorism has dulled our senses. In the Palestinian question, who gets the blame for the lack of progress? The West. In Lebanon - a crisis deliberately provoked by, again, the same forces, who is held responsible? Israel. There is no alternative to fighting this menace wherever it rears its head. There are no demands that are remotely negotiable. It has to be beaten. Period.
