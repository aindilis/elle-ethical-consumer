  <description>The American Anti-Slavery Group (AASG) is a nonprofit organization that works with former victims of human trafficking to abolish modern-day slavery, focusing primarily on systems of chattel slavery in Sudan and Mauritania. Through awareness-raising, advocacy, grassroots activism and direct aid, we fight for the freedom of millions held in bondage around the world.

2007 marks the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade - and yet experts estimate that today there are 27 million people enslaved around the world &#8211; more than were taken from Africa in the four centuries of the slave trade.
