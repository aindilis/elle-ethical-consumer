  <description>It's not a secret. Gas prices are out of control and reached a historic high this Memorial Day weekend, the official start of summer drive season. It's time for Congress to do something meaningful to control gas prices by requiring our cars, light trucks and SUVs to go further on a gallon of gasoline. But the powerful auto industry continues to stand in the way of miles per gallon standards.

Congress hasn't increased fuel efficiency standards since 1975 and after decades of inaction, it's time to get America moving with more fuel efficient vehicles. The debate is heating up in Congress and support for increasing fuel standards has a lot of momentum. But the auto industry, big oil and their army of lobbyists have shifted into high gear to oppose new fuel efficiency standards that will save us money on gasoline.

The average household is going to shell out more than $3,200 this year on gas. An average fuel efficiency standard of 35 miles per gallon will save a typical family more than $500 annually.

Tell the auto industry to stop standing in the way of efforts to increase fuel efficiency standards that will save American families money at the pump.
