  <description>Ever since the first major federal gun control law (The National Firearms Act (NFA)) was passed in 1934 as a way to prevent blacks, the poor, and minorities from gaining access to firearms, the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States has been under attack. 
Since then, the Government has restricted the People's right to arms severely. The fact that "good people" are restricted from owning guns while "bad people" still continue to get access to guns means that the average citizen is improperly equipped to defend himself, as evidenced in tragedies like the Columbine High School, Virginia Tech shootings, and daily victims of violent criminals all around the country

The Second Amendment reads: "A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." It is an individual right outlined in the Federalist Papers and District of Columbia v. Heller, 544 U.S. ___ (2008).

Please support this cause if you believe good, law-abiding citizens should be able to bear firearms for both sporting and defense.

I sincerely thank you for your support.

1. The People must be able to keep and bear arms without restriction.

2. The People must be able to purchase arms without undue hardships.

3. The People must be able to legitimately and effectively defend themselves without fear of consequence</description>
