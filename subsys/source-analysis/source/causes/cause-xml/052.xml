  <description>&lt;b&gt;Abstinence-only-until-marriage programs that censor and distort information about condoms and contraception fuel the STD epidemic by denying young people the information they need to protect their health.&lt;/b&gt;

Sex education needs to be relevant to real lives, and real lives are about more than abstinence and condoms.  Real lives are about making decisions, setting goals, managing pressure and stress, building relationships and friendships, and understanding who we are.

Comprehensive sex education teaches young people these skills and provides youth with the information necessary to make responsible, well informed decisions.  

&lt;b&gt;Recently, a Congressionally mandated evaluation showed abstinence-only-until-marriage programs to be ineffective.  

Youth deserve access to programs that work.  Youth deserve accurate information about sexual and reproductive health!&lt;/b&gt;


1. Young people have the right to accurate and complete information about their sexual and reproductive health.

2. Abstinence-only-until-marriage programs mislead young people and promote scientifically-inaccurate information.

3. A recent evaluation mandated by Congress revealed that abstinence-only programs are misguided and ineffective.</description>
