  <description>Do you know someone who is having some hardships? Any little thing could help them, you know. A hug, a smile, or even just saying hi to that person you don't even know could help change their life completely. So don't just say you're going to help that certain person. Take some action! 

1. Too many children and teens bring guns to school because they feel unloved.

2. Too many children and teens runaway, get caught, and are put in children's homes because they feel unwanted.

3. And too many children and teens commit suicide because they feel worthless.

4. Too many children and teens slit their wrists because they didn't feel like they were good enough.

5. Too many children and teens starve themselves because they feel unaccepted by their peers and themselves.

6. And all of these things have happened because nobody reached out to them. All it takes is a hello, a smile, sitting with them in the lunch room, or just standing beside them. It doesn't take words. Just a Friend.</description>
