  <description>The US Navy is planning on building an Outlying Landing Field that will be in the middle of an area that is home to large groups of migratory birds. The US Navy has chosen the area despite of the danger to the birds and to the pilots. Scientific data from BAM (Bird Avoidance Model) and a recent radar study conducted by Ronald L. Merritt a former Chief of the USAF BASH (Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard) Task Force forecast severe risk of BASH: Letter to Navy Secretary England, October 2003. Whatever your position either for the birds, or for the pilots, or both, this site is not at all a good place, but very dangerous to everything that would be in it. Support the move to stop Congress from funding the building of the OLF.

1. The US Navy must change the location for the OLF.</description>
