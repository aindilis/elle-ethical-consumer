  <description>Camp Geneva exists to encourage young people to develop a commitment to love and serve Jesus Christ. Since it&#8217;s beginning in 1948, GENEVA has carried out a high quality, Christ-centered summer camp program for youth that takes them out of their normal environment and all its distractions, puts them with counselors who love kids and live out their faith in an active and appealing way, enmeshes them in a program that exposes them to the vitality of the Christian life, and provides opportunities for campers to consider how they ought to respond to the love that God has for them. It&#8217;s a program built upon relationships that revolves around experiencing the Christian faith in all its fullness.
