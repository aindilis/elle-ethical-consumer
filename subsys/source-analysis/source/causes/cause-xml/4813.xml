  <description>The hip hop industry has changed dramatically since its beginnings. It has become all about getting money by pushing negative images of black women and black men. In turn, people everywhere percieve us as "niggas" and "hos" which we are not. In order to end these negative images and lifestyles that are based off of values learned in prisons we must raise awareness and do our best to change the way the industry is. Hip Hop and Rap does not have to disappear, but the negative words and images most definitely do.

1. Black women are not whores.

2. Being "gangsta" is not that cool.</description>
