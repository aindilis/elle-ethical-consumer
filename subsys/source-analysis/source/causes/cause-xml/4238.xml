  <description>Pierre decided to buy a Porsche. After he found his favorite Porsche he opened his wallet and discovered that he doesn&#8217;t have enough change to buy the car. It costs $720,000 without tax and gas. Since he is very smart, he knew that his friends will help him raise money to buy the car. Generously, he excluded the price of gas from this cause.  
Please help Pierre buy the $720,000 Porsche. God bless you&#8230;

1. All great People like Pierre deserve a Porsche

2. Forget about the poor and the homeless. They don't know much about Porsche.</description>
