  <description>Millions of children all over the world are being abused in many different ways. 

Sexual, verbal, physical and psychological abuse are just a few. This isn't something new and it certainly isn't controlled. 

We, as a humane population, need to put an end to this once and for all. 

1. Children deserve a happy and carefree childhood

2. People who abuse children should be dealt with harshly

3. Abuse in childhood will lead to an unhealthy adulthood. </description>
