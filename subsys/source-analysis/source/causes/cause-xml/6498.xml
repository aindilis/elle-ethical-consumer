  <description>Prison Dharma Network has distributed over 10,000 books to prisoners in the past 16 years. All books donated (with the exception of our Prison Dharma Press books) are donated by people like you. 

Please send donations of used books (no magazines, please) on contemplative practice (meditation, yoga, etc) to PDN, PO Box 4623, Boulder CO 80306. All cash donations will go to offset the costs of mailing and postage. 

We get letters every week from prisoners telling us how even one book has radically changed their lives for the better.

1. Spiritual transformation is not just for the privileged

2. Books can change lives

3. Kindness pays off in countless ways</description>
