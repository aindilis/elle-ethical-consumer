  <description>Fady el Khatib is the best player in Lebanon ..due to the years he spent at 7ekmeh...He never wanted to leave the team but when the team felt a part, offcourse our national team captain will leave to remain playing in the first division after threats of 7ekmeh going down to D2. He should come back to play in a well organized 7ekmeh team next season with Joe Ghattas, Alvin Sims and Goerges Ke3di. 

1. Make 7ekmeh the best team in Asia again 

2. Fady is a true leader with Mchantaf as Manager</description>
