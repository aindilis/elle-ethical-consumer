  <description>Our Vision

 

Artist's Junction International is committed to enabling like-minded artists in towns and cities around the world become arts based, faith -integrated,"junction builders" in their communties. 

 

A local vision can start small as simply one gathering of a handful of committed artists meeting once a month in comfortable setting such as a home, gallery, studio, church, or coffeehouse. As these groups grow, vision quite often builds toward a greater goal of community service through hosting arts conferences or creating a communtiy art center.
