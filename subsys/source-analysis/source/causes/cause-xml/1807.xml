  <description>Welcome to the site that started it all - Pediatric AIDS Worldwide
 

If you have the chance, read the book by Elizabeth Glaser and her heartwrenching but heartwarming account of the struggle that she and her family faced. I have read this book, and it really hit home. 

It's because of this strong woman and her story, that I decided to start this group in orderto do my part and get word out to help "educate to eliminate" 

So people like you, could help join in the fight for Pediatric AIDS Worldwide. And this is the place to start. As you know, the world is a big place and countless live with this diease everyday. Please take a moment, have a look at this group...join the cause to fight this affliction...we may not have a cure yet, but work has progressed so much over the years...

Join me in the fight against Pediatric AIDS Worldwide!

Thank you!

Managers: Jennifer Sheaves and Mae Tibbets
