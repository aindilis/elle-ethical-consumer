  <description>We believe that girls' education is very crucial, whether at primary school, high school, or college. The number of girls attending is very minimal. Some parents don't have the money to send their girls to school, especially in the rural villages. Parents usually send their boys to school rather than send their girls. For a child to go to school, the parents have to pay for school supplies, furniture and uniforms plus a contribution for the salary of the teachers. Even in private high schools, in a class of 55 people, only 10 or 12 are girls.  The cost of sending a girl to school is only $40 per year. Most of us spend much more on superficial things like shoes or movies while to these girls this money can make the difference of a lifetime!

Together with our sister chapter in Mali, we will find out about other barriers that keep girls from getting an educations. These obstacles include having to work, paying school fees and not having enough teachers. We will help solve these problems. We have been selling pencils and other school supplies to earn money to improve girls' education. Now we are sending 56 Elementary-High School aged girls to school and are continuing our goal to achieve girls education world wide!
