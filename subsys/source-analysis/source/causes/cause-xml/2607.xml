  <description>On 8 October 2005, at 0350 GMT, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India, leaving about 75,000 dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. 

Almost two years have passed now - however the need for continued support and reconstruction aid remains.

Last year, about 400,000 people face a second winter without permanent shelter in the mountains and valleys of northern Pakistan, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

The UN says there are about 55,000 people still living in 45 tent camps where temperatures can drop to -15C or -20C in the highest villages. 

Undoubtedly, a lot has been done in two years, however there is even more to be accomplished. Supporting this group will continue to raise awareness and provide funds to those who can help make a difference to people affected by this disaster.
