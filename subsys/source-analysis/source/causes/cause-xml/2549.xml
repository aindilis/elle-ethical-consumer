  <description>Are you sick of people asking you if have ridden an elephant/lion/rhino/hyena to school?

Are you sick of people asking you if you know simba?

Do you wonder why all Disney movies about Africa only show animals??

Do you wish that Africa would get more recognition for its achievements and not its problems?

Do you wish that the only reason people talk about Africa wasn't because a celebrity adopted a child there??


If yes to any of the above (and millions more) join this cause and forward it to all of your African brothers and sisters.


We are also here to help one another in an effort to benefit those in Africa who are not living in a peaceful situation so check out other causes we support like Invisible Children and Save Darfur.
