  <description>James 1:27 says, &#8220;Religion that is pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction&#8230;&#8221; Covenant Mercies is committed to seeing this biblical mandate lived out practically in the context of the local church. Through our Orphan Sponsorship Program, we work with local churches in Uganda, Zambia, and Ethiopia to facilitate care for hundreds of children by means of their extended families. Where no extended family is available, we construct orphans&#8217; homes where the children can be raised in a normal family environment, integrated into the life of the local church and endowed not only with daily sustenance, but also with biblical instruction and a Christian upbringing. 

It is our conviction that in certain cases, the best and most complete way to care for an orphaned child is to make him an orphan no longer through adoption. Covenant Mercies actively pursues opportunities to match orphaned children with loving adoptive families,even as we continue caring for the majority within the context of their respective homelands.
