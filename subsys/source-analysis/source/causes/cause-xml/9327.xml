  <description>When we first saw the thousands of children running for their lives, we were surprised by the lack of international attention. No one was talking about child soldiers, night commuters or the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army.  So, we asked ourselves, &#8220;How can we help?&#8221; While we had our own big ideas in the beginning, the more time we spent among the people of Uganda, the more their reoccurring pleas became our development strategies. 

Invisible Children is not offering a handout, but instead, a life-long investment in vulnerable youth. We provide them with quality education and valuable life skills that enable them to take responsibility for their future and the future of their country.

To achieve this goal we emphasize community involvement and Ugandan leadership. As a part of a global community, we also promote cross-cultural education, and continuously look for ways we can better work together in defending the oppressed and promoting peace.
