  <description>Friends of the IDF helps support social, educational and recreational programs and facilities for the young men and women soldiers of Israel who defend the Jewish homeland. We also provide these services to the widows and children of soldiers who have fallen in defense of Israel.

Today's support includes; building, maintaining and operating 17 modern and sophisticated facilities; establishing and renovating hundreds of clubrooms and fitness rooms on IDF bases; and the constant caring for each and every IDF soldier.
