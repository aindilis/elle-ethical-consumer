We are proposing a &#8220;green&#8221; Downtown Berkeley centerpiece project, featuring a well-designed public plaza graced by a flowing portion of Strawberry creek, crisscrossed by attractive bridges connecting shops and restaurants with museums and buildings featuring green design.

1. The Strawberry Creek Plaza plans will need to be incorporated into the larger Downtown Area Plan the City of Berkeley and the University of California are developing. 

2. The plaza/creek design should be integrated into the overall master plan for the downtown core.</description>
