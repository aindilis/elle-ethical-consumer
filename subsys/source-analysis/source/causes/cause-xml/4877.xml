  <description>The Tasmanian Devils, native only to Tasmania, Australia, have been decreasing in numbers for the past 10-12 years.  Little is known about the facial tumor disease that has been killing off the Devils, but what is known is that there are only about 50% left of one of Tassie's greatest species.  Something needs to be done...and soon.  Tassie has already lost the Tasmanian Tiger, lets not let another of it's species become extinct
