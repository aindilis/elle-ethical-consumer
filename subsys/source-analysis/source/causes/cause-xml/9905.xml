  <description>The Rebelution started in August 2005, when Alex and Brett were 16 years old. Today the website and conferences have reached hundreds-of-thousands of teens around the world with the challenge to rebel against low expectations and "do hard things" for the glory of God.

On April 15, 2008 their first book -- Do Hard Things: A Teenage Rebellion Against Low Expectations -- was released by Multnomah Books, a division of Random House.

Noble Institute is the nonprofit organization under which the Rebelution Tour and website are run. All donations will go directly towards furthering the work of the Rebelution and its vision.

1. Society expects little of teens, God expects much.

2. We are capable of far more than we think.

3. God has a special calling on our generation to do hard things for His glory.</description>
