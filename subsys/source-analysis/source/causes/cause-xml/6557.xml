  <description>In a world already fraught with inhumanities its about time we stood up against the abusers of woman and children in any way whatsoever!! Our woman and children are the anchors in our families and the dreams of our future. We need solidarity, ONE voice to bring the perpatrators to book!!

1. Alchohol a major contributor to abuse

2. Poor education, it starts with unawreness

3. Where self esteem and self worth has been broken down to gain control we need to help rebuild those aspects of a persons life. </description>
