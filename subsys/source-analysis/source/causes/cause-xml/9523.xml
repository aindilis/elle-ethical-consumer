  <description>Colombianitos was created with one purpose: to make the difference. Our love for the Colombian children and our conviction that the future of a country lies in the hands of the little ones, has led us to creating integrated education proposals, recreational and rehabilitation programs for all those children whose life is lived among bullets, crimes, drugs and shortage. We are here to reduce their pain, to make their existence a bit more bearable, to put a smile on their faces.  

1. Provide prosthesis and rehabilitation for those children mutilated during the war that is going on in Colombia.

2. Recreational programs, including sports and music, meant to develop companionship and coexistence abilities. 

3. As a complement to the sports programs, we provide the children with food and health assistance.</description>
