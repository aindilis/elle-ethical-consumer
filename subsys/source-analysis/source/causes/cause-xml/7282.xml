  <description>Why should we support corporations or other entities that are doing business with a country that is supporting terrorists around the world and brutally oppressing its people?

Iran, one of the world's worst human rights violators has been the # 1 state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 according to the US State Department. Iran has also been racing to build a nuclear weapon while calling for the destruction of a UN member state. 

Donations to this cause will benefit the Divest Terror Initiative (DivestTerror.org) at the Center for Security Policy.  

Please invite friends and family to join this cause!

1. Divestment is the most promising non-violent strategy of convincing Iran to reconsider its dangerous nuclear program 

2. A targeted divestment campaign will only penalize the Iranian military and its business partners who are financing terror and the Iranian nuclear program

3. Iran's economy is vulnerable and a careful divestment initiative will prevent radical Ayatollahs from acquiring nuclear weapons without firing a shot</description>
  <mission>Our mission is to convince citizens and federal/state government to divest from Iranian industries and their partners who are building nuclear weapons and financing terror.  </mission>
