  <description>Almost 2,000 children were murdered in the United States during 1996, but none of those murders has fascinated the American public and attracted the mass media like that of JonBenet Ramsey. And a year after the little girl died, the spotlight is still hot and her killing is still unsolved.

There are few who have not heard of the story of JonBenet Ramsey, the young pagent queen killed in her own home at the age of 6 years old. The story of this rising beauty spread across the country like wildfire, she was first "kidnapped" and then found by her own father in the wine cellar of their home in Boulder, Colorado. She died of strangulation and a massive blow to the head. I don't believe this young girl deserved to die, but her fate was God's plan. I think that her story should be known and never forgotten.
