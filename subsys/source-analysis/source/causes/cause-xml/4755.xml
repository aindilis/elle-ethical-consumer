  <description>Anorexia is an eating disorder where people starve themselves. Anorexia usually begins in young people around the onset of puberty. Individuals suffering from anorexia have extreme weight loss. Weight loss is usually 15% below the person's normal body weight. People suffering from anorexia are very skinny but are convinced that they are overweight. Weight loss is obtained by many ways. Some of the common techniques used are excessive exercise, intake of laxatives and not eating. 

We have to stop this disease !!!!! Specially today, the media is showing skinny models and actresses and this  is influencing young girls in a very bad way and they are thinking that they have to be size 0 to be perfect !!!
