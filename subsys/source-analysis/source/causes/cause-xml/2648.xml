  <description>Columbine was a gun free zone, Virginia Tech was a gun free zone, yet kids still managed to get guns in.

In the virginia Tech tragedy, the police were unable to prevent any violence until the attacker killed 32 people.

Had even one person been able to defend themselves, they could have saved most of the lives that were lost.


Also, I wouldn't donate to the NRA if I were you, because this isn't even on their agenda I don't think. I just put them there because I had to choose one and that seemed the most relevant.

1. The Right to Bear Arms is an individual right

2. The ability for a school or State to take away the Right to Bear Arms should be the same as their ability to take away the freedom of speech

3. Students should still have to follow all other laws regarding registration, ownership, and carrying of their weapon.</description>
