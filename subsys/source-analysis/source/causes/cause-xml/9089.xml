  <description>After having lost two jobs over complete bullcrap, i'm just completely drained. It seems I can't get a break to save my life. I know that some of my friends have had even bigger kicks in the nads and i just need a few kind words right now as i'm sure they've needed in their times of trial. God grant me the serenity and you know the rest.

1. Friends are miracles we can see

2. Life shows no mercy

3. aqua teen hunger force is the most awesome show ever period</description>
