  <description>With every member there will be a two dollar obligation to donate towards research into cancer prevention. Included in the search to cure cancer is also a search into further stem cell capabilities and other amazing technologies which can possibly stop the suffering of human beings with diseases which will one day be a things of the past.

You say to yourself that donating only two dollars per person will do nothing to help prevent cancer. That is not at all true, by your commitment and dedication to helping your fellow man you can get your friends to join. If 1000.00 people adds only two dollars thats $2000.00. If they were all to invite one friend then the donations would increase exponentially creating one of the strongest basis' for research. WE AS A COMMUNITY CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. 

THIS IS A NECESSARY CAUSE!!! Lets let our donations spread like cancer and eventually drown it out.

1. Cancer does not choose its victims.

2. Stem Cell research is a viable method to cancer prevention.

3. THE CURE IS IN OUR HANDS!!!

4. We have the moral obligation to help our fellow man.</description>
