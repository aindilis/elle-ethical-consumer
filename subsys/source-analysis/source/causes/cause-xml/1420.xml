  <description>The Golden Apple Foundation of Illinois believes in quality education for every student, not only families that live in suburban areas. The Golden Apple Scholars of Illinois program drives college students to help young students that attend schools of need all over the state of Illinois. We will all be working in schools of need in IL for 5 years after we graduate college with proper training and months of experience in low income schools. We do this because we know the importance of education and believe that everyone deserves a chance. This group is for people who are apart of the Golden Apple family, and for people who support our cause, because ALL children deserve excellent teachers. 

1. All children deserve excellent teachers.

2. Children in rough neighborhoods need teachers that believe in them.</description>
