  <description>Abortion Stops A Beating Heart.
Thats Murder.

[An abortion is the removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus from the uterus, resulting in its death.] 


"To abort the life, which is human in nature, is to kill that which is human in nature. 
Therefore, abortion is killing a life which is human by nature.
Where, then, does the mother get the right to kill the human within her?"(Slick, 1995-2007).
