  <description>I was in the park the other day, and I saw every duck but two beside the water. I looked in the water, and you could barely see anything. The water quality in those ponds has drastically gotten more poor in the past couple years, and I want to stop it. This is not just for the ducks and other animals that swim and live in Stanley Park, but for the park-goers ourselves. I hope that I am not the only one who thinks it is depressing to see the ponds so gross. I, who in the 18 years of my life, grew up at the duck ponds at Stanley, and I can't see them go to waste. 

1. Water conditions in the ponds at Stanley Park need to improve.</description>
