  <description>Everyone knows my old 94 grandam is gehetto!
And that is it going down the tubes to be known as a junker.
Engine problems everyweek
etc etc
So I have issued this preemptive strike!
If everyone on facebook donates 75 cents,
(everyone meaning everysingle member)
I can get a AUDI A4!
So help a brother out
Thanks

Probably will end up getting a used honda the A4 was a joke,
All extra money will be donated to a local homeless shelter

1. Get me a car that might actually last 6 years

2. So that i can visit my family when i go to college

3. and have a reliable source of transportation</description>
