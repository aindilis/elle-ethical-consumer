  <description>Jerusalem is a holy city to the three great religions of Judaism, Islam and Christianity. It should belong to the world, not just the State of Israel. 

In 1948, the United Nations devised a plan that would make Jerusalem an international city under UN administration. Because of the 1948 war, and other wars thereafter, this never came to be.

Today, Jerusalem is considered "the undivided capital of Israel" except for the sacred Temple Mount, which is occupied by Jordanian administered Muslims.

Many Christian holy places are also run by Muslim Palestinians with Israeli-built ticket windows which set the hours and sometimes charge and keep the proceeds from admissions. 

The Vatican has proposed this plan, little thought has since been given to its implementation.

Everyone should have the opportunity to visit their holy places without any hinderance from anyone, ever. 



1. That the city of Jerusalem is declared independent of the State of Israel.

2. That the holy city of Jerusalem be placed under international, UN administration, as initially planned in 1948.

3. That holy places are given to the custody of the religious communities to which they are sacred.</description>
