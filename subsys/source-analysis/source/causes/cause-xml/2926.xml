  <description>International China Concern began in 1993 in response to the immense needs of China's abandoned and disabled children. 

Each year thousands upon thousands of disabled children face abandonment into China's state run welfare system. Due to a lack of resources, training and support many children die within a few months. 

Since 1993 International China Concern, a Christian development organisation, has worked in partnership with the Chinese government to bring love, hope and opportunity to China's abandoned and disabled. 

Through the provision of residential care, group homes, foster care, therapy, education, vocational training &amp; employment, community outreach, etc. ICC is helping to transform the lives of China's abandoned and disabled community. 

Join us as we seek to make a difference!


1. Each year thousands upon thousands of disabled children are needlessly abandoned. 

2. Most abandoned children with disabilities face a bleak future without our help.

3. ICC's work offers love, hope and opportunity through practical expressions of care. </description>
