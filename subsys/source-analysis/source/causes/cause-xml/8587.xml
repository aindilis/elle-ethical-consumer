  <description>Angel 34 was started by Nicole Sheriff during her battle with Ewing Sarcoma. Sadly, Nicole passed on when she was 15, leaving her family and friends to carry on her legacy. It was her wish for children and families to have their own Angel during their time of need. Donations help provide ICEE machines to hospitals, aid children and families financially, provide scholarships and help with the continuing search for a cure.
