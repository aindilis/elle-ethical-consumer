  <description>Every year there are thousands of people in each state without a home or shelter to go to. A good percentage of them are teens who've been let go out of foster care or abandoned by family. This is not only a cuse to end the homelessness in the country but to end teen homelessness and prevent it from happening again.

But its up to those who have the resources and time to help these individuals out, and give them a home.

1. No one should be without shelter.

2. No teen should be abandoned.

3. Everyone can help end this.</description>
