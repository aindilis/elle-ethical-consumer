  <description>9/11 May be over, but terrorism is not. We need to keep supporting the american troops overseas as they try to finish the job they started. Many Liberal minded people believe we should pack up and leave Iraq right now, but it should be understood that the troops are trying to finish their jobs and not leave unfinished business. Lets Support them so in time they can come back home knowing they have completed their job to create stability in the middle east. We Support not only our troops, But President Bush as Well.

1. We Must Finish Our Job In Iraq.

2. We Need To Completely End Terrorism.</description>
