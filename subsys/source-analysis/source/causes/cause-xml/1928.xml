2. End the the brutal blood shed of the innocent Palestinians under all false Israeli Pollitical claims.

4. a Call for Israel to acknowledge its responsibility for the dispossession of Palestinian families and people, and to recognise the right of all Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland and to be compensated.

5. a Call for every national government to use all diplomatic means available to influence Israel to cease the occupation, and to support Palestinians in their efforts to rebuild their nation. </description>
