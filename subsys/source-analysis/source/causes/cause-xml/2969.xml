  <description>Gibraltar could be a beautiful paradise were it not for the care free attitude and behaviour of many of our citizens.
People drive to work and about in cars or mopeds. Very few walk anywhere. Bicycles are&#180;rare and hated by the police!  There are still token, useless double Decker buses stinking the place out.
Tourists are harassed into taking a coach or taxi to go up the rock when this is only an hours walk maximum.
The youth&#180;s ambition is to reach the age when they get their noisy mopeds and cars to ride about Gibraltar with their mobile discotheques. 
There are about 50000 cars in Gibraltar and all contribute to air and noise pollution, they spoil the scenery and are a waste of space.  The average mass of a Gibraltarian is also increasing!

1. Leave the car at home no traffic.

2. More trees less parking spaces.

3. Right to breathe clean air.</description>
