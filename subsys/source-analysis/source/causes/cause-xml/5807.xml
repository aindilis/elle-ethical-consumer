  <description>This summer the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) decided to overturn the unique circumstances precedent. Just to give you some background and context, let me explain the case:

A pro se on death row appealed to a federal appellate court to have his district ruling lifted or remanded. The appellate judge told him he had 18 days to file. He made a mistake or lied. The prose only had 14 days. When he filed his papers on the 17th day, he was quite surprised when the appellate judge basically told him to go fuck himself and enjoy waiting for a lethal injection needle.

Normally, the Supreme Court would fix this. There's a precedent which has established that under "unique circumstances" certain cases must be revisited. Not this time. Not any more. SCOTUS decided that expediency trumps justice. 

In my opinion, the whole purpose of justice is to protect and to restore the innocent. When we choose expediency over justice, we are forgetting the very ethos, purpose, and principle of the justice system. 

I realize that in an age of Paris Hilton that people may not be concerned with justice. I hope I'm wrong because if I'm not then angels sing a dirge for our Republic. Lay her down, she is dead.
