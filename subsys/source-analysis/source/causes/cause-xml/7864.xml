  <description>The Haitian Sports Foundation (HSF) currently works with three main program organizations, Athletic d'Haiti and Piti pou ti moun (Mercy for the Children) and the Okinawa Club.  Between all three programs over 3,000 kids participate.  Each program is located in one of Haiti's toughest and poorest areas, Cite-solei, Carrefour Bizoton.  It is the hope of the foundation that we can continue to provide support to all three programs with hopes to expand to even more kids in need.  All three programs desperately needs our help, from health care, food,athletic supplies and school supplies.  It is our hope that we can provide hope and opportunity for these kids and give them a future.  Through sports we can aid change and facilitate opportunity.  Help the children of Haiti.
