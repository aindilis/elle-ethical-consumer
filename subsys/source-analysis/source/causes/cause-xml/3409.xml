  <description>M&#233;ni&#232;re's disease is an abnormality of the inner ear causing a host of symptoms, including vertigo or severe dizziness, tinnitus or a roaring sound in the ears, fluctuating hearing loss, and the sensation of pressure or pain in the affected ear. 

Based on a recent study, NIDCD estimates that there are currently approximately 615,000 individuals with diagnosed M&#233;ni&#232;re's disease in the United States and 45,500 newly diagnosed cases each year.

While there is currently no cure for M&#233;ni&#232;re's disease,Scientists are investigating environmental and biological factors that may cause this debilitating disease or induce an attack. They are also studying how fluid composition and movement in the labyrinth affect hearing and balance. By studying hair cells in the inner ear, which are responsible for proper hearing and balance, scientists are learning how the ear converts the mechanical energy of sound waves and motion into nerve impulses. Insights into the mechanisms of M&#233;ni&#232;re's disease will enable scientists to develop preventive strategies and more effective treatment.
