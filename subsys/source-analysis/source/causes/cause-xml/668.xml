Mustard Seed School is an independent school in Hoboken, New Jersey, providing a K-8 education to urban students.

The school was founded in 1979 to address the educational needs of the urban community, to stimulate and broaden the experiences of city children, and to educate students in an intercultural, interdenominational Christian setting. Mustard Seed School has an intentional mission to the urban poor.

At Mustard Seed we're grateful for the generous support from individuals, foundations, corporations, local businesses, and churches. Financial support comes from not only the tri-state area, but also from around the country and around the world. The school relies on support from those who have a passion for offering a Christian education to the children of Hudson County, especially the urban poor.

Most of the money raised from external donors is used for tuition assistance, making it possible for students who cannot pay full tuition to attend Mustard Seed.

Mustard Seed School is a registered 501C(3) nonprofit organization. All gifts are tax deductible. We are able to receive gifts of cash, securities, and bequests. Planned gifts should be coordinated through the development office.
