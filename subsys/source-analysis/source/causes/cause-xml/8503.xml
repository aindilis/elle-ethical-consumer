  <description>Camp Program 
 
ANCHOR's Junior Camp, Senior Camp, and Young Adults have been scheduled for a busy and varied program of summer fun. Diverse activities are adapted to accommodate the age and ability of the individual camper and the group. 

Sports activities include basketball, softball, volleyball, bowling, court games, field hockey, and physical fitness.

Group singing, rhythm band, country dancing, musical games, body movement, and musical shows are featured as part of the dance program.

Arts and Crafts, ceramics, home economics, movies, and clubs are also enjoyed regularly by ANCHOR campers.

Swim instruction and recreational pool swimming are integral parts of the camp program. Ocean bathing and sand play also play important roles in the weekly schedule.

Participants partake in a field trip program which partially depends on monies received as contributions from parents to the ANCHOR Program Fund, Inc.

Special events highlight the camp season. These include live shows, bands, puppet theatres, carnivals, field day, barbecues, swim festival, etc.
