  <description>If more people cycled, and used cars less, then we could help prevent global warming.

The government might notice and introduce realistic bike lanes, thereby increasing safety on the roads. 

More cyclists and less drivers means less traffic congestion, less dependence on importation of oil, and saving money otherwise spent on petrol.

Less people would be fat and risking heart-failure!

Bikes are cheap[er than cars]!

1. Fight global warming

2. Save money
