  <description>Safe Passage works with the poorest at-risk children of families working in the Guatemala City garbage dump. Within a safe and caring environment, we provide a comprehensive and integrated program that fosters hope, good health, educational achievement, self-sufficiency, self esteem and confidence.

Our primary focus is on creating opportunities and dignity through the power of education.

Safe Passage was founded in December of 1999 as a 501(c)(3)  nonprofit corporation so that many could become involved.

Since then Safe Passage has grown from educating 40 children to over 500! It represents a community comprised of children and their families living at the Guatemala City dump, a dedicated local Guatemalan staff, and caring sponsors and volunteers from Guatemala and around the world.
