  <description>Ovarian Cancer is the least known, least funded, and most deadly of all women cancers.  It kills over 85% of women who get the disease in 5 years or less.  Few find out they have the cancer before it reaches its final stages.

Because this cancer is nick-named the "whisper cancer" the symptoms seem to be those of a common cold.  The age range for this disease has been updated to before 10 years old and ranges to elderly years around 80 years.  Though it is uncommon for a child to contract this cancer, it is possible.  In 2006 only 14 children in the world had ovarian cancer under the age of 15.


This is a cause to help those in need.  All we need is some support to do it.

1. All cancers should be funded equally, not just a specific few.

2. There are more than just Breast and Cervical cancers for women.

3. Awareness.</description>
