  <description>the Foundation is dedicated to fulfilling its mission of helping children in our area as a public charity with a new, expanded focus, and we hope that you will continue to support our efforts with your generosity. Under a new name, "Garden of Dreams," the Foundation is committed to helping children in crisis in the tri-state area, whether they are suffering from devastating illness, homelessness, abuse, hunger, extreme poverty or tragedy. Garden of Dreams will work closely with all areas of Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall to build meaningful, unforgettable programs for children affiliated with local children&#8217;s hospitals, "wish" organizations; community based organizations serving children in crisis, as well as the Starlight/Starbright Foundation.
