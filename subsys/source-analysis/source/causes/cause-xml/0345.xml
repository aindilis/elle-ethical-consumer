  <description>Public land is exactly what it says it is, it belongs to the public.  So why does our government let profit making companies come in and destroy what we have left?

a snapshot of goals: habitat preservation; conservation; reduce, REUSE, recycle; leave no trace; reducing our personal and community global footprints

to be continued...

1. To fight against the destruction of our public lands at the hands of oil companies, loggers, the Bush Administration, and any others who threaten it

2. To ensure that generations to come will be able to enjoy our parks, preserves, wilderness areas, etc.

3. To lobby for the designation of new public lands

4. To support the environment in every way possible in our own lives, from biking to work or class, bringing your own to-go mug to the coffee shop, the little things count!</description>
