  <description>Warfarin is more commonly known as rat poisen. People without conscious use it to murder animals. This has to stop. Warfarin kills anything that eats it or anything that eats something that ate it slowly and painfully over the course of several weeks. How anyone can continue to use such poisen is beyond me.
