  <description>We believe that the camp environment provides invaluable life experiences, where children are given the opportunity to develop creative, athletic and social competencies.  Just as every child should have the opportunity to go to school, so too should every child be able to go to camp.  Project Campfire strongly believes in fostering positive and respectful interactions
among children, and we believe that these lessons are often learned at camp.  By giving all children the opportunity to engage in a camp experience, Project Campfire helps pave a child&#8217;s path towards success.
