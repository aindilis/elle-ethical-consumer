  <description>There are three different types of Niemann- Pick Disease, types A, B, and C.  With the diagnosis of types A, and B there is a deficiency of a specific enzyme reported with the patients.  Patients with type A experience a severe neurological disorder that leads to death by the age of 2- 4 years.  There are no treatment options for babies with type A disease.  Patients with type B often experience enlarged livers and spleens.  They may have respiratory problems, which strain the heart leading to heart disease later in life.  Patients with type B often are able to live through until their teens or early adulthood.  If type B is diagnosed early, sometimes a bone marrow transplant with help the patient.   Patients with Type C of Niemann- Pick Disease are often labelled with learning disorders and mild retardation.  There is often a delay in fine motor skills.  Many of the symptoms of type C can be controlled with medication.
