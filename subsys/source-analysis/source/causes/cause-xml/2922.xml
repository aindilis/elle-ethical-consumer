  <description>Pirates have been stereotyped, discriminated, arrested, and killed just for being pirates, don't you think that is unfair? We all understand they loot, plunder, rape, and kill. But in all reality, they are caring people that if you get to know, are really caring and sensitive. This is exactly why pirates should be embraced and we should all accept our inner pirate and let out a good ARRGGG.

1. Pirates are people just like you and me.

2. Pirating is not a crime.

3. Being a pirate does not mean you have a bird and scurvy, even though having them makes you that much cooler.</description>
