  <description>Okay, we sat around and ruined our planet for too long, we need to take action and fix the promblem we made in the first place, lower CO2 levels and save the atmosphere.little things can be done like switching to the fluresent light or buying reuseable recycleable grocery bags, to lower garbage, theres soo many things we can do, and the faster we react on this the less we deal with its concequences.

I honestly dont care if you donate, yes it would be nice, but as long as we can gett the word out there and make changes ourselves , thats what matters.

1. change everyday things to reduce greenhouse emissions

2. Lower CO2 levels in our atmosphere to reduce climate change

3. save the polars and aniamls from going extint</description>
