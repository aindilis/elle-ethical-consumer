  <description>*Despite claiming more lives than any other cancer, lung cancer receives comparatively little research funding.

*Approximately $1,723 per lung cancer death was spent in 2004 on research, compared with:
$13,953 for breast cancer
$10,318 for prostate cancer
$ 4,618 for colorectal cancer

*The Department of Defense does NOT FUND research for lung cancer, but funds research for breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, even though the former is the nation&#8217;s leading primary cancer killer.

*78 percent of doctors feel that society perceives lung cancer to be a self-inflicted disease, and that if we could remove this stigma, a majority believe patients would be more encouraged to see their doctor
