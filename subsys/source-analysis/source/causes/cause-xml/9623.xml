  <description>OK, so you are a nice Conservative that is addicted to caffeine. Correct? 

You walk into Starbuck, grab your Macciato or Latte or Frapp or whatever, sit down, and the first thing that jumps out at you is the napkins. The napkins. They scream of 'green'. And then the cups? 'How I See It'? None of those are ever NOT about saving the earth, global warming, or any other type of liberal nonsense.

Starbucks has given in to this political mindset. 

Starbucks is amazing. The atmosphere at a shop is the greatest. Just the politics are becoming too much. Starbucks Co. is allowed to think however they want. 

But don't force it on us while we're drinking the best coffee ever.

You may have noticed that any money raised from this cause goes towards Starbucks. If donations come, maybe the cash will help Starbucks think differently. 

Let's see how many people agree with me.

1. Starbucks should let customers believe how they want political-wise.

2. The viewpoints on the napkins and cups need to go.

3. Starbucks needs to quit positioning all of their capaigns and slogans towards liberal worldviews.</description>
