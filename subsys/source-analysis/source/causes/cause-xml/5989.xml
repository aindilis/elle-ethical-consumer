  <description>As a hightly industrialized nation, it is our job to provide as much emotional as well as fiscial support as possible to humanitarian associations regarding not only our country, but countries less capable as our own.

Project Africa exists for that very reason.  Everyday, Africans are dying from a disease that is easily prevented from adequet medical care.

By the year 2010, is is projected that approximately 18 million AIDS orphans. Let's do our best to shrink that number...and possibly even eliminate it.

1. Provide better living conditions for Africans that already have HIV/AIDS.

2. Provide better health care so that HIV/AIDS can be idenified at it's earliest stage.</description>
