  <description>Samaritan&#8217;s Purse is a Christian non-profit non-political humanitarian organization that works worldwide to meet the physical and spiritual needs of people suffering from war, poverty, disaster, disease, famine, and persecution. The organization&#8217;s president is Franklin Graham, son of Christian evangelist Billy Graham. 

The name of the organization is based on the biblical story of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-37), where Jesus uses an unlikely example to teach people how to love their neighbors. In the same way that the Samaritan went out of his way to care for a wounded and neglected stranger, Samaritan&#8217;s Purse offers help and hope to people in desperate and difficult circumstances.
