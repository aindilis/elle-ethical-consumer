  <description>"When people, land, and community are as one, all three members prosper; when they relate not as members but as competing interests, all three are exploited. By consulting nature as the source and measure of that membership, The Land Institute seeks to develop an agriculture that will save soil from being lost or poisoned while promoting a community life at once prosperous and enduring."

1. We must develop farming that isn't based on chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

2. We must rebuild the small farm system.

3. We should create a perennial polycultural agricultural system.</description>
