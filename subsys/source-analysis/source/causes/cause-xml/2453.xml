With the rapid growth of the Town of Cochrane, the Society has seen an exponential growth in its activities. In 2001 the shelter saw nearly 5 times as many animals come through its doors than in 1998, with 575 animals compared to 119 in 1998. To meet this increase and allow for projected future growth, the Society needs to expand the size of its physical facility. Plans are in the works for a new building.

The Cochrane Humane Society staff and volunteers strive to find loving homes for all of the animals that come into their care. They work hard at socializing the shelter animals, offering playtime for the cats on a daily basis and even teaching the dogs basic obedience and manners so that the transition into a new home is easy for everyone. The staff knows that when a well-socialized animal is placed in a good home, the result is a successful and permanent adoption.

The Cochrane community continues to demonstrate their strong support of the Society through volunteerism, sponsorship, memberships and donations of cash, food and supplies. On behalf of the animals, the shelter staff and volunteers extend a warm thank you to all who have supported them over the years.

ALL DONATIONS ARE TAX DEDUCTABLE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
