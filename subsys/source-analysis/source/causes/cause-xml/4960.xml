  <description>Breast cancer kills and I want to help stop it. I was hit hard in 204 after my friend's mom passed after being diagnosed in 2001. It hurt so bad. I don't cry in public but I just broke down and still do today thinking about it. It hurts many a families every year.

1. Women and men don't deserve to die like this.

2. Men need to be aware of it as well.

3. It hurts so many people every year.</description>
