  <description>As a public, charitable, and educational foundation the mission of the Phi Kappa Tau Foundation is to insure the philanthropic support necessary to sustain high levels of educational programming by fostering lifelong relationships and commitment to the Fraternity&#8217;s ideals.

The Foundation acquires, effectively manages, and distributes assets in order to fulfill our vision.

Currently, the Foundation distributes more than $350,000 each year to support Phi Kappa Tau. Restricted and unrestricted gifts go toward educational and character building programs, leadership development opportunities, undergraduate and graduate academic scholarships, educational grants, and philanthropic grants to the Hole in the Wall Camps. The Foundation is also the official publisher of the Laurel, Phi Kappa Tau&#8217;s award winning magazine.

The Internal Revenue Service recognizes the Phi Kappa Tau Foundation as a 501c(3) public charitable organization and gifts are tax deductible to the extent the law allows. The Foundation Board of Trustees manages the general operations of the Foundation and a professional staff oversees day-to-day activities. The asset base exceeds $10 million.
