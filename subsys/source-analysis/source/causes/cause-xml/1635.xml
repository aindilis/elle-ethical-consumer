CIS is the nation's leading community-based dropout prevention network.  Communities In Schools of San Antonio celebrates two decades of helping kids stay in school and prepare for life. 
CIS helps students stay in school and make the right choices by connecting 
schools with needed community resources. By bringing services, community 
agencies, parents, and volunteers into schools, we create 
a community of caring adults who work hand in hand with educators. 
The result: Teachers are free to teach and students can concentrate on learning. 

Through a holistic, one-on-one case management approach, CIS-SA is able to reach out to students most at-risk for dropping out of school. 
CIS-SA has helped kids to help themselves since 1985.
