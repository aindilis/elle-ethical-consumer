  <description>A sea change can return the ocean to health. Here at Ocean Conservancy, we believe it's time to look beneath the surface to see where the health of our planet really begins. It&#8217;s time to recognize the source that sustains us day to day with the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe...to discover that all living things are connected to the ocean. It&#8217;s time to understand that going green starts with living blue. It&#8217;s time to start a sea change. Won't you join us? 

1. It's Time for you to join us. Together, we can start a sea change.</description>
