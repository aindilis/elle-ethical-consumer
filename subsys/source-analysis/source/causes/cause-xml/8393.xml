  <description>Everyone should have the right to believe in whatever religion they choose or don't choose. NO ONE should be hated or descriminated against for doing so, but rather accept and respected even if it is not what you, personal, believe.

1. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs!

2. Everyone should be accepted for what they believe!

3. Religion should NOT be a reason to hate!</description>
