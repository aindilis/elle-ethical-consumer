  <description>Whether or not you believe that starting the Iraq War was the correct course of action, it was the course of action taken.  We cannot complain it away.  For better or for worse, we have invaded and removed Saddam Hussein.

The people of Iraq are in trouble, dismal chaos arguably caused by us.  We cannot leave them behind, politely saying that we're sorry for the whole thing.  We cannot take the Iraq War back.  It is our duty to help Iraq reach peace.

It won't be easy.  Peace never has been.  Peace will be.  That is our duty.

1. Continue American military support in Iraq

2. Help fund the United States armed services via donations</description>
  <mission>To raise support and funds for our armed forces aiding Iraq.</mission>
