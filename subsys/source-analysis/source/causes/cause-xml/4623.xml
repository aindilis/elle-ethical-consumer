  <description>Work toward eliminating the needless suffering of stray domestic animals by rescuing them from the streets, providing necessary healthcare, and placing them in loving and responsible homes through our active adoption program. While we are small, we can make a big difference with your help! 
Educate the public to vaccinate, spay, and neuter domestic animals, thus eliminating euthanasia as a method of animal population control. Warn the public to research the policies, procedures, and practices of any animal control facility or shelter before surrendering an animal to them. 
Provide financial assistance for responsible families who cannot afford veterinary care and promote any and all efforts to bring affordable veterinary services into our county. This would eliminate the need to transport animals to other counties for low cost spay/neuter and other veterinary services. 
Eventually provide boarding services, animal healthcare, and a home for pets whose owner(s) die or become unable to care for them at our no-kill facility. This service must be prearranged. Call us for details.
