  <description>A lot of voices claim wrongly that Copts, Orthodox or Christians are under discrimination in Egypt. The saddest part of this story is that some people believe in this, and act accordingly. They distort realities and create tensions; and at the end of the day, these same communities are the first losers of there acts.  

We are here to deliver one message: Muslims and Christians are all Egyptians. Stop lies, and search for a real cause. It&#8217;s one country, let&#8217;s unite to face ITS REAL CHALLENGES, notably erasing poverty and improving education.


1. Muslims are Christians are ALREADY equal Egyptian citizens.

2. Stop lies about discrimination.

3. It's time to face real challenges of Egypt, not imaginative ones.</description>
