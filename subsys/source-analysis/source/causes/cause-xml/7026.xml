  <description>The National Sexuality Resource Center (NSRC) is a project of the Human Sexuality Studies Program at San Francisco State University. We advance sexual literacy through science, sexuality education, and social policy formation.


1. Sexuality touches each of our lives and is essential to our well-being.

2. Sexuality is about health, intimacy, desire, and protection.

3. Sexuality is more than just the 'sex act.'

4. Sexual literacy, the knowledge needed to advance and protect one&#8217;s own sexual health and well-being, is vital.

5. Accessible information and resources are essential for healthy discussions, education, and decision-making about sexuality.</description>
