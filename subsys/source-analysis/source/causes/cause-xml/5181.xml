  <description>Hello all! As a member of The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training. I'm completing THREE MARATHONS this year in memory of my brother who lost his life in 2000 to Leukemia. We need your support to cross the ultimate finish line - a cure! 

Please make a donation to support my participation in Team In Training and help advance the Society's mission. 

I hope you'll visit my web site often. Be sure to check back frequently to see my progress. Thanks for your support!
