  <description>Domestic violence occurs in all cultures; people of all races, ethnicities, religions, and classes can be perpetrators of domestic violence. It is perpetrated by, and on, both men and women, and occurs in same-sex and opposite-sex relationships.  It has many forms, including physical violence, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, intimidation, economic deprivation or threats of violence. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control, domestic violence is a serious, preventable public health problem affecting more than 32 million Americans, or more than 10% of the U.S. population (Tjaden and Thoennes 2000).

What's more, it can be very difficult for individuals to recognize that they are even being abused, and even harder to break away from such after a sense of commitment has been established.  Therefore, education about domestic violence is necessary.

Help strive to create a community that embraces diversity, recognizes oppression, promotes empowerment, and supports the right of all individuals to self - determination.

Help victims of domestic violence and support local shelters through monetary donations or volunteer your time to help counsel or assist victims and survivors.  Contact you local shelter to see how you can help.
