  <description>I am a type one diabetic, insulin dependent for the rest of my life...or till they find a cure.  Most people dont know that this disease can be avoided by watching what you eat and keeping active with exercise.  I was diagnosed right before my 13th birthday and am going on 10 years now.  I would like to raise awareness about this so future parents will know about it, and learn to prevent it. Also I would like to try to raise money for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund

1. To help cure this disease, which is becoming a problem for today's youth

2. To inform people about this and get todays children active</description>
