  <description>I just want to give you an update on Family Life Services/ Pregnancy Counseling Center. 

Our annual Walk for Life was not as successful as we hoped or needed. We are now in fear of the future status of the pregnancy center. WE NEED HELP. We open our doors everyday to women and men who are dealing with crisis pregnancies. We offer pregnancy testing, counseling, metor programs, material goods, referral programs, teen support and sooo much more. Not to mention ALL our services are free. No hidden strings/fees attached. We help our clients see the light at the end of the dark tunnel. We make the impossible, possible. We change lives and by changing lives we save lives. However, we may lose the fight against abortion if we can't financially stay afloat. HELP US. 
Please send a donation. Even if it is a dollar. We need all the help we can get. 
Please invite as many people as possible that you think would be able to donate to us. 

We need you! Get you parents, business owners, everyone you know who can donate. We have been open almost 22 years. Please don't let the fight end here.

1. We do more than just pregnancy testing... we change lives

2. You can be the ONE person that makes a WORLD of a difference!

3. Don't just sit there... DO SOMETHING</description>
