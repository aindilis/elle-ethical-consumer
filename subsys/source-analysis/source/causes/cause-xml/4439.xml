  <description>Bugula Nerita is an animal that alot of scientists try to use to expirement with it.
Bugula Neritia has a type of blood cell that can help cure cancer.
The problem with this animal is that, if alot of scientists will use it... the population of this animal will be declining.
If they use to much of it, this will be a natural/animal disaster.
