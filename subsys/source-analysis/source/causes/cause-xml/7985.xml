  <description>Protest against Sydney Sanner Staying in Missouri because it will seriously jeopardize Josh Cates among many other Montana citizen's lives.

Sydney also stopped doing drugs, smoking cigarettes, and drinking every day when she came to Montana, we have to protest her right to be happy and healthy because she knows it wont stick if she moves back to Missouri.

1. Making Sydney Move back when she bettered her life when she came here is stupid

2. Killing hundereds of Montana teens is wrong</description>
