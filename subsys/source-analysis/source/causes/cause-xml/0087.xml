  <description>The Peru Free Trade Agreement would sanction the destruction of the Peruvian Amazon rainforest -- home to jaguars, long-haired spider monkeys, blue-headed macaws, giant river otters and other endangered species -- by failing to address the illegal harvest and trade in mahogany.

Free trade shouldn&#8217;t mean illegal trade! Send a message to your Representative and Senators urging them to reject the Peru Free Trade Agreement by visiting http://action.defenders.org

1. Help protect jaguars and other rainforest wildlife.
