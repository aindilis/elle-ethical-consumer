  <description>The Julia C. Hester House is a thriving community center in Houston&#8217;s fifth ward.  The Hester House provides a safe-haven for children, families, and senior citizens.  For 64 years we have continued in the legacy of our namesake, Julia C. Hester (a community leader and educator).  The Hester House offers a variety of social services that span the life cycle and promote social and financial independence.  From infant care, to after-school enrichment for 5-12 year olds, to our active Youth Empowerment program for teens, to adult basic education classes, to our senior enrichment program that enhances independence and quality of life for seniors, the Hester House touches every generation.

1. Children must become academically engaged early to ensure they are prepared for Kindergarten and all their subsequent years of schooling.

2. Retired senior citizens must be constantly stimulated with enriching activities.</description>
