  <description>Change A Million Light Bulbs (CAMLB) was formed in late 2006, after a short hiatus it is now back for the future in July 2007.

The idea arose out of the Youth Ambassador's Conference, as Linh Do's idea on how the world could be different.

At first glance, it may appear simple, just changing a million incandescent lights into the fluorescent kind. But, it is different. Yes, it hopes to do that. But, also more. 

CAMLB aims to educate the world, and those in it who are willing to listen about what climate change is, and how it can be prevented/slowed down. The average person doesn't care about the latest political argument of scientific research, they just want to know what and how they can help.

CAMLB is different from other campaigns, as we acknowledge we are not the only one. We are not targeting one age group, one location, one political party - but everyone. Not those that already aware, those that aren't aware.

CAMLB is the brain child of Change And Switch.
