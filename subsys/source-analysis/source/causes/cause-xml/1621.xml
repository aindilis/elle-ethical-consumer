The New York Summer Intern Program (NYSIP) was established in 1987 to provide professional opportunities for Armenians living in the United States and abroad.

Each summer, the AGBU Presidents Club (the sponsors of the Intern Program) choose 30-35 undergraduate and graduate students from around the world to participate in NYSIP. Students intern in a variety of industries, including finance media, law, international relations and the arts. Applicants must have completed their sophomore year of college to be eligible for participation. After selecting the most qualified applicants, NYSIP conducts a search of available positions and discusses options that suit the demands of each student's professional goals.

All students are housed at the New York University dormitories. The interns participate specially organized social, educational and cultural activities that highlight current and Armenian topics.
