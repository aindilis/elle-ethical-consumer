  <description>Guinea Pigs are adorable and make great companions.  They are very docile and like a person they each have a distinct personality that make them as unique as anyone else.  It is also important that people are responsible when it comes to adopting them.  At the same time they should not be seen as a delicacy for those who breed them to consume and especially used as testing subjects!!!!!

1. Other nations must recognize that Guinea Pigs should not be seen merely as food

2. Owners should be responsible for their companions and not neglect them

3. Animal Testing should be outlawed on Guinea Pigs as well as other animals, They have as much of a right to be here just as all else is</description>
