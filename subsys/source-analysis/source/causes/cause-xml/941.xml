  <description>Every five minutes someone in the United States learns that he or she has leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma &#8211; more than 300 people a day. Every ten minutes a child or adult is expected to die from blood-related cancers. This statistics represents six people every hour.
Team in Training supports The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. Since 1988, Team in Training athletes have raised more than $750 million, and we are seeing results &#8211; 25 years ago only 4% of children with leukemia survived, today 85% survive. We need to give that other 15%  that same chance at life. What if that 15% included your child or loved one? Our fight is not over! The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society is dedicated to curing leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and myeloma while improving the quality of life of patients and their families.
