  <description>All it takes is a nickle, maybe even a penny, so that we can stop the ugly hunger that has plagued one Grant "Doo Doo" Brown. With your donation, you will get up-to-date information on the the bum you will be sponsering. With some hope, and a little luck, maybe, just maybe, we can buy Grant a new shirt, or a least a pack of gum and a condom. Lets all make sure this seed doesn't spread to future generations!

1. Grant is a bum

2. He eats garbage

3. He needs to get a job</description>
