  <description>Orphanages for Africa (OFA) is dedicated to glorifying God and proving to the world that there is a personal God who hears and answers prayer.  OFA is a Christian humanitarian and development organization committed to meeting the basic needs of millions of orphaned and abandoned children across the African continent, therefore releasing them into their full potential and divine destiny.

Orphanages for Africa was founded with a donation of only $100 and since then has grown to be a non-profit corporation that is working in 5 nations all throughout Africa.  

OFA funds food, school fees, rent, clothing and supplies for African orphans. We are now beginning to establish business partnerships to assist our partners with sustainable development to help orphans.
