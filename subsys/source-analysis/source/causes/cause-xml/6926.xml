  <description>My aunt works for the Childrens Aid Society here in London and I am a student with her. She discussed this case with me and although I cannot give out details about the case I can ask anyone who sees this man to please call the proper authorities. He is abusive and neglects this child. He is a known drug user and car thief who is putting his daughter in extremely high- risk situations. His name is Christopher James Robert Miller and his 4 year-old daughter is Taylor Miller. They were last known to be in the Woodstock/London area but could be anywhere.

1. Children are not weapons

2. Children are not in control of their surroundings

3. We need to stop this kind of thing from happening</description>
