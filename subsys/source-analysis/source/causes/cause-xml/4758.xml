  <description>ninemillion.org is a UN Refugee Agency led campaign to raise awareness and funds for education and sport programs for refugee youth, many of whom are forced to spend years of their young lives away from home with little hope of returning. What happens to them now, during their years as refugees, is up to all of us.

20.8 million People are refugees. Nine million are children.

Refugees are people like you. But in many important ways they are not at all like you.

Their rights have been violated.
They have been forced to flee.
They left their homes.
They lost their family and friends.
They have nowhere to go.
They have no opportunity to learn, nor play.
They have no means by which to build a new life.

You might not be able to change the world, but you can change the world for one refugee child.

Help them learn. Help them play.
