  <description>We all know about the dangers and harms smoking has, and how it affects our health and is damaging for the people around us. 

That is why I have put up this cause to try to give people more education about the harms of smoking and  the motivation to get people to quit. 

Personally I think, and most people would agree, that smoking is a terrible and disgusting habit that reeks havoc on our health and burdens our financial freedom. Most people pick it up as a habit at a young age and find themselves addicted at a later stage because of the effects of Nicotine. 

I know it's not an easy vice to quit! That is why I have I have put up this cause to support people in their struggle to quit, share stories and motivate them further. The first advice for quitting is you that REALLY want to quit. You can rarely do it out of force or pressure from other and is a thing that you MUST really want for yourself.

1. Start improving our health and life and being conciencious to our surroundings

2. Not feed into the tobacco companies monopoly

3. Live a good, long life and cut down on cases of cancer that burdens family existence and the economy of our society</description>
