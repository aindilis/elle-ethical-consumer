  <description>Stop the mistreatment of kids, the elderly and animals. They need us to speak, and to do the work for them. Many are not aware that many elderly patients are abused by their own kids. STOP all abuse as well upon all men and women. There are many who know about the abuse, hear it every night, they hear the screams and  yells yet they ingore it. So much of society feels that its not any of there business. Lets change that with help, support  to those in need.There are many good resources out there.  Our goal is to increase awareness and to provide information, resources, and support  to those who want, and need it. As a society we need to be empathetic, we need to care. By stopping the pain  that others have to endure. Stop the heartbreak of the children who cry in the corner or under the beds, Visualize the elderly women sitting there being hit by their family members or people who are supposed to be nurturing to them. These are the same people she raised, and they now look her in the eyes and abuse her. See the sad pathetic look from the dog thin, weak and doesnt understand why someone he loves hurts him. VISUALIZE ALL THESE TEARS AND HELP STOP THE PAIN
