  <description>a group of caring, compassionate, shoppers who feel pity on us who run out of money before the stores run out of cute stuff!   ~   also, i need some cash. if you want to donate, make a check out to REBECCA DZOMBAK

1. shopping is good.

2. we (and our purses) shouldn't have to suffer unjustly due to a severe case of chronic love of shopping!

3. get each other out of debt and buy more stuff! (see, we're stuck in an endless, vicious, good looking cycle. we NEED help!)</description>
  <mission>stop all unfair treatment and persecution to those of us who can't afford our own shopping fetishes!</mission>
