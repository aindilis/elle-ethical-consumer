  <description>Food for the Hungry is an international relief and development organization that answers God&#8217;s call to meet the physical and spiritual needs of the poor in 26 countries. 

Our vision and mission is to empower students to own and end poverty. It is our hope that students will own their personal poverty and in so doing, will walk humbly in the grace of God. We believe that there are students all over the world who have a desire to end social injustice and global poverty.  FH provides these students an opportunity to put their passion to good use by getting involved with our ministry through Internships, the Go ED Study Abroad Program, as well as our College Initiatives.  Students can be involved in empowering communities around the world to fight hunger, AIDS, poverty, and social injustice!
