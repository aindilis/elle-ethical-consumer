  <description>This group is against horse slaughter.

1. Horses should never be slaughtered, however they may be euthanized if it is the most humane option.

2. Healthy horses are slaughtered because people won't take the time to look after them properly.

3. Horses have feelings and the same right to live that humans do.</description>
