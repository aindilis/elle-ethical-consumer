  <description>Did you know that 27 MILLION PEOPLE are enslaved today?

While not in the form of traditional slavery, these people are being held against their will and have been lured in by the promise of work or the fear that their families will be threatened.  Sex, labor, money, drugs...each are motives.

NOT FOR SALE (www.notforsalecampaign.com) is a movement of individuals, musicians, artists, people of faith, businesses, schools and sports teams united to stop it.

Unsure of just how prevalent modern-day slavery really is...then check out the YouTube video here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mJHkc5k5MM.
