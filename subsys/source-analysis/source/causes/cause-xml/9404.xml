  <description>When you're driving down the road and you finish a soda, don't throw it out the window...wait until you can find a garbage can.  My dad works for the MDOT and there motto is "I'm not your mama, pick it up Mississippi."  When I'm driving down the road and a friend tries to throw something out, I get a little mad because my dad could be the one picking up their mess."

1. Do not litter.
