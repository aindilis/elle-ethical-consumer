  <description>If you can learn to read and write, you can learn to do anything.

That's the idea behind CODE.

We work with local organizations throughout the developing world to empower children to learn. In so doing, we deliver an essential, sustainable development solution that endures. 

Our programs support libraries and teacher training as well as national and local book publishing in more than 17 languages in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.




1. Education is not a band-aid solution.

3. CODE is not selling poverty - we're solving it.</description>
