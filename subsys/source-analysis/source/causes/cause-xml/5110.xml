  <description>Microphthalmia: An abnormally small eye, a congenital malformation (birth defect) of the globe.

Microphthalmia may involve one or both eyes. It may occur in isolation with no associated malformations or it may be part of a multiple congenital malformation syndrome as, for example, the congenital rubella syndrome, the triploidy syndrome (due to the presence of 69 chromosomes), the trisomy 13 syndrome (Patau syndrome, due to an extra chromosome 13), and the Wolf-Hirschorn syndrome (due to deletion of part of the short arm of chromosome 4). 

When I was born in 1980, nobody knew what Micro was. Now Micro has been a big problem. Some babies carry it in their genes from their parents, and some don&#8217;t know why their babies have it. It is a scary thing to think about. My daughter Alisha has it in both eyes and sadly she is blind in both eyes.

There has been some research in London at the Moorefield Hospital. I am happy to say that they think they know what DNA is causing the Micro. 

I would love to see this Disease stop and cured. If they can cure the blind why can&#8217;t they cure Micro?

Thanks everyone for their support and donations.
