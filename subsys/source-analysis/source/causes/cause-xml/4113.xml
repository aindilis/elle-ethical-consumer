  <description>Autism is a neurological disorder that usually lasts throughout a person's lifetime. It is part of a group of disorders known as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). 1 in 150 individuals is diagnosed with autism, so it is more common than pediatric cancer, diabetes, and AIDS combined. It can happen to anyone in all racial, ethnic groups.
 It is four times more likely to strike boys than girls. Autism impairs a person's ability to communicate and relate to others. It is also associated with rigid routines and repetitive behaviors, such as obsessively arranging objects or following very specific routines. My little brother Nick is autistic, and I think it's good for other kids to be aware that this is a pretty common disorder, and not be scared or call a kid retarded if they ever come across anyone with it. Thanks!

1. Children with autism are all around, and deserve to be treated like you and I. </description>
