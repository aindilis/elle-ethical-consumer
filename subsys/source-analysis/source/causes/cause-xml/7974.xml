  <description>Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) because they cause severe inflammation of the intestinal tract, and have common symptoms. The cause remains unknown, and there is no medical cure.

The Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation of America was founded in 1967. Its mission is to raise funds: to support basic and clinical scientific research to find the cause of, and cure for, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; to provide educational programs for patients, medical and other healthcare professionals, and the general public; and to offer supportive services for patients, their families, and their friends.

1. Inform people about the disease

2. Let people share their experiences with (IBD)
