  <description>BGMC is the Assemblies of God missions program for boys and girls. Boys and girls are on a mission to help missionaries. The money raised through BGMC is used to provide our missionaries with the supplies they need to reach people around the world. BGMC equips kids to know, to care, to pray, to give, and to reach the lost. BGMC has a two-fold purpose:

   1. To reach the children of the world.
   2. To create a heart of compassion in children.


1. There is no cause greater than telling others about the love of Christ.

2. Missionaries tell others about the love of Christ.

3. Therefore missionaries need our support to be able to tell others about the love of Christ.</description>
