  <description>This cause is in remembrance of Alex Lowe, one of the best mountaineers of all time.  He made history by setting records and achieving many first ascents of mountains never before climbed.  
This is also to support his family, who must miss him terribly, and to encourage Conrad Anker, Lowe's noble best friend who has stepped into his late friend's role of fathering his family.  
Alex Lowe was a good man and a great climber, and may we always remember how he conquered the world, peak by peak.  

1. Alex Lowe's mountaineering legacy should be remembered.

2. His family needs support and prayers.</description>
