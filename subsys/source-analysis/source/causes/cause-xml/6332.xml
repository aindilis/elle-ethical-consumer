  <description>In Concacaf three and a half teams qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.  Canada has only qualified for a single World Cup.  This was over twenty years ago.  It is right time that our great nation again returns to the world biggest sporting stage.  This cause is with the idea of helping our national men's team qualify.  It this means traveling to away game in Latin America or at the very least telling your colleagues that your red and white forever its up to you, just get behind our best eleven. 

1. Must support our national men team in their goal to qualify for the 2010WC

2. Must go to any Home games in the city you live in and put those third  generation 'away' fans in their place 

3. Must believe that our national team can qualify</description>
