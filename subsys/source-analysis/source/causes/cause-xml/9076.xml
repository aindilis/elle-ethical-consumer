  <description>What&#8217;s N.I.O.F?

N.I.O.F stands for Nature Is Our Friend.  Nature is not our enemy or just something that we can ignore.  It is our friend. We care for our friends.  We give them food if they are hungry, we give them shelter if they have no where to go, we would help our friends if they were in trouble and most importantly we would not harm or kill our friends in any way.  Some people just don&#8217;t understand that nature will not always be there if we can not take care of it like a friend.  We have to save the planet from people who are destroying or hurting are friend.  If it means stopping people from polluting our beautiful oceans or destroying the majestic rainforests of South America we have to protect our friend!


1. Stop pollution of our oceans.

2. Stop the destroying the rainforests.
