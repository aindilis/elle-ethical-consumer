  <description>Theres this girl named Bobbie, and she used to live in this awesome town and she had loads of friends and she had lived there 13 years. Then she moved away to a land of corn fields and tractors. Now she is friendless and alone. Please help her raise money to fly back and see her friends!!!

1. Bobbie NEEDS TO SEE HER FRIENDS

2. SHE'LL DIE WITH OUT THEM!

3. SHE CAN'T PAY FOR A PLANE TICKET BY HERSELF</description>
