  <description>I have started this group to raise awareness at the amount of children who are in our Toronto Hospital for sick kids. Surprisingly, most of these children could be helped if the funds were available for their needs. 
"SickKids is one of the largest and most respected paediatric academic health science centres in the world. " (HFSC of T.O.)
"Close to 100,000 children come to SickKids each year for world leading care." (HFSC of T.O.)
"The Centre performs 80 per cent of all children&#8217;s heart transplants in Canada" (HFSC of T.O.)
