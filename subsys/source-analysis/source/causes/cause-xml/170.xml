  <description>Hillary Clinton was an early supporter of Net Neutrality. Unprompted, she announced her support at a time when Net Neutrality advocates really needed it. And we thank her for that.

Hillary Clinton has recently been urged by technologists to publicly state her support for making presidential debate video public --- instead of having it held hostage by big media corporations. In the age of YouTube, the little guy should be able to take debate footage and share it with friends without fear of breaking the law.

When Hillary Clinton comes out publicly for that position, we will thank her!

1. Internet freedom is important

3. The ability of the little guy to have a voice online is important</description>
