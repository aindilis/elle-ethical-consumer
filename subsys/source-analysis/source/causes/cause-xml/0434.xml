  <description>Held at the Round Rock Express Miracle League Field, children of all disabilities have the opportunity to play baseball together alongside their buddies and their fellow team mates. With a conventional field out of the question, Tracey &amp; Steve Brown, along with many other dedicated volunteers, decided to embark on creating an innovative complex that would form to the needs of the players, and their families. Games are held on Saturday mornings in the Spring and Fall, and often have night games to truly endorse the spirit of baseball.

1. The Miracle League says "no" to NO CHILD, regardless of age or disability. </description>
