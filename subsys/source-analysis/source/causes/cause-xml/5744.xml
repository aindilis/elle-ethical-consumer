  <description>The purpose of PIVE is to further immigrant parents' awareness of their rights to translation and interpretation services in New York City public schools, in order to provide greater opportunities for meaningful involvement in their children's education. Through collaboration with individual schools, PIVE holds community educational outreach events to inform parents of the availability of language access services, which enhance their ability to navigate the public school system. PIVE will also offer an ESL/Parent Leadership program, which will infuse political education and advocacy skills directly into English lessons. With the minimalization of language barriers, parents/guardians are better equipped to monitor their children's academic progress and to more effectively advocate on his or her behalf. PIVE's initiative creates a crucial step toward the success of New York City's new immigrant families and their children, whom are the first to be educated in America, through nurturing the relationship between parents and the educational process.
