  <description>The bill for amnesty is dead for now, but the fight continues. Join together and defeat the Mexican threat. The Mexican government thinks that cleaning itself up is throwing out its trash to us! We are not mexico's garbage disposal. We are Americans. We have much to be proud of, unlike them. They ruined their country and are in the process of doing what they did to their own country to us. Locally, the criminal aliens are bankrupting our Grady Hospital. You think Grady was always in such a poor shape? 

They aren't here looking for work. They are here to take our land away from us and to destroy our heritage by superimposing their own.

1. Seal the border with Mexico.

2. Protecting our sovereignty and the value of our citizenship.

3. Make English the official language of the country before the spineless politicians make Spanish and Arabic the national language.</description>
