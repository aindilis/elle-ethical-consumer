  <description>Alopecia Areata is a disease that causes partial to total hair loss in children and adults there is not a known cause or a cure for this disease. It is not life threatening but it is life altering and that is why the "Children's Alopecia Project" or "CAP", was incorporated as the only non-profit directed specifically to children with this disease. Our goal is to generate public awareness of the disease and to raise money for research and build Self-esteem via support group participation for children and their parents.
