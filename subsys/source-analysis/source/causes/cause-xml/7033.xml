  <description>Dolphins like the bottlenose and orcas(A.K.A killer whales) are famous attractions at marine parks but their life behind the show are extremely cruel.They are taken from the wild,seperated from their family and pod, from 2 to 6 years old.The only food they get is when they do their tricks which is barely anything.Help stop this cruelty and join this cause!

1. Anyone who knows Miami Seaquarium's Lolita will know that her life as a slave to entertainment is wrong.

2. One marine park had atleast 1 performing animal die every month for 2 years and the public didnt know about it.

3. These animals didn't grow on trees or fall from the sky!They were babies from the wild and had a painful capture.</description>
