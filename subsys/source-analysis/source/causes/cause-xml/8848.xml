  <description>Carla is in the middle of a custody battle with her soon to be ex husband, who she once trusted. She trusted him while Adia was visiting for a little while in Arkansas, but while she was there, he filed for divorce and is now trying for custody of their daughter. Carla has missed Adia's first steps, her first teeth coming in, and a lot more. She is not living in the healthiest of conditions right now. Adia has lived with Carla for the first 7 months of her life and took full responsibility and care, while he gave little or no help. Carla must now battle to get her daughter back and we all know it is not cheap. Please help. Every bit helps.
