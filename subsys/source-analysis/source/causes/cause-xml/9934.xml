  <description>- Pornography was involved in the sexual abuse of 87% of female children and 77% of male children 

-..."non-aggressive" pornography (pornography prominently available in mainstream market), that which excludes rape and violence but graphically depicts all other forms of sex (group, homosexual, switching, anal, oral, etc.) was found to:

-desensitize the viewers to the material's breaking of sexual taboos, causing the viewers to become more accepting of it and much less concerned about its negative effects; 
-cause the viewers to regard rape as a more trivial offense, with men particularly showing major increases of sexual callousness toward women; 
-increase the viewers' loss of compassion for women as rape victims. In a sense, then, this kind of pornography as male entertainment promotes the victimization of women.


1. To raise public awareness of pornography's content, pervasiveness, and victimizations of people.

2. To motivate citizens to raise their voice for the health and safety of children, women, and men.

3. To work for changes in laws and procedures which would provide regulation and control of pornography.</description>
