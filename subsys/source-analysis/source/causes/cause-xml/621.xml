  <description>AfricAid is a nonprofit organization that supports girls&#8217; education in Africa in order to provide young women with the opportunity to transform their own lives and the futures of their communities. We believe that, through education, these young women will be able to obtain greater standing in their national government and have a say in their own future and the futures of their communities. Also, we believe that education provides the tools needed to combat the challenges created by poverty, and that young women will be likely to go back to their communities and teach their friends and family what they have learned at school. AfricAid relies on contributions in order to grant scholarships and provide supplies, textbooks, buildings etc.
