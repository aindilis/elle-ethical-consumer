  <description>We support the on-going search for replacements for petroleum in the coming decades and realize its importance to the survival of our current civilization. Clean alternative fuels, along with conservation, will not only free us of the bonds of ever-dwindling oil supplies, but help clean up our environment and solve climate problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels.

Alternative fuels must become more than just alternatives - they must become full replacements. And the sooner, the better.

1. Oil is a finite, non-renewable resource.

2. Alternative fuels must take petroleum's place in all aspects of its use.

3. Clean, low-polluting alternatives are always favored.

4. Spreading public and governmental awareness of the problem is the first step towards the solution.</description>
