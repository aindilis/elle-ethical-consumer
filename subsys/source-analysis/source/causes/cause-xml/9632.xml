  <description>In June, one of our dearest friends married the love of her life.  To honor this beautiful wedding, and the generous spirit of the bride and groom, we are going to give a gift that keeps on giving.

Our gift is to raise US$8,000, every penny of which will go to the digging and construction of a freshwater well in Pader, Uganda.

By building just 1 well, we can give approximately 1000 people access to clean water for the next 15 - 20 years.

WHY WATER?  	   	   	    

Because.  Because 1.1 BILLION people in the world do not have access to clean, safe drinking water.

Unsafe water and lack of basic sanitation causes 80% of all sickness and disease, and kills more people every year than all forms of violence, including war. 

Many people in the developing world, usually women and children, walk more than three hours every day to fetch water that is likely to make them sick. Those hours are crucial, preventing many from working or attending school. 

Additionally, collecting water puts them at greater risk of sexual harassment and assault. Children are especially vulnerable to the consequences of unsafe water.

Of the 42,000 deaths that occur every week from unsafe water and a lack of basic sanitation, 90% are children under 5 years old

1. Access to clean water is a fundamental Human Right.  </description>
