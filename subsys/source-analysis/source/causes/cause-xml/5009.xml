  <description>Over fishing is one of the biggest environmental problems of today. 

Our oceans belong to everyone. Most fish, like tuna, travel huge distances underwater and can&#8217;t be protected by one country alone. 

Over fishing can be described in the most simple terms as a situation where one or more fish stocks is being fished at a greater rate than the fish stocks can reproduce. This basically leads to depletion of fish stocks. 

According to a Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimate, over 70% of the world&#8217;s fish species are either fully exploited or depleted.

The threat of over fishing is not limited to the target species either. Bottom Trawlers are forced to resort to scraping the seafloor deeper than before. This not only means that they are catching all sorts of un-needed bycatch, but also that they are disturbing deep-sea ecosystems and the fish that inhabit them. 

FAO estimates that Worldwide, fisheries throw away 25% of their catch. Sometimes fish are discarded because they have no market value, or the fishermen don&#8217;t have the proper permits to land them.

1. Sustainable seafood choices must be made immediately
