  <description>Our values are Jesus, Justice and Technology.  Our mission is to support Christian organizations in using technology to transform vulnerable communities.  TechMission provides services to members of the TechMission Network through four programs: the Association of Christian Community Computer Centers (AC4), Safe Families, ChristianVolunteering.org and UrbanMinistry.org. These programs support members through three program areas: training, resources and community building.  

1. Transforming communities through innovation.

2. Connecting communities for social justice.

3. Bringing technology to urban ministries, youth workers, churches and Christian non-profits through online volunteer matching, community technology and computer centers.</description>
