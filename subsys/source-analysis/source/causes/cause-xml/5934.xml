  <description>All life depends on water.  It is the fluid that creates life.  Only with clean water can the earth support life.  Water is life.  

This cause is dedicated to protecting fresh water resources for future generations.  Not just for human consumption, but to support all living creatures that depend on these ecosystems.  

Ocean waters, though not consumed by humans, also need out support.  They are dumping grounds for our waste.  This must change.  We must realize our responsibility to care for the earth.  

The earth will live on without us, but we will not live on, without the earth.
