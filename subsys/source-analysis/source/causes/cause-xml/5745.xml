  <description>The Disclosure Project is a nonprofit research project working to fully disclose the facts about UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence, and classified advanced energy and propulsion systems. We have over 400 government, military, and intelligence community witnesses testifying to their direct, personal, first hand experience with UFOs, ETs, ET technology, and the cover-up that keeps this information secret. 

1. Governments must disclose the information about Extraterrestrails 

2. Governments must disclose information about free energy and zero point propulsion systems</description>
