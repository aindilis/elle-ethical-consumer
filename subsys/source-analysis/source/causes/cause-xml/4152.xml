  <description>Everyone who join this should donate $1.00. With 50 people, that should get Nik two discs, which he both lost. In reality, he just go spend his money to do this, but I am nice. =)

1. Everyone deserves a disc.

2. Everyone descerves to be happy.

3. Everyone deserves a second chance.</description>
