  <description>Tiny Stars is a non-government agency dedicated to working with US Federal Law Enforcement to gather evidence of international extreme human rights abuses. Tiny Stars is a 501(c)3 agency.

Objectives:

Raise $60,000 salaries for hundreds of full time agents. All agents are hired directly through Covert Intelligence Service (CIS). 

Covert Intelligence Service (CIS) employs former field officers from CIA, NSA, Interpol, KGB, SFOD-D (Delta Force) and other international intelligence agencies. Agents are assigned to international cases of extreme human rights abuse committed by American citizens. Working directly with US Federal Agencies CIS has created a one-off system that has been instrumental in many extreme abuse cases around the world. 

A unique funding model allows private citizens to pay to be trained by elite operatives. CIS hosts trainings in exotic locations around the world. For $10,000 anyone can be trained by former CIA operatives. For another $90,000 clients travel with agents aboard a private jet in Bond/Bourne style but on a live and very real mission. Tiny Stars' mission is to hire as many agents as possible to work full time for our organization to create an active response rather than advocacy or educational response.
