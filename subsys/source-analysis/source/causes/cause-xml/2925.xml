  <description>In essence the amount of effort governments everywhere put into the conservation of lands largely used by wildlife and fona is extremely insufficient.  The world is being gobbled up by corporatations and industries who care nothing more than lining their pockets.  Not only would privatisation of conservation give the individual a chance to make a difference, but it would also show the government that not taking full steps to ensure the future of our lands will indefinitly lead to the ruin of life on this planet as we know it.  

1. The world belongs to ALL living things.

2. Many individual efforts can lead to a big change.

3. All life on the planet is linked, whether we (humans) like it or not.</description>
