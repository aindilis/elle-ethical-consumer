  <description>Food &amp; Water Watch is a non-profit organization that advocates for common sense policies that will result in healthy, safe food and access to safe and affordable drinking water. Everyone is dependent on shared resources like clean water, safe food and healthy oceans. It&#8217;s essential that these shared resources be regulated in the public interest rather than for private gain.

Our staff, located in 12 offices in the United States, works with a range of constituencies to inform and hold policymakers accountable. Our international staff in Latin America and the European Union (where we are known as Food &amp; Water Europe) work with coalition partners to track the global impact of U.S. corporations on public policy.


1. We are a public interest organization that remains independent of corporate and government influence.

2. We are funded fully through our members, individual donors, and foundation grants.</description>
