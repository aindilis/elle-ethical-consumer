  <description>Dear all, while browsing facebook groups, and my aim was to see different groups of people, but sadly and with extreme sorrow I have found some groups whom are racist groups, against Islam and Muslims.

It is extremely sad to find such people whom I think they only work on that reason in their lives.

The story doesn't end here, they post the photos that insult our religion.

I pray to God that those people would wake up and stop  doing those acts, or they would just vanish away from facebook.

So for that reason I have created this cause which I want it to reach the maximum number of members, and hopefully our voice will be heard by FACEBOOK, and more control will occur.

A message to those people who insult Islam and Muslims 

"don't worry we are all united, and it just keeps us stronger and stronger and stronger"

and someday you all are going to regret saying a single letter against Islam and Muslims.

Peace to all.

1. Stopping people whom are against Islam from creating groups to insult Islam and Muslims

2. Asking Facebook to show more control over such groups and take the necessary actions.</description>
