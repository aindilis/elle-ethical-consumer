  <description>Our world is deteriorating each day and people care less. The news continue to show Irak and Middle East as the problems of the world and Latinamerica are a vague memory.  The problems in Africa have been adressed at the UN and elsewhere (media, etc) but so far the situation continues to worsen each day. No one has been able to provide change for the oldest continent in the world. Sudan is currently one of  the poorest country in the world. More recently they are undergoing an internal conflict...The UN has tried but the political differences between major powers have not enabled the help Sudan is in imminent need!
