  <description>STFU stands for "Silence Toward Full Understanding".

In our day-to-day lives we experience others whose mission in life is to emit the maximum number of words possible, without regard for the value of the space in between words -- blessed silence.   That silence allows us time to grasp the meanings of the words and to gain understanding from them.  We therefore encourage people to simply stop talking so much.

1. Understanding is gained through silence.

2. Harmony is gained through silence.

3. Peace is gained through silence.</description>
