  <description>Slightly more than 25 percent of the Sderot's 3,000 school pupils showed up for classes Monday, after the schools had been shut down for a week because of heavy rocket firing on the Negev city. In some classes, no lessons were held because teachers stayed away. At least 11 rockets struck the area Monday. 

Sderot Mayor Eli Moyal asked Education Minister Yuli Tamir (Labor) on Sunday to declare an early end to the school year, with the lost time to made up in August. However, she rejected the request, stating that "there will be no benefit if the pupils sit in an unprotected home, bored and frightened."
