  <description>In the begining there was Kasol....then these firangs came and discovered the goods and good stuff....later the firangs were reduced to a group of fearful and kanjooz ppl who tried to keep the goods and good stuff away from the shanti ppl
Now we must take the power back so shanti can unite with Kasol and Kasol is freed!



1. Kasol belongs to shanti ppl</description>
