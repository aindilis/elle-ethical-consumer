1. Autism is a treatable condition. Many children benefit from both biomedical and early intervention services.

2. Autism is not a life-sentence and the children affected by it have individual needs that need to be addressed.

3. This diagnosis is not a prognosis or sentence on your child. They are an individual and need to have their needs met. </description>
