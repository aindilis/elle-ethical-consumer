  <description>Elderly drivers over the age of 75 are almost as likely as young adults up to the age of 24 to be in an accident, and ultimately to be the cause of a vehicular accident.  We propose that drivers be tested more rigorously after the age of 74 if they wish to maintain a driver's license.  In addition to saving lives, and decreasing property loss, this organization hopes to improve the environment by removing dangerous drivers from the road, and forcing them to use public transport systems, and decreasing insurance rates as a result of a 25-30% reduction in traffic accidents nationwide.

1. All drivers should be properly tested

2. All drivers should respect the safety of others.

3. No matter what your age, you should know when you cannot be behind the wheel.</description>
