  <description>CHF International has designed fuel-efficient stoves for women in refugee camps in Darfur. They use the pots already provided by the refugee camps and increase fuel efficiency by 75%. This is helpful, because fuel is even more scarce than food in Darfur and even when they have food, families have been known to skip meals simply because they do not have the fuel to cook it. As well, the search for fuel takes women far from their living spaces, leaving them vulnerable to rape, etc. Women often go to get the fuel simply because the men will be murdered, whereas women will be raped, but often let to live. Thus, the stove project is a realistic way to help women and families in Darfur. For every $30, a stove can be purchased.

In order to get money for charity, I save change. I save all the change I get for an entire year, and then I give it all to various charities at the end of the year. It ends in a hefty chunk! You guys might try it and adapt it for yourselves.
