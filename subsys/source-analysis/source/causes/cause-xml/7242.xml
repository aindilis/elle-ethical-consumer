  <description>only being alive 15 years, ive experienced more death than many people do in a lifetime.  most of which are suicide.  my grandfather commited suicide when he found my grandmother had someone on the side. Took one to the head. My best friend of two years, Darius, commited suicide when his father died. He hung himself in his closet.  Lastly, someone i didnt know personally, but still touched me, was kevinking.  he went to the school that i now attend and cause of death: suicide. He, too, took one to the head. why are so many teens and even adults commiting suicide?  even if you dont donate any money, join this cause to try and raise awareness on this growing issue.

1. God gave you life. Don't throw it away.</description>
