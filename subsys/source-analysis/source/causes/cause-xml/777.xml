*Statistics show that one in five children will grow up to develop skin cancer
* Skin cancer is the fastest growing cancer
* Melanoma is the #1 cancer killer of young women 25-29 years old
* Skin cancer is 95% preventable

On a personal level, my father died from melanoma at the age of 49. I've tried my best to educate others around me but only a dedicated organization can raise awareness on a national level.

I believe the Shade Foundation (also known as the CURT AND SHONDA SCHILLING MELANOMA FOUNDATION OF AMERICA) is doing a phenomenal job getting the word out there through its programs and sponsored events.
