  <description>Spina bifida is a leading birth defect occurring in 1 in 1000 births in the U.S.  It is an incomplete closure in the spinal column oftentimes leading to paralysis, as well as bladder and bowel problems.  

Hydrocephalus is often associated with spina bifida.  Hydrocephalus is a buildup of cerebral spinal fluid around the brain that has to be surgically corrected with the insertion of a shunt into the brain allowing the excess fluid to be drained into the abdominal cavity or, in some cases, the space around the heart.

With these conditions comes a financial burden for the families who need to care for their family members dealing with these conditions.  Crutches and wheelchairs need to be purchased so those with spina bifida can have the mobility so many people take for granted.  

The goal of this cause is to help those dealing with these conditions.  If you can help, it is greatly appreciated.
