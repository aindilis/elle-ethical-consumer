  <description>It's hard for military families to make it on such small paychecks. Recently, they cut military funding, making pay go even lower than it was. Even with living on base housing, families can barely afford food for themselves. Most wives have said they starve themself in order to feed their kids while they're husbands are overseas, and they make the most money being deployed. Something needs to be done.
