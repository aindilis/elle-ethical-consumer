  <description>The National Breast Cancer Foundation was founded by breast cancer survivor Janelle Hail, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1980 at the age of 34. As a result of early detection, she survived the disease and has devoted her life to educate women about early detection and provide free mammograms for women who could not afford them.
