  <description>Our strategy is to create jobs, stimulate small businesses, and strengthen communities among the poor.  Our method is to work through indigenous partner organizations that provide small business loans, training, and counsel. Our commitment is motivated by Jesus Christ's call to serve the poor. Our core values are respect, commitment to the poor, integrity, and stewardship.

1. Poverty and powerlessness are an offence to God and a denial of his loving provision for his creatures</description>
  <mission>Our mission is to provide opportunities for people in chronic poverty to transform their lives.</mission>
