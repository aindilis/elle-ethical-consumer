  <description>The victims of violence who cannot speak for themselves need our help.  They are babies who haven't had the opportunity the test their language skills, the children of abuse who cannot speak.

These victims suffer in silence, not by choice but because they have no other option.

Children who have been abused at young ages will suffer for the rest of their lives and will probably never fully recover, but they can be helped.

1. Everybody should be treated with respect.

2. Human decency is a right not an privilebge.</description>
