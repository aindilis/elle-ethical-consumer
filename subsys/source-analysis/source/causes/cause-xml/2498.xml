  <description>The world is a crumbling place. Stupid people spawn on the greasy, mold ridden floors of public restrooms and locker rooms, while those with brains are forced to pander to these dolts.

The only way we can save our planet from becoming some idiot run mockery of its' former glory is by appointing someone who can rule the world with a just and clever hand.

We believe that person to be Brenden Kirch.

1. There are too many stupid people.

2. They must be crushed!

3. The world would be better off if everyone shut up and listened to Brenden.</description>
