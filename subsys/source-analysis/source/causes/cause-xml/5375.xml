  <description>Jahindepad, a purple giraffe from Wisconsin is in need of assisstance crossing the road, after escaping the Wisconsin Metro Zoo because hes food tasted like crap. He is in need of assisstance because he believes that their are many potential problems on the road ahead such as: speeding cars, poachers, the zoo people in search of him, etc. With your kind and generous help, we can aid this poor giraffe cross the road, escape the crappy zoo food, and help him rejoin his purple giraffe like family.

        Please, feel free to add any suggestions that might help Jahindepad cross the road:

1. Jahindepad must find a way to cross the road.

2. Zoo food is really bad...trust us.

3. He's family needs him...not the zoo.</description>
