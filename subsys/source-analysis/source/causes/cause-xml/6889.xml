  <description>Ignite Florida is a youth run (ages 14-25) anti-tobacco activism organization. We take the fight against the tobacco industry to the next level by holding our public officials accountable for their actions relating to tobacco. along with combating the industry directly.

We are not anti-smoking, we just want the truth.

1. The tobacco industry has manipulated and deceived the American people for decades about smoking.

2. Our public officials' jobs are to work in the interest of their constituents, not an industry who funds their campaign war-chest while killing thousands with their product.

3. Public leaders need to work with anti-tobacco activists to hold the tobacco industry accountable.</description>
