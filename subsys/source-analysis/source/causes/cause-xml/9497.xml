  <description>The best way to describe what we're up against: The secular-progressive media has created "a touchy-feely vision of our society that places individual self-expression and rights over self-sacrifice and adult responsibility." 

Citizens of the United States need to take responsibility NOW for the past, present, and future for every action taken and word spoken!

We've become a tolerant and shameless society. When did premarital pregnancy become normal? When did discipline in child rearing become "child abuse?" When did degrading lyrics become "cool?" When did shows like Desperate Housewives, Sex and the City, and Grey's Anatomy become perfectly acceptable for children to watch? These things are NOT OK. 

This isn't about your political or religious beliefs. This is about PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY. 
       

1. The traditional American family set-up must be restored.

2. Let's get back to working hard, saving, and spending wisely.

3. Hardcore criminals have little or no "rights," nor do young children know what's best for them. 

4. Most importantly, Americans adults must take RESPONSIBILITY. </description>
