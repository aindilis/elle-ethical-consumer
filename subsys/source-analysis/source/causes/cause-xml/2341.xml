  <description>This is cause is for help and support for those who have suffered or has a loved one who has suffered from lung cancer. I created this cause when my grand mother found out she had lung cancer, so it made me realize how badly they need to find a cause. A little over a year ago she passed away due to this. Its a very hard thing to watch someone go through and i only hope and pray that one day they will find a cure. I want to leave a reminder that i am here for anyone who needs someone to talk to as i have been down that road and understand and know how hard this is, so feel free to msg me anytime. Thank you everyone for your support.
