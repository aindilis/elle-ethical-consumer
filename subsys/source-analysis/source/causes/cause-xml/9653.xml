  <description>Tonight at 6:05pm (MN time)  The I35W Bridge connecting St. Paul and Minn., MN collapsed causing so far 6 people dead and at least 30 cars in the mississippi river. The twin cities Red Cross is collecting donations since the bridge will need rebuilding. I didnt really know if anyone is interested in donating but since i knew quite a few people in MN that are effected by this disaster if you want to donate some money to this cause you can contact Twin Cities Red Cross. I know there was a school bus with children ranging from 4 to 14 years old (who did make it) but 10 out of the 60 were sent to the hospitals. I know that it is greatly appriciated if anyone wants to take a few bucks to help with this disaster! No cause on the reason for the collapsing but the bridge was inspected last in 06' and was up to date on structure! If you think of how many bridges there are in our country and how many couldve been your own homes bridge how much you would respect those who care through out the country to donate and help rebuild! Think of how shocking this is and how likely next time it could be your own bridge!

1. Money is limited and will get tight for the Community of St. Paul/Minn. MN</description>
