  <description>Paws for a Cause is the largest campaign in support of animals in BC!

Join us on September 14, 2008 to help raise $750,000 for animals in need.  Register today!

Last year 10,000 campaigners in 37 communities across the province raised $680,000. This year we're trying to do even better, but we need your help! 

It starts on June 1 and it peaks on September 14 when 37 communities across the province Walk for the Animals. 

Funds raised through Paws for a Cause stay in local communities to help animals in need.
