  <description>This group is not a god (no matter which god u believe in; from Zues to "God") hating or christian, muslim, jewish, budist etc... hating group.  

I simply created this cause to have a place to have EDUCATED dicussion on views of religion.

With this said, I welcome all persons, believers and non-believers alike to join in on discussion.

Feel free to express your views as you feel but do not be offended when someone else challenges your beliefs, because that is one charaterisitic of a bigot.

Have fun!!!

P.S. this group is mainly a non-believer one so there will obviously be a bias in the groups intentions.

1. Religion preaches tolerance but teaches intolerance

2. Religion is not 100% bad, it has done many good for our society but i feel as though the negatives out way the positives.</description>
