  <description>One of the core passions and values of Mars Hill Graduate School is to integrate the study of
text, soul, and culture throughout our curriculum.  Learning this integration well, we believe, leads us to understand not only where our deepest passions lie, but perhaps gives us some clues in what what to do about them.  We believe true change starts with knowing yourself well and looking out from there.

To that end, many of our students and alumni are stirred to ask questions about how Christians and churches around the world are engaging with issues such as domestic violence, sexual trafficking, care for the environment, disease and poverty.

Beautiful and creative dreams are seeding and blossoming...and we'd love to have you be a part of the journey!

1. Local churches are an essential force for good in local communities all over the world.

2. Psychotherapy is more than a feel good luxury - it is an amazing opportunity to name your own lust and anger, on a journey toward loving God and others in ways you never imagined.

3. Awareness of, and engagement in, social justice issues should be at the forefront of every local church and Christan agenda.</description>
