  <description>Whether you are a male, female or transgender, anorexic, bulimic, compulsive overeater, disordered eater, not eating disordered at all, whether you are 12 or 112, black, white, purple, or polka dotted....whether you have pointy breasts, small muscles, wide hips, or your second toe is longer than your big toe, you deserve to love your body and treat it with adoration, respect, and pampering. 

This cause is for anyone who has stood in front of a mirror, store window or reflective surface and wished that what shone back at them could be altered in some way.

Raise awareness to all of the thigns that our bodies do for us every day that allow us to live full, productive, beautiful, amazing, loving, sometimes glamorous and glorious lives. 

Love your body

Love your self

And help others do the same


Remember
