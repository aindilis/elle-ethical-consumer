  <description>There are less than 2,000 of the Florida Manatee left, and that number is decreasing every year.  The reason for all the manatee deaths are:
 
Human Impact - People in power boats cause lots of trouble for manatees. 

Habitat Loss - Humans are getting on manatees' turf.
 
Disease - If the water's too cold, manatees get sick.
 
Pollution - "Would you like to swim in polluted water?"

So Help To Save Them!  It's estimated they only have 10 years left! 


1. We must do abetter job protecting the manatees

2. Most of their deaths are from human impact.....which WE can obviously prevent

3. They only have about 10 years left if something isn't done. </description>
