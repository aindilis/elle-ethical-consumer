  <description>Haven Acres Cat Sanctuary was established in 2003 by three individuals driven by a strong desire to help the many stray, feral, and unwanted cats in Alachua County. The sanctuary is located in High Springs, Florida, which is about 20 minutes outside of Gainesville, Florida.

Cats that live at the sanctuary are kept on a healthy diet (Science Diet) and are provided with safe, secure housing. Along with being spayed/neutered they are also provided with any other medical attention needed. Many of the cats are adoptable and wait for a forever home to come get them. Cats that are less adoptable due to age, temperment, or color have a safe, loving home at the sanctuary for the rest of their lives.
