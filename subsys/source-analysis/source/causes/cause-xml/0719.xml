  <description>Our full mission is to develop and sustain a grassroots constituency that uses the political process to guarantee every woman the right to make personal decisions regarding the full range of reproductive choices, including preventing unintended pregnancy, bearing healthy children and choosing safe, legal, accessible abortion.

In the face of severe national threats to our right to choose, NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts is working on many fronts to protect reproductive freedom - in elections, at the State House, at the community level, and in the media. We will need you to stand with us in the coming months as we fight restrictions proposed at the State House, work to pass pro-active Prevention First legislation, build an active and vocal pro-choice base, and win in the 2008 elections.
 
NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts is leading the fight for choice on behalf of the women and families of the Commonwealth. With more than 20,000 members throughout the state, our pro-choice constituency is strong.
