  <description>Since 1966, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation has been the voice of those who care about restoring North America's largest estuary. Our motto "Save the Bay" has defined that mission to the 16 million people who live in the 6 state Chesapeake Bay Watershed. CBF is the largest and only independent, Bay-wide organization that exists solely to restore and protect the vitality of the Bay.
