  <description>MicroMentor makes it easy for Rashida and Pamela to connect.

Rashida is a sculptor from New Orleans seeking to expand her business beyond craft fair sales.

Pamela is executive director of a business development organization in Rochester, NY with experience in business planning and marketing strategy.

Rashida fills out a profile on the MicroMentor site and then posts questions or requests a mentor around her business development and marketing issues. 

If these are a good fit for Pamela, we do everything we can to put them in touch. 

We send Pam a notice that she has a potential match, and we make it easy for her to find Rashida's profile on the site and contact her directly (Rashida can do the same).

We provide customer service and added support where it&#8217;s needed and we encourage participants to give us feedback on their interactions on the site, which helps us constantly improve.
