  <description>For too long short people, often labeled as midgets have been a victim of objects being out of reach, this is due to the fact they are indeed too short too reach them. It's statistically proven that 92% of midgets feel the scorching burn of humiliation in a supermarket at least three times in their lives. According to Harvard studies, this decreases life expectancy by 10 years and increases rates of depression, suicide, and psychological stress. We believe that midgets should not face the sting of the cold reality of their size and they should be provided with the remedy of their affliction, a simple step ladder.

According to a study at Seton Hall, with the factor of a step ladder placed into their lives, there have been higher mortality rates among midgets. They have also been shown to be more productive and lead happier lives. We must act swift and help God's little punch lines...

1. Small people should be treated equally.

2. Small people should be given step ladders.

3. Lil' Bush should be taken off the air... Is he worse now that he is lil?</description>
