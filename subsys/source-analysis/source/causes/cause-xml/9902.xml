  <description>In the August 6, 2007 issue of Newsweek, the cover story really caught my eye. "Slaughter in the Jungle" was the heading of this story. According to the article,   gorilla's are now facing extinction because of these cruel acts that are happening in the Congo. A week before to the article, as desribed in a caption one of the pictures, the alpha male of a gorilla family was massacred which threatens the family's unity. "There are only 720 mountain gorillas sill alive today." said the caption of the first pictur in the article. I belive it's time we prevent this majestic beast from reaching the point of extinction. Something must be done. 

1. The massacre of gorillas must stop.

2. Prevent gorilla extinction.</description>
