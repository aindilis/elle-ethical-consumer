  <description>Each and every day millions of people walk by , down and through trash covered streets, beaches and neighbourhoods . If each of us stopped and picked up as little as 2 peices of trash a day our world would be a better place.  WE CAN DO IT !

1. ITS IN THE BIBLE , THOSE WHO RUIN THE EARTH WILL THEY THEMSELVES BE RUINED

2. OUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO LIVE IN A DISGUSTING WORLD FILLED WITH LITTER

3. OUR ENVIROMENT IS SUFFERING BECAUSE OF OUR LAZINESS

4. WE WILL FEEL AS THOUGH WE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING WITH INSTANT GRADIFICATIONS

5. WE WILL SEE A DIFFERENCE AND APPRECIATE THE CHANGE</description>
