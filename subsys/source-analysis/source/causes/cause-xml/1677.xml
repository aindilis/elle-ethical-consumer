Please keep an eye out for Mugoddai, a neutered male black cat that went missing from the Takoma Park, MD area two weeks after moving there.  Mugoddai is ten years old.  He is a domestic short haired/Siamese mix.  Pointed Siamese face, light green eyes, black nose and whiskers.  Small white wisp at throat.  White hairs in ears, a few at belly.  One chipped top incisor.  Very small bald mark at nape of neck under fur.  Might have tried to get back to Arlington, VA.  Might come to you as a rescue, a stray, or a surrendered pet.  Please contact pet parent, at Mugoddai@verizon.net.  Missing since December 11, 2003.  Pictures on website www.mugoddai.com 
Loved and very much missed.  Thank you.
