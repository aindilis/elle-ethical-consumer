  <description>the point of this group is NOT to be hateful to homosexuals. i do not hate them and God definitely doesn't! 


the dictionary says that marriage is the legal union of a man and woman as husband and wife. 

the Bible says, "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable." Leviticus 18:22. 

"Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; Neither the sexually immoral nor the idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitues nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God." 
1 Corinthians 6:9-11.

"Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator&#8212;who is forever praised. Amen. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion." Romans 1:24-27.
