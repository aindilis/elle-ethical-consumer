  <description>basically the point is to just show that u support the men and women overseas. dont donate or do anything just join and say it. i plan on joining the military and going to fight when i turn 18 and i hope to have the support of the people i love back home and im sure the current soldirs want the same. if you know someone who is in the armed forces or plans to be, please send this cause to them.
