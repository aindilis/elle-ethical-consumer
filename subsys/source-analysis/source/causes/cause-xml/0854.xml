  <description>We recognize that America needs to cut out the government red tape and allow companies to build oil refineries with ease once again.

No new refineries have been built in the U.S. in the past 25 years and this is a key reason for the high gas prices we currently face. Yes, high prices for oil contribute, but if we could simply refine more gasoline we would see a significant gas price reduction. The reason is that we simply cannot refine enough gasoline to meet demand at present. Thus, via the laws of supply and demand, gas costs more. Our limited refining ability particularly becomes a problem when something goes wrong that shuts down refining ability at one or more refineries as we saw in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

We advocate building the first new oil refinery in America in 25 years because we recognize that only tackling the root causes of the problem -- not schemes to boycott gas for a day or boycott the biggest oil companies -- is what is really going to finally bring some gas price relief.

1. Government regulations need to be eased to allow companies to build new oil refineries in America

2. The lack of construction of new refineries in the last 30 years is a significiant contributor to the rising gas prices

3. America will be better off if we cut out the government red tape and allow companies to build to meet our demand</description>
