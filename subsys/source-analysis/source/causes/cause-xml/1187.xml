  <description>Incredi-bulls for Adoption
MABBR's mission is to rescue great bully breed ambassadors and place them for adoption. Candidate MABBR dogs are selected from animal shelters across the Midwest. After evaluation and vetting, dogs are either fostered or boarded until their forever families are found.

Welcome! MABBR was created by a group of bully breed enthusiasts to save these delightful but often misunderstood dogs. Not only does MABBR rescue and find homes for homeless bull breeds such as American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, American Bulldogs, Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, Bull Mastiffs, mixed breeds, and other Mollasser-type dogs, MABBR also focuses on education, outreach, and assisting cities with drafting safer and more effective breed-neutral dangerous dog laws.

1. Pit bull dogs are just dogs, nothing more, nothing less.

2. Until there are none, rescue one! 

3. Dangerous dogs are not defined by breed, they're defined by behavior.</description>
