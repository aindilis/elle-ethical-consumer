  <description>I do not wish to achieve every thing that needs to be done, for the cause, just by the means of this small cause on facebook. but than again saving even one human life is a great cause, with immeasurable magnitude. Just think if the money you provide out of your flexible budget can help prevent HIV from spreading. It can save a life in a community where 25% of the population is living and breeding with HIV and spending their life in a terrible illness only to wait for a painful death. with a life expactancy of 39 for all the population; however the people infected from birth are very lucky just to see their late teenage.
even if there is not enough donation, i would still be happy to make people aware of how HIV affects peoples lives and show the immensity of the problem. a person infected with HIV lives for 10-12 years; after that time the desease matures into AIDS after this point a person infected will live with all the illnesses accquired during their lives and becomes the cause of their death. the immune system is comepletely oblitarated against any or all illnesses. if a person infected catches a flu they will remain in the sickness till the time death knocks on their door.
Please join the cause and be a part of something that will save lives sooner or later. make as many people aware and spread the word. remember one man can make a lot of difference, just think how much difference many people can make!
