  <description>Well in many places throughout the nation (US) school districts are cutting funding and other forms of support to the fine arts and music programs. As well all know that there are countless studies out there that show that the average intelligence of a student of music is greater than the one without. I don't want  you to donate money, but I do want you to vocalize your support in this cause widget.
