  <description>Our Voices Together helps empower individuals  foster greater understanding, deal with underlying issues and negate the popularity of extremists.

Our Voices Together aims to reframe the public discussion concerning terrorism away from fear toward individual action by:

   1. empowering Americans to respond to terrorist tactics with meaningful, positive global actions;
   2. recruiting, networking and supporting individuals and organizations around the world involved in constructive civilian responses to terrorism; and
   3. providing leadership in the public discussion about U.S. national security to include strategies that involve individuals, address the resonance of extremists&#8217; message, and advance paths towards better lives and self-dignity.

1. Military and security measures are not sufficient on their own to prevent terrorism.

2. Individuals can create and change foreign policy.

3. As we move towards major elections in 2008, it is imperative that we generate a less fearful, more informed, public discussion about the predominant threat to the security of the United States and what we can do to more effectively minimize this threat.</description>
