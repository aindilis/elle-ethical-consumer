  <description>Peace is free.  

To smile
To laugh
To listen
To help
To give
To accept
To love                   
To encourage
To hope
To forgive
To befriend
To be kind
To be gentle

 =   PEACE

It has to start somewhere...somewhere small.  It has to start in you....and me....and in all of us.

This charity is one on good faith.  It requires no donation, just a promise, an concentrated effort, a deeply rooted desire to live your life, to greet all those around you, in peace.

"Peace begins with a smile." - Mother Theresa
