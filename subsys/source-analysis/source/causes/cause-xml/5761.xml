  <description>Miffest is a new showcaser's film festival which seeks funding from a variety of vendors, advertisors, and individual/family support from  both within and outside of the industry of film and television. 

Miffest is the first film festival that tries to converge the various genres of film into a study and discovery of new experimentation with within the "clash" or "fusion" of different genres. Our focus is to find new and innovative films which push the envelope by altering the way we view films today.

Our operation runs in the heart of Toronto, Canada where we begin our showcasing and festival run. All international titles are welcomed, as we like to acknowledge the craftsmanship of filmmaking worldwide. Miffest is open to all market vendors and distributors/sales agents as we frequently invite guests from within the industry to our events.

Attending our festival this year will be companies such as: Global Television, Alliance Atlantis, Universal Studios Canada, CityTV, Sony Canada, Astral Media, and others from across the industry.

Please stay tuned and support us as we prepare for this highly anticipated event!
