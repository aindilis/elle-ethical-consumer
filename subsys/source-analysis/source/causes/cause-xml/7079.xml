  <description>Super Greg and the Super Greg Concept are really all that matters in this world.  If the whole world would just get behind Super Greg then there would be no wars and no povety and no famine and no disco music and no warm beer and no ugly chicks.

It is our mission that we must get Super Greg elected to the highest office.

2. He's a better DJ than Arnold Swarchenegger</description>
