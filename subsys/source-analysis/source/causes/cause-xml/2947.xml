  <description>Many of us who were not born in Palestine have not had the chance to visit and experience life in our country first hand. 

The Israeli government has a program in place for Israelis that allows them to visit Israel as a "birth-right." 

If anyone is worthy of a birth-right to visit this holy land, then it is definitely the people the land was stripped from.

As opposed to the cities the Israelis get to visit, the cities Palestinians could relate to won't be as pretty, with exclusive resorts and the party life. Unless you are ready to experience how it is to live in a ghetto, and feel the pain our people are suffering, then do not join this cause.

1. Every Palestinian kid has the right to visit his country

2. Palestinian kids should not be alienated from their culture and land</description>
