  <description>Stem cell research is an opportunity to explore a whole new realm of possibilities, which may lead to a plethora of knowledge about cures for diseases that were previously incurable. However, embryonic stem cell research will encourage further destruction of human embryos that are human lives, and have the potential for life outside of the womb, and this must be stopped.

Stem cell research, and all of its benefits, can - and should - continue, but by using adult stem cells, which can be found in all tissues of the growing human being and, according to latest reports, also have the potential to transform themselves into practically all other cell types, or revert to being stem cells with greater reproductive capacity.

Embryonic stem cells have not yet been used for even one therapy, while adult stem cells have already been successfully used in numerous patients, including for cardiac infarction (death of some of the heart tissue).

1. Stem cell research in iteself is not immoral, however it is immoral to do research on a fetus that was aborted.

2. Embryonic stem cell research is encouraging abortions.

3. Abortion is murder.

4. Embryonic stem cells are taken from a developing embryo at the blastocyst stage, destroying the embryo, a developing human life; therefore it is murder.</description>
