  <description>If we are not careful there may no longer be freedom of speech. We must find a way to keep the fairness doctrine from passing. It was never about Don Imus. It was about the Liberal bias. All they care about is shutting up all who oppose them or who ever they want. This is wrong. Don Imus should never have been fired. No one is forcing you to listen or watch similar programs on TV. All you have to do is change the channel. There is no reason someone should be fired for stating their opinion. Just because you disagree with them that does not mean you have the right to shut them. Who gave Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson the moral right to say who should and should not be fired. They have done and said similar things in the past. All they got was a slap on the wrist, where as Don Imus got fired. This is absurd. John Stewart discusses similar topics on his show, yet no one says boo about that. I'm not saying that he should be fired. All I'm saying is why do some get the boot, while others get a free pass. We must say no to the Fairness Docdtrine.
