  <description>Once again, the whole world, especially the media, is jumping on a successful athlete because he's an easy target.  First of all, wait for all of the facts to come to the surface.  Second of all, some guys ran a dogfighting ring at his house, so he's all of the sudden a threat to society?  Also, dogfighting is a common occurrence, especially in Southern states, and the Vick circle is by no means on its own when it comes to this activity--that doesn't mean it's right, but it is certainly not exclusive to his circle of friends.

1. People should wait for the facts before pointing fingers.

2. Everyone needs to give Michael Vick a break.</description>
