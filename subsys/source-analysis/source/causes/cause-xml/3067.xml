  <description>Hey Ya'll! 
    A lot of you know that I at home in Denver raising financial support to go on full time staff at Inner City Impact in Chicago. ICI has served the inner city of Chicago for over 30 years in two of its toughest neighborhoods, Humboldt Park and Logan Square. Through core programs and mentoring opportunities, they have become a stable beacon of light in an often dark and cold world. I am SO excited to be a part of what God is doing in these communities and with these kids but I need your help!
        I would first like to ask that you be a part of this cause by praying for me and the ministry of ICI. God has already done some amazing things and I know His leading to Chicago will be aided by your thoughts and encouragement.  Second, the position that I will be taking is support/donation-based, meaning that all of my salary is based on financial donation. In order to move to Chicago and allow God to use me in the lives of these kids whom most of society has given up on, people have to support the cause. I would ask that you please consider being a part of helping these kids recapture their dreams by pledging a monthly donation or special gift to support my work in Chicago. I realize that this might not be a possibility for everyone but please know that any amount helps and that your investment, whether in prayer or money, is changing lives and restoring hope.
