  <description>My nephew just recently passed away at 34 days old due to Spinal Meningitis.  The doctors had no explanation except that it was just "bad luck".  Cole wasn't diagnosed until he was two days old, from there his brain progressively showed more and more damage.  Although he couldn't "see" or "hear", baby Cole Aaron was a fighter, and fought it out so he could at least go to his home, with his mommy and daddy to spend his last 2 nights.

1. Find a cure for this life-threatening neonatal disease.

2. Keep all sick babies in your prayers, everyday.</description>
