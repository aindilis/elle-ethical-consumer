  <description>Sam The Record Man on Yonge Street, with its storefront adorned with giant neon records, is not only a "record" store, but also a Toronto landmark. Inside, a huge selection of CDs and DVDs can be found.

Save the Heritage of this landmark business. Shop at and support the store. LETS SUPPORT THIS COMMUNITY!

Sam the record Man has been operating at its 347 Yonge Street, Toronto location for over 70 YEARS!, The signs were always a symbol of Toronto's culture and have been there for generations.

On June 30th 2007, the Famous Sam the Record Man store at 347 Younge Street will be closing its doors. The Sniderman family has had to put up with the internet downloading era long enough and can no longer make profits.

So, if the store closes, the least we can do to show Sam Sniderman some thanks for providing his wonderful cultural services to the city for 70 years would be to save the signs, as a landmark.
