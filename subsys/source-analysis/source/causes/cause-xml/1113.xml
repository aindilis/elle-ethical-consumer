  <description>If you believe that the future of our great nation is dependent on how we choose to educate our youth, then join with me in calling for true change in how we fund and support our public schools.  We need to call for equity in school funding and a refocus on academics.

1. Public education is a universal right

2. Quality education is a community responsibility

3. Strong education = strong nation</description>
