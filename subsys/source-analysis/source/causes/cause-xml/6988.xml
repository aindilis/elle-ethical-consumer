  <description>The Suicide Resource Center of Larimer County was founded in 1989, in response to the high number of suicide deaths in Larimer County. Since our beginning, we have worked to prevent suicide by raising awareness and educating the community, and have reached out to support families whose lives have been devastated by suicide.

Over the past 15 years, Larimer County's suicide rate has dropped from being one of the highest in Colorado to being below the state average. However, the battle to save the lives of those suffering from depression or bipolar disorder is far from over. Although we have made progress relative to other counties in Colorado, our rates remain higher than the national average.

The Suicide Resource Center is a nonprofit [501(c)(3)] organization with an active Board of Directors. Currently, the Center has two employees, an Executive Director and a Program Assistant. We are fortunate to have over 50 active, dedicated volunteers who help us provide services directly to the community.

1. Over 90% of the people who die from suicide suffer from a mental illness, most commonly a mood disorder such as depression or bipolar disorder.

2. Depression and Bipolar Disorder are both very treatable illnesses. 

3. If we can recognize and treat these illnesses, we can save lives!</description>
