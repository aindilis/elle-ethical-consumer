  <description>We need to stop the destruction of the last few wilderness areas in America. Urban exapantion is encroaching on the forests, mountains, islands, and waterways and more of these areas need to be expanded and more strictly protected.

2. They need to be more strictly protected

3. People need to be educated about the grandeur of nature</description>
