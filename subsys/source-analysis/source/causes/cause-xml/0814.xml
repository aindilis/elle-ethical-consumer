  <description>Chicago Cub's star first baseman Derrek Lee's daughter Jada was diagnosed in 2006 with Lebers Congenital Amaurosis, a rare genetic eye disease.  Lee subsequently founded the 1st Touch Foundation and Project 3000, with the goal to raise awareness and find a cure for subsequently.  Some of Lee's teammates have pledged to help the cause: Catcher Michael Barrett will donate $10,000 for every homerun he hits, and closing-pitcher Ryan will donate $1000 for every save, in addition to a $50,000 initial donation from each player.  This gives fans now a chance to join in the fight to find a cure.

All donations will be donated to Project 3000 via the University of Iowa Foundation.  Since there is not way to specify to which charity your money goes, you should donate my going to www.helpproject3000.org.  Donations made through this Cause will benefit the UI Foundation at large.
