  <description>To get some money together to help find the cause of SIDS(sudden infant death syndrome) 

Most SIDS researchers currently believe that SIDS is due to some type of brainstem dysfunction or immaturity, which affects breathing and sleep. Yet, these observations of rapid deaths which can not be revived, even in a very timely manner, are troubling, as they do not seem to fit the theory that SIDS is simply due to stopping breathing. Thus, these observations are important. They are teaching us something about SIDS, we are just not smart enough to know what it is --- yet. It just shows that we have a way to go before we understand the cause of SIDS.
