The CDSS strives to create a proud Canada where ALL are welcome, we embrace diversity and we value everyone's genes equally and to ensure equitable opportunities for all Canadians with Down syndrome.

This means, to make sure all Canadians with Down syndrome have the right supports to give them the same opportunities that everyone else has.
