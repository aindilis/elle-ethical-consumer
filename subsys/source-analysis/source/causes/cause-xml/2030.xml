  <description>Commonly seen as a quirk, Obssesive Compulsive Disorder is a medical problem. Those with the disorder face personal pain, problems obtaining treatment, financial distress, and inappropriate treatment by the public. To help those with OCD and related disorders, the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation was founded in 1986 to help raise awareness, help families and loved ones of individuals with the disorder or related disorders, and to help support research to aid in treatment. 

1. OCD and related disorders are very real and very painful to individuals with the disorder(s).

2. Education of the public will help individuals with the disorder(s) to live a more normal life.

3. The support of research into the disorder(s) will hopefully lead to better advances in treatments.</description>
