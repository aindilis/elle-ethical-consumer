U.S. law requires that nearly all food aid be grown in the U.S. and shipped at great expense across vast oceans. Much of the aid winds up subsidizing U.S. agricultural and shipping companies and undercutting poor farmers in the affected country, making it less likely they will be able to feed themselves in the future.

We can save more lives by changing the rules to allow some aid to be provided in cash either to purchase food locally or to allow poor people to buy food for themselves. We just need to convince Congress!


1. Access to food is a human right, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.claration of Human Rights.

2. Food aid should contribute to future self-sufficiency in food, not harm it.

3. Poor farmers in developing countries should not be hurt by food aid.</description>
