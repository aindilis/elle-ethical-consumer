  <description>Our dream is that no one else will become infected with HIV. For those who are HIV positive, we are dedicated on their behalf to educating all people about the virus and the overwhelming need for love and compassion in fighting this pandemic.

Our goal is to fund prevention education, care services, and vaccine development using The Bracelet as the tool.
