  <description>Inspired by Inga Muscio's book Cunt, we are all about women.  For too long women have remained silent, either by choice, by force, or because they knew no other way.  We want to end the silence.  (Most of) the world, its politics, economies, and religions, are dominated by men.  What sense does this make? The world has sprung forth from a woman's womb - how have we come to let our women be pushed to the side, to lose their value as women?  Women deserve to be acknowledged, not stepped on; to be revered, not locked away, mute, invisible.

We want possibilities, equal rights, safety, equal pay, education, child care, contraceptives, the rights to their own bodies, freedom, and much, much more for the women, womyn, and wimmin of this world.

Show you support women.  Buy their books, their movies, their music.  Honor their traditions, their needs, their rituals.  Go to their stores, listen to their stories, watch their backs.</description>
