  <description>my 3 year old daughter has jra and were back and forth to app all the time and meds are going up and down all the time ,she suffers alot with pain and sometimes cant even hold her fork to eat her meals, cant go to the washroom by herself or even walk, what 3 year old or any  child should not be able to walk this is not fair, and to see your child suffer is the most heart breaking thing.

1. children should be able to play and not suffer when they do

2. our kids health is important

3. children shouldnt have to wake up with pain</description>
