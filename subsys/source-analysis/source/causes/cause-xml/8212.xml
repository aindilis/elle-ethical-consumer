  <description>This organization is called The Brotherhood Society and is exclusive to its members in certain practices and customs. Its purpose is to implement Christian ethics and a strong sense of moral clarity in our Bahamian society. 

Furthermore, it was established to promote a sense of brotherhood in a man&#8217;s personal and public life which is diminishing due to the increased influence of negative culture and behaviour in our country and internationally. 

We seek to foster a brotherly network among its members within their natural spheres of influence to the purpose of rising up young men who will be educated in proper etiquette and morality and gentlemanly decorum. 

The Society wishes to raise this money to assist with the following:

-The Lend a Hand Program
- Scholarship Fund
- Vision 2008
- Community &amp; Outreach Committee
