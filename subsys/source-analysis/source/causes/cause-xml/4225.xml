  <description>James Christolear and Janet Vaher are getting married! Problem is, due to lack of money (James is a poor white folk and Janet's past implies she's a crazy money spending asian), there has been no official date set yet. Yes, very sad news. But with everyone's help, we can hopefully save up enough to get married next summer! Then comes our next mission: Honeymoon! I suppose the country fields of Nebraska are a way better vacation than Hawaii, right?!

1. We want to be able to invite everyone therefore, need lots of money to buy delicious food and beer!

2. You all want free liquor right?!

3. It'll be an awesome and crazy fun time! Share your love for our love!(haha cheesy!)</description>
