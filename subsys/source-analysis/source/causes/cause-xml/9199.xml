  <description>The essence of conservatism is the belief that you are intelligent, ambitious, entrepreneurial, positive, responsible, and self-sustaining.

Conservatism promotes:
-Limited government
-A large military to defend ourselves from attack and to secure our position as the most powerful country in the world
-A free and open market fueled by capitalism and the spirit of entrepreneurialism
-Low and flat taxes
-Private health care
-Private education

Conservatism states that it is not the government's responsibility to provide you with health care, education, jobs, or success. It is your responsibility to gain these for yourself.
