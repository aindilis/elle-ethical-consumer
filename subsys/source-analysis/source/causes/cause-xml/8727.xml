  <description>ABOUT PROJECT PET:  
Project Pet is a 501(c)(3) community-based, people/pet project founded by volunteers from four local animal welfare organizations who have joined together to humanely reduce pet overpopulation in the Midlands through innovative, pro-active programs.

By supporting Project Pet, you can provide medical care for our community's abandoned pets. And by contributing to Project Pet's building fund for a community no-kill pet shelter/adoption center, you will give these homeless animals hope for a better tomorrow.

1. Animal suffering needs to be alleviated.

2. Pets should be spayed and neutered.

3. We should create a community that will assist, develop, promote and strengthen the quality of life for our companion animals.</description>
