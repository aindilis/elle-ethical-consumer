  <description>Tabs 4 cancer is an organization dedicated to finding a cure for cancer. We have started this because there are to many people in the world suffering from cancer, and even more of us letting it happen. Cancer's not going to cure itself. It is now in our hands to do something about it. We came up with the idea of collecting pop can tabs because when we take them to the junk yard we recieve money and all the money that is rasied, we donate to clinics, hospitals, and families in need of financial support. We're not asking for money we're just asking for a tab! Donations are welcome as well. We have an amazing group of friends that support this cause and help us every step of the way. The t4c team believes there is a cure out there and we have to work together to find it. It's not just about raising money it's about spreading awarness and letting others know that cancer is out there and affecting millions of people in different ways. We have found inspiration in Rob Dyer and The skate 4 cancer team, they are an amazing group of people also dedicated to finding a cure. It takes teamwork so join the team :) 
we will be hosting different kinds of events, so it would mean the world to us if you could come out and support the fight against cancer!
