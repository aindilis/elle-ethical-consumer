  <description>(Pronouced Honey) To provide new, and gently used clothes at no cost what-so-ever to all families who ask for them, no matter how great the need. We [my best friend and business partner Ashton Morgan] are striving to collect clothes of all different sizes and styles from students at UMR (or anywhere). We will wash them, sort them, and provide a place for families to come and pick out clothes mainly for teenagers or young adults. If you would like to volunteer to work for us on Sundays please let me know. Also if you are willing to donate any of your clothes or siblings clothes please drop them by our house. We appreciate everything and look forward to helping those in need.

1. Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Colossians 3:12

2. Get rid of your old clothes, make a kid's day!</description>
