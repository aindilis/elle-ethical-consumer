  <description>To quote Morrissey : "I'd Rather Eat My Testicles Than Re-form The Smiths."

Yes, yes. We all understand it will be a quite difficult and arduous task for the reunification of a  musical landmark. 

But what wouldn't I do just to have the dashing jinglings of Johnny Marr paired with the lethally witty and angelic voice of Morrissey.

Since the frictions and conflicts brewed over the years made the cause seemingly more unapproachable, we will allow slight deviations from the original design of the band.

Perhaps Mike Joyce is an unnecessary asset after all, perhaps YOU can replace him as the drummer of The Smiths.

Andy Rourke can come too...

1. Step One:Have Morrissey and Marr play a gig together.

2. Step Two: Reunification of The Smiths

3. Step Three: Release a new album.</description>
