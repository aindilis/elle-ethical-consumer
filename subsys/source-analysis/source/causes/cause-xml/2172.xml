  <description>OLCV Education Fund helps citizens translate their passion for the environment into effective action.  Through the Oregon Conservation Network, we rally support in the Legislature to enact the environmental community's priorities (www.oregonpriorities.org).  We run a series of training programs aimed to help citizens become more effective leaders, and we educate Oregonians about environmental issues.

1. Protecting Oregon's environment depends on the people of Oregon taking responsibility for our future.</description>
