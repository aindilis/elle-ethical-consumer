Your donations will help The University of Central Florida offer more services to its students. Your donation will go toward an endowment, so that if 50,000 dollars are raised, a permanent flow of 2,500 dollars will be earned every year.

You can choose which area you would like to donate:

Student Financial Need: For students whose parents have little to no money to provide for their education

Student Scholarships: To lure high school seniors with outstanding academics to UCF in order to raise the UCF average GPA and SAT scores.

Academic Capital Improvement: To help UCF build more and better classrooms, dorms, and anything else that is not for athletic purposes.
