  <description>Our friend is running the October 7th marathon in Chicago.  His goal is to raise $4,000 for leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma research.  We would like to help him by creating a Facebook Cause on his behalf.  Please donate any amount for the fight against these life shattering diseases.
