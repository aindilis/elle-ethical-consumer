  <description>As all of us know, that there is global warming, pollution, our lakes are starting to dry up, we even know have an extremely invasive plant growing in our lakes! But worst of all, there is a war going on.  This war should have ended about 5 or 6 years ago, and who knows how long it is still going to be going?! Everyone has been taught to use there words, and NOT there actions, but I think everyone has forgotten about that, because there are many wars going on, and if we don't start trying to make world peace, it could be the beginning of the end!

1. The wars need to end!

2. Try to make world peace!</description>
