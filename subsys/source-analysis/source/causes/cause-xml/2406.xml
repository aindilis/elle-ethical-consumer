  <description>Israel is the Jewish national homeland. It is home to over 6 million people, with a fifteen percent Arab population that LIVES FREE. This group is for everyone who supports Israel, the Jewish homeland, and agrees with the fact that everyone has the right to defend themselves in the face of terrorism and hatred. 

"Israel cannot afford to lose even a single war without exposing its population to genocide and its nationhood to politicide. Wars waged against Israel are wars of extermination that target its cities and
population centers. Its enemies are seeking its total destruction."

1. Israel is the free and independent Jewish homeland. 

2. Israel has the right to defend themselves under any circumstances.</description>
