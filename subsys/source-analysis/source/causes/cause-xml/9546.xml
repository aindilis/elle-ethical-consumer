  <description>Newly-commercialized technologies tend to be dominated by companies pushing solutions that are not interoperable, causing vendor lock-ins for the users. Witness the pre-Internet commercial networks (CompuServe, AOL), document standards (WordPerfect, Word, Lotus 1-2-3, Excel), proprietary HTML tags and non-standards-compliance (Netscape Navigator pre-Mozilla, Internet Explorer), video codecs (WMV).

We believe that, insofar as public institutions, consumers, and everyone else not involved in selling a proprietary solution are concerned, open standards are beneficial, in that it facilitates competition on merit, better interoperability and better archiving.

1. Proprietary formats lock customers and hinder competition

2. Documents need to be interoperable and archivable

3. In a market economy, large public institutions are obligated to use their buying power responsibly and support open alternatives</description>
