  <description>"The Human Fund" is a fictional charitable organization mentioned in the "The Strike" episode of Seinfeld, a popular United States based television sitcom of the 1990s.

Due to his unconscionable cheapness, George Constanza (played by Jason Alexander) found yet another way to save money. Instead of exchanging Christmas gifts (per normal custom) with his co-workers, when George was given a gift he in turn gave his co-worker a card stating that a donation had been made in their name to a charity called "The Human Fund" (with the slogan "Money For People"), when in fact this organization didn't exist. George had fabricated The Human Fund to get out of having to spend money on gifts. George's boss, Mr. Kruger (played by Daniel von Bargen), is told by his accounting department that his company needed to donate some money (for tax purposes). Kruger subsequently gives George a company check for $20,000 and tells him to give it to The Human Fund. The accounting department, after doing some research, later learns that The Human Fund indeed does not exist. When Kruger calls George on this, George becomes flustered and begins to babble on about how he made it up because he didn't celebrate Christmas and was embarrassed to tell anyone. He insists that his family instead celebrates 'Festivus'. Unconvinced, Kruger accepts George's invitation to the Festivus celebration at George's house to see if his story adds up.
