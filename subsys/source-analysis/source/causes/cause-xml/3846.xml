  <description>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common, life-threatening genetic diseases, effecting 600,000 Americans and 12.5 million people, worldwide. ADPKD affects more people than Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia combined.

ADPKD causes fluid-filled cysts to grow on the kidneys. Over time, these cysts multiply and grow, in 50 percent of cases, causing kidney failure. Dialysis and transplantation are the only treatments for kidney failure. There is no treatment or cure for PKD.

ADPKD affects 1 in 500 newborns, children and adults regardless of sex, age, race or ethnic origin. It does not skip a generation. Parents with ADPKD have a 50 percent chance of passing the disease on to each of their children.

Money and time is needed to find a cause for this disease. There are walks around the US. And many different ways to donate money so a cure can be found. We are closer and closer every day.

1. A cure is right around the corner, funding is needed to keep the programs going.</description>
