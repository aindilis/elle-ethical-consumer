  <description>Appalachia Service Project (ASP) is a nation-wide cause that attempts to help needy families through simple construction projects. The program focuses its efforts on the Appalachia region of the US and primarily serves the most impoverished areas. Many churches, schools, and businesses have taken the opportunity to travel down to the region and help. ASP has a strong religious background. Volunteers spread spirit and hope through the region in an attempt to bring some sort of peace to those who are less fortunate.

1. Through faith and service it is possible to make a difference in anyone's life.</description>
