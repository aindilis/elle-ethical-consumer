  <description>Grayson needs a new drumset. The one he has right now is really old...the bass doesn't even have a back head...and the cymbal stands give out way to easily...and the cymbals suck...but the high-hat's pretty good.

ya...so donations are excepted
...pitty is required, only because it leads to donations

you can give your donations to me at my house, or at a show...if we get a gig, we'll let everyone know

1. Broken Traditions will sound even more amzing with a new drumset

2. Drumsets shouldn't be really old, unless they have been referbished...

3. Grayson deserves a new drumset</description>
