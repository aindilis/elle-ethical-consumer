  <description>Smoking-related diseases claim an estimated 419,000 American lives each year, and the number of people, especially children, with asthma is growing. The American Lung Association funded 128 national grants and awards in 2001-2002, including research on asthma, lung cancer, sleep-disordered breathing, cystic fibrosis and influenza vaccines. One of the American Lung Association's recent accomplishments was adopting Open Airways for Schools, the ALA's premier asthma education program for children. The program has been shown to reduce the number of children's asthma episodes, improve their grades, and help them feel confident about managing their asthma.
