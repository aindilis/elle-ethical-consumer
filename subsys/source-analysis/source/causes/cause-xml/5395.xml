  <description>Laos is the poorest country in South East Asia, 46% of the population are illiterate and there is a desperate need for schools with proper resources.
Our school will be built through the charity Room to Read, everything we raise goes directly to them, you can find out more about this great charity at www.roomtoread.org 
The community are heavily involved in the building of the school and have to donate time and resources to ensure they are committed to bringing education to their town. This system means that Room to Read schools are valued and utilised by the communities that work to build them and that the students and population has a sense of ownership over the school.
The majority of funds that make the building of the school possible are raised by funds like Laotian Commotion, check out what we do here- www.laotiancommotion.org . Please make a donation and tell your friends!

1. Education is a right and not a priviledge.

2. If the cycle of poverty is to be broken then an educated population is key.</description>
