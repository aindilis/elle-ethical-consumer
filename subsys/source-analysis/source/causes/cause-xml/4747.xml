    McMaster Children's Hospital is one of the largest pediatric healthcare facilities in Canada and the second busiest in Ontario. Children and families come from Hamilton, Halton, Niagara, Brant, Guelph and beyond to receive specialized care at our hospital.

    Over 40 pediatric clinics within McMaster Children's Hospital help young patients with asthma, cancer, developmental disorders and virtually any illness. In the past year, more than 150 000 children and their families were cared for. McMaster Children's Hospital is also home to one of the country's newest and busiest Neonatal Intensive Care Units. Some of the outpatient programs and services offered at McMaster Children's Hospital can be found at the Chedoke site, including the Nutrition, Metabolism and Exercise Program, the Developmental Pediatrics and Rehabilitation Program and the Offord Centre.

    McMaster Children's Hospital is caring for our future, one child at a time.
