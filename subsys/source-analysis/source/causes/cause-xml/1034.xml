  <description>Welcome to the official Genocide Intervention Network Cause! We encourage our members to start their own Causes as well -- check out some of our &lt;a href="http://apps.facebook.com/causes/beneficiaries/show/52"&gt;featured Causes on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;!

===============================

Our members envision a world in which the global community is willing and able to protect civilians from genocide and mass atrocities. As part of the anti-genocide movement, we raise both money and political will for civilian protection initiatives around the world. 

Our landmark anti-genocide tools include the &lt;a href="http://www.1800genocide.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-800-GENOCIDE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hotline and the &lt;a href="http://www.darfurscores.org"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darfur congressional scorecard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
