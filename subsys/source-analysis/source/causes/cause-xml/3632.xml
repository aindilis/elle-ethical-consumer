  <description>Kids for World Health (KFWH) is a grassroots organization that was founded in 2001 at Chatsworth Avenue School, in Larchmont, New York by a then 3rd grade class who were motivated after watching a CBS film from "60 Minutes" on the Southern Sudan Sleeping Sickness Program in 1994. KFWH was founded as compassionate reaction to the thousands of people who die each year from Sleeping Sickness, knowing that a cure exists in the western world, but for them has been unattainable. There are KFWH chapters all around the world. Kids for World Health is a 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit corporation with a humanitarian objective.

1. "Life is important for all people of the world, rich or poor."

2. Sleeping sickness is curable, and should be cured!

3. Drug companies should provide the vital drugs to the African children instead of creating vanity products for the wealthier populous.</description>
