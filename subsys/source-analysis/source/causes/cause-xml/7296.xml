  <description>I decided to start this cause with Lindsay ______ (who wants to remain nameless and a loner and a complete tard) when I saw a cause to do with hip hop and someone saying it rocked. Cause it really doesn't. It sucks. A LOT. So I would like to join forces with everyone that still likes to rock out to various bands, such as: Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, The White Stripes, Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, and/or any other kick ass musical formations.


That is all.

1. MTV sucks.

2. Hip-hop sucks.

3. Rap sucks.

4. Simple Plan and Nickelback sucks.

5. The Beat 94.5 sucks.</description>
