  <description>This cause is simply put here to get people to eat better. Not healthier, this isn't nutrition class, but better.  This cause is designed to get you to go across the street and get fresh loaf of bread and some olive oil from the store instead of McDonalds. Thats not literally the cause but you get the point. I would recommend that everyone start eating good food rather than fast food. You'll most likely feel better, and live better. Thats all this cause aims to do.
