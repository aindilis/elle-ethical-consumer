  <description>Poaching is illegal hunting or fishing. The following are just some examples of reasons it may be illegal: 1) The game or fish is out of season. 2) The animal is on restricted land. 3) The right to hunt his animal is claimed by somebody. 4) The means used are illegal (for example, baiting a field while hunting quail). 5) The animal or fish is protected by law (see for example the Endangered Species Act for the USA).

If you do witness or learn of someone committing the crime of poaching, you can report it to your local wildlife enforcement officer, the local poaching hotline or to the state, provincial, or federal conservation authorities.  See http://www.naweoa.org for more information.

1. Every living being has a right to life.

2. Killing an animal for anything other than a necessity of life is murder.</description>
