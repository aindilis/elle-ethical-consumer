  <description>Prevention and recovery treatment are better forms of handling the problems associated with drug addiction. Non-violent drug offenders should not be thrown in jail or unjustly punished financially. Many offenders need a long and persistent treatment program coupled with outside support and moderate life success to be able to crawl out of the whole they have dug for themselves. Whether or not addiction is classified as a disease, addicts need tremendous help and a change in what we expect from a recovered addict. 

1. Drug use is ruining the quality of many people's lives.

2. The current methods of criminalization are not universally effective.

3. More reacclaimation programs are needed to make these willing people productive members of society.

4. Society needs to accept that addicts can recover and succeed.</description>
