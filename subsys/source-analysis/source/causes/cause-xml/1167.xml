  <description>Our services are structured around the understanding that great leaps in learning can happen with one-on-one attention and that strong writing skills are fundamental to future success. With this in mind we will provide drop-in tutoring, field trips, after-school workshops, in-schools tutoring, help for English language learners, and assistance with student publications. All of our free programs will seek to strengthen each student&#8217;s power to express ideas effectively, creatively, confidently, and in his or her individual voice.

Scheduled to open its doors officially in the fall, 826 Boston is to become the seventh chapter of 826 National, an umbrella organization that works toward duplicating the successful 826 Valencia program in youth writing centers across the country. Recognized as an official chapter in December, 826 Boston has access to all the pedagogical tools that made 826 successful in other cities. We are also an autonomous, local organization, responsible for all our administrative and educational operations.
