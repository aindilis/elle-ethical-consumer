  <description>As a cause we seek to aid humanity in surviving the onslaught of Zombies when the day comes that the dead come back to life.  We seek to let the world know the general facts about zombies, tactics to survive, ways to fight, weapons to use, and whom to sacrifice in order to survive.

1. Those who hold you back (unless you really love them) get left behind.

2. If you scream and freeze up, you die!

3. React, or die.

4. Shoot first, ask questions later.

5. Guns are your friends.</description>
