  <description>There are many ignorant and intolerant people in the world today.  I have started this cause for all those who  have been persecuted for simply being themselves.  We need to educate today's youth to be more responsible with their rights and freedoms and learn to get along better with others.  We need to get to the root of the problem: the messages in the media.  I am a dedicated individual with a heart for the youth and for the media.  I seek to go to Vancouver Film School to receive the best education in Canada so I may have successful opportunities in this industry.  I want to influence others to be more open and accepting and to inspire the youth of today.  They need to know that our world is falling apart, but they hold the keys to bettering it if they choose to and if they are educated on how to.  They need to understand the responsible way to defy society and accept their differences with pride.  I pray my children never have to endure the suffering and persecution I had to as a child because I was "different".  Will you join with me in support of saving the freaks???

1. We must take pride in being who we are.

2. Intolerance should not be tolerated.

3. Education and community are key.</description>
