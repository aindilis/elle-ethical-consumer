  <description>Children need families.

Most of the children in &#8220;orphanages&#8221; in Ghana are not really orphans but their parents and extended families find it difficult to care for them because of the burden of poverty, disease, and lack of social protection.  They end up sending them to &#8220;orphanages&#8221; simply to ensure access to food and education.

We help families of children at risk of abandonment and give them secure futures within their communities. Families are forever, and even in the era of HIV/AIDS, they provide a vital safety net.

We work to strengthen families and communities so they can care for their own children.  We believe that poverty and ill health are not reasons for separating children from their families, and that children living in institutions should be resettled as soon as possible through family tracing and reunification or fostering.
