  <description>BUILD A MIRACLE is a non-profit organization based in San Diego, CA, that raises funds to build homes 
for needy families in Tijuana, located just across the Mexican border.

DE COLORES is a student-run program at Loyola Marymount University which sends groups of about 30 students down every month to Tijuana, Mexico, to work with families in impoverished areas to build their future homes.

Most of the work done by LMU's DE COLORES program is supported by BUILD A MIRACLE, a non-profit organization founded by LMU alums Chris and Julianne North, so help support DE COLORES by helping BUILD A MIRACLE!!!
