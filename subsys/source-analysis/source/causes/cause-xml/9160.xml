  <description>&lt;b&gt;42% of Americans identify themselves as independent voters.&lt;/b&gt;  Independents are unified by the understanding that the political process has been corrupted by special interests and partisanship.

&lt;b&gt;That's we&#8217;re organizing independents &#8211; not into a third party - but a movement to change politics in America.&lt;/b&gt; To reform the political process and create a voice for ordinary Americans. 

We're organizing independent voters at the grassroots to keep changing politics in America. 

In California, there's an exciting new initiative that would restructure the political process to give ordinary people real power - and not just the parties and special interests!!

Help us reach as many Californians as possible about the new open primary measure on the June 2010 ballot!
