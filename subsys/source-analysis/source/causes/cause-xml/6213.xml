  <description> don't ever think for one moment, you can't make it!! nothing is worth killing someone who can't fight for their lives!! these innocent children never did anything wrong...they were just unwanted. correct me if im wrong, but isnt murder a crime?? an abortion is murder........it is a crime that slips right under the radar. please send this to all of ut friends so that we can stop these horrible crimes from bing commited. there is such a thing as adoption....if you or your friends are adopted like i am....you'll understand that you could have ended up like these innocent lives..but u didnt..u were given a chance, u werent murdered.

There are over 126,000 teen abortions per day. 
More than half abortions are from wealthy women 
who can obtain birth control easily. Whoever told 
you that an aborted baby was never a life, lied to you..  This is a large problem in the United States, and we need it to stop! Many teens and young adults get abortions. Over 1,000,000 abortions are done in the US alone, each year. To reduce this risk, put into consideration of babies and give them a chance. They want to live! Not be murdered! Every child was put here for a reason, don't stop their chances of being something big!!!

1. Abortion not only inhumane it is a crime</description>
