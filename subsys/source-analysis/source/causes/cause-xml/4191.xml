  <description>As we all know NYC pretty much dominates the population of NYS.  Well, there's no reason that students in the northcountry should be given a sub-par education just because we have a smaller population.  Let's bring some money up to the northcountry and get our education systems at least on level with the rest of the state.  The only thing I could have money donated to even CLOSE was in Malone.  So it'll be staying somewhat local.

1. It's not about the money, it's about the equal rights to a good education.</description>
