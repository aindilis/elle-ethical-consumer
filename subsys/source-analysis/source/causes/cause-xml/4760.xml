  <description>"Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue, Don't Harass" is the only law in the land that authorizes the firing of an American for being gay. There is no other federal, state or local law like it. Indeed, "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue, Don't Harass" is the only law that makes it illegal to come out. Many Americans view the policy as a benign gentlemen's agreement with discretion as the key to job security. That is simply not the case. An honest statement of one's sexual orientation to anyone, anywhere, anytime may lead to being fired.
