  <description>From the Camp Sunshine Website
(http://campsunshine.org):

"Camp Sunshine supports children with life threatening illnesses and their families.  The camp has the distinction of being the only program in the nation whose mission is to address the impact of a life threatening illness on every member of the immediate  family&#8212;the ill child, the parents, and the siblings.  Since its inception, Camp Sunshine has provided a haven for over 16,000 individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds.

Families with a child diagnosed with diseases such as cancer, kidney disease, lupus, solid organ transplants, and other life threatening illnesses attend one of the week-long camps.  Our focus is on alleviating the strain that a life threatening illness takes not only on the sick child but also on other family members.  Families have an opportunity to rebuild their relationships together and meet other families facing similar challenges.

. . .Each family is sponsored by an individual, civic group, corporation, or foundation, which enables a family to spend a week at Camp Sunshine free of charge.  The sponsorship   for one family to participate in the week-long program is $1,500.  The Family Sponsorship Program provides a way for donors to sponsor a family or families from their geographic area."
