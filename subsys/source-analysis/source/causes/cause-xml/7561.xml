  <description>Little Donny is, quite simply, an inspiration to us all. The fact that a child could live with such an affliction as Little Donny Disease (magnimus- obliviophallocytis) and still carry himself with such courage and aplomb serves to embiggen all of us and allows us to, yes, hope against hope for a cure for this terrible disease. Donny is at heart a plucky kid who somehow manages to struggle day to day with a disease that none of us can even imagine living with, and we can all learn a lot from him.

There are many things you can do to help us in our fight against Little Donny Disease. Sign the electronic petition
