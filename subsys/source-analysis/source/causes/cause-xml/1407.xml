  <description>A group of young people will be departing from Milwaukee, Wisconsin sometime in early '08 (exact dates are still to be decided) to begin a cross-country roadtrip that aims to bring about social justice for LGBTQA people.  Through means of open communication and honest dialogue, the Queer Roadtrip plans to offer hope to suffering and closeted LGBTQA people, as well as shed light on the lies, myths and misunderstandings that are so frequently spread about our community.

Our goal is to visit college campuses, both private and state, as well as high school GSAs to give presentations about the many issues that are faced by the LGBTQA community.  In addition, we intend to spend as much time as possible in one-on-one situations with students to answer questions and provide educational materials and resources.

Queer Roadtrip is actively seeking young adults who are passionate about social justice for LGBTQA people and willing to devote time and money to this trip.  We are also looking for sponsorships, donations, and other financial supporters who can help make this trip happen.

1. A person's sexual orientation should not exclude him/her from health care, marriage rights, educational privilages, or anything for that matter.

2. The lies, myths, and misunderstandings that are currently being spread about LGBTQA people must end.

3. More beneficial than protests, picketing, and civil disobedience, Queer Roadtrip believes in the power of open communication and honest dialogue to bring about change.</description>
