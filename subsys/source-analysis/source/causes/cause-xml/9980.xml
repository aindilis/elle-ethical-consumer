  <description>It's pretty obvious that most teens you know use the Internet regularly. In fact, it's surprising when you find someone who doesn't. Most of the time it's for communication through such mediums as AIM or Skype, or through social networking sites like MySpace.

But what messages are these teens getting? What messages do we get every single day from the sites we visit?

New Hope exists to reach out to teens with the love and grace of Jesus Christ, to help them use the Internet discerningly and safely, and to connect them with other believers.

Whether or not you're a Christian doesn't matter, join this group if you are willing to support this cause. It's time we take back our generation!

1. God is eternally present in 3 persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

2. The Bible is the only true, authoritative Word of God.

3. The Internet is our mission field.

4. Jesus is RAD.</description>
