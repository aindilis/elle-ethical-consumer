  <description>This cause is to mostly to prevent horse, cat, and dog slaughter. Anyone who has the chance to join..sould defineately do it! 

1. Animals are like people, and should be treated like them

2. People aren't allowed to slaughter other people, so why are they allowed to do it to animals?

3. This is an unfair thing to do!</description>
