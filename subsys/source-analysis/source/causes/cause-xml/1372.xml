  <description>Our goal is simply to spread the Word of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  "Spreading Christianity" may be a misleading title, because we are NOT trying to spread the religion.  We are spreading the Word, His Word.  We are spreading the relationship with God. 

We hope to spread Gods word to all members of the planet; introducing Gods children to their Father.  We can spread the Word of the Lord in many ways.  It is important to tell people in your home, in your neighborhood, and in your county about the amazing things God does for us.  You can help spread the Word by taking neighbors to church, starting youth groups in your community, teaching non-believers the Scriptures, and in many, MANY other ways.  

Donations go to Christian Resources International, a non-profit organization that helps educate people by distributing free Christian material into the vast areas that need it most.  There is a link for the website at the top of this cause page.
