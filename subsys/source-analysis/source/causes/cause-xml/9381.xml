  <description>Help us fight gum pollution i cities all around the world. 

Gum pollution is very costly and almost impossible to clean up. Local goverments spends milions on keeping the cities clean, which is money that could be spend on health care, education or other important areas.

Gum is also very polluting for the nature. A peace of gum takes under a second to spit out, but 5 years for the nature to brake down. 

Wrap your gum or spit it in a bin when your done.

1. Gum pollution must go down!
