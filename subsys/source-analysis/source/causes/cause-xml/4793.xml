  <description>GalaxyGoo is science, art, and discovery. Our primary mission is to increase science literacy. The resources we develop are free to teachers, students, and the general public. 

We bring together scientists, teachers, programmers, web developers, artists, and writers to collaborate on the development of educational software and curriculum materials. 

The GalaxyGoo web site is a resource, a collaboration space, a community center, and a gallery of experiments in multimedia and online technologies.

1. Everyone should have at least a basic understanding of science.

2. There should be more project-based learning experiences for students of all ages.
