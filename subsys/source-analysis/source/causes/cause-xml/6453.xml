  <description>Harvard Prof Tal Ben Shahar, Daniel Gilbert, PhD and many other influential scientists for ten years have focused not just on curing mental illness, but in how one can grow personal capacity for mental fortitude, compassion, self-confidence and happiness.   This then is a way to share in what science tells us about how we find happiness and what works or not.

1. Learn to fail or fail to learn.

2. Permission to be human.

3. Excellence, not perfection... goal setting can be helpful or very, very harmful.

4. Savor less things more thoroughly.

5. The bad comes, but it goes, too.

6. Broaden and build- find something that effectively takes your mind away to somewhere better.

7. Exercise, eat well, sleep enough, meditate.

8. Write about the good things each day, sharing those things among your friends. Read their good things and be doubly happy.</description>
