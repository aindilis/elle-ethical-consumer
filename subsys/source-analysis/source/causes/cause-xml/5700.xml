  <description>More than half of Africa's people lack access to safe drinking water. To us at WWTS, this is completely unacceptable. We believe that having access to clean drinking water is a basic human right. We are working to develop this website in an attempt to raise awareness about the issues of clean water access in Africa. 100% of your donations will go to help Well Worth The Sacrifice bring clean, sanitized water to those in need in Africa. YES! I want to support a child, a family, a town, and stand by my fellow men, women and children who are struggling to survive on a daily basis. Please join us on our crusade to make a difference to the thousands of human souls who desperately need it.

1. Water is scarce, and they only need around two of our toilet flushes.
