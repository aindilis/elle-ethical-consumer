  <description>Neckbeard has graduated, but hasn't had luck getting a job this summer. Let's get beardy a job.

1. Beard is an excellant example of a promising UD alumnus.

2. Businesses and organizations need to strongly consider the wasted opportunity of not hiring Neckbeard

3. Ergo, it is our duty to go to every business and organization Beard wishes to apply to, and convince them of the merits of Beard. 

4. Should the proprietors of said bussinesses or organizations fail to recognize the triumph that is Beard, they will be tied and be given consecutive "wet willies" until they become enlightened.

5. Should the wet willies also fail, then it is probably best to withdraw our arguments and simply move on. They simply don't know what they're missing.</description>
