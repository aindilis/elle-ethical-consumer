  <description>Ok so we all know that there is this thing called Global Warming out there but what happends after Global Warming? Global Cooling. So why not skip Global Warming and get right to Global Cooling. Endless Snowboarding and Skiing seasons, plus! More possible area's to ride and ski would be found with the spread of snow to areas that usually don't get any or enough of the white fluffy stuff. Which will then open up new buisnesses and an Economical Boom!
