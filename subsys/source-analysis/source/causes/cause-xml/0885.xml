  <description>Religion causes much more violence than good and I feel it is no longer worth practicing since people only seem to be dying in the name of god(s).

1. No religion is better than fighting over a god.

2. Very few wars are fought that have nothing to do with religion.

3. Religion blinds people

4. Religion causes people to be weak</description>
