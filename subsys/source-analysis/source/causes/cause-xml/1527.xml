Established in June 2001, the Anything's Possible Players theatre company has provided education, arts and entertainment to the Greenwich community for the past six summers. The progrm was developed to provide inclusive opportunities for teens and young adults with and without disabilities between the ages of 14 and 25. It is our hope that through theatre we encourage young people to develop friendships, express creativity, and learn the appreciate the gifts and talents of all cast members. Using theatre is an excellent, exciting, and fun way to teach valuable skills and enhance abilities. The troupe continues to grow each year from 18 performers in the year 2001 to 53 in 2006.
