  <description>The White Rhinoceros is one of the most endangered animals on the planet.  They are only found in the Congo region.  With such political unrest, the government is unable to take measures to preserve these animals.  The few that are still around in the wild, and the 2 found at the San Diego Wild Animal Park and 6 in the Chek Republic are the last of their kind.  The US and Cheks are trying desperately to promote reproduction, but more attention must be brought to the cause!

Save the rhinos! 

1. Sudan must help preserve these animals.

2. More awareness can bring the eyes to both the animal and human genocide.</description>
