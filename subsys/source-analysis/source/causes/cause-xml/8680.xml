  <description>AA has a 5% success rate or less.
AA is a dangerous cult that keeps you there for life.You are told that if you leave or refuse to do the steps you will die.Brainwashing tactics.
Most people in AA have no life outside of the group.
Many churches support this cult believing the steps are biblical and AA is christian.Its not.AA denys Christ.
Bill Wilson recieved the steps while in a trance.He was an occultist.
Bill Wilson couldnt even follow his own program.He smoked and cheated on his wife.
There is no DISEASE.The disease/Allergy theory was invented by Bills Proctologist.As of yet there is no hard scientific evidence to prove that its anything more than a behavioral problem.
The "Big book" itslef states that AAers must put recovery above everything,even their families.AA promotes selfcenteredness to the extreme.Except when recruiting for them.
People sentenced to AA are often sentenced by Judges and doctors who themselves are involved in the cult.
