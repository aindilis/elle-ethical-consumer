  <description>Maybe I'm spending too much of my time starting up clubs and putting on plays. I should probably be trying harder to score chicks. That's all anyone really cares about. I saved Latin. What did you ever do? 


1. Apiculture

2. Saving Latin

3. Building Aquariums. With Piranhas. Lots of Piranhas. I'm talking to a guy in South America. </description>
