  <description>The Three Principles of the People (Traditional Chinese: &#19977;&#27665;&#20027;&#32681;; Hanyu Pinyin: S&#257;n M&#237;n Zh&#468;y&#236;; Wade-Giles: San-min Chu-i), also translated as Three People's Principles, or collectively San-min Doctrine, is a political philosophy developed by Sun Yat-sen as part of a program to make China a free, prosperous, and powerful nation. Its legacy of implementation is most apparent in the governmental organization of the Republic of China, which currently administers Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu Islands. Dr. Sun's philosophy has been the corner stone of the Republic of China that we know today. The principles also appear in the first line of the National Anthem of the Republic of China.
