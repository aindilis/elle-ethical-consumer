  <description>This cause is an attempt to restore Ancient Greek Polytheism as a major world religion and assert Zeus back to his rightful throne on Mt. Olympus that Jesus wrongfully kicked him off of. We must build temples, spread the word, and praise the true lord and King of the Gods, Zeus Almighty. Animal sacrifices optional. 

1. Zeus is the one true Lord.

2. Ancient Greek Polytheism must be spread to the general public.</description>
