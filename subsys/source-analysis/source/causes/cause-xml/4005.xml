  <description>Last year there were 8,259 gun deaths in the United States.  Most of these were caused by handguns, which   unlike hunting rifles are only designed to KILL HUMANS!   Handgun owners citing "protection" are twice as likely to have their own weapon used against them.  The second amendment does not guarantee civilian access to 9mm's, despite the NRA's claims.  A handgun ban in America would likely have prevented the Virgina Tech tragedy.


Supporters of this cause understand the balance between civil liberties and human life.  We agree that "liking guns" is not a valid reason to own one.  

1. Handguns are unnecessary and counter-productive to civilized society

2. Innovative discourse will lead to new methods of securing civilian life</description>
