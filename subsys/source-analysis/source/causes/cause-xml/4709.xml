  <description>Southern Poverty Law Center's programs include Teaching Tolerance. an educational program dedicated to helping teachers across the nation foster respect and understanding among their students. Tolerance.org is a Web-based initiative that seeks to awaken all people to the problems of hate and intolerance and prompt them to action. Both programs combat the causes of hate, a mission that is vital to our country's future. Teaching Tolerance is one of the nation's leading providers of anti-bias resources, both in print and online. 

It's award-winning Teaching Tolerance magazine, distributed free to more than 500,000 teachers, gives classroom teachers practical ideas for promoting an appreciation of diversity and the values of democracy. The Intelligence Project monitors hundreds of hate groups and tracks extremist activity throughout the United States. It provides comprehensive updates to law enforcement, the media and the general public through its quarterly magazine, Intelligence Report. Center attorneys handle innovative cases that few lawyers are willing to take. They specialize in using novel legal strategies to cripple hate groups by suing them for the violent actions of their members. The Center fights all forms of discrimination and works to protect society's most vulnerable members.
