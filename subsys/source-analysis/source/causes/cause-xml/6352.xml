  <description>This cause is dedicated to all the innocent Children we have lost or who are struggling due to Shaken Baby syndrome. We are trying to get the word out on how devastating the effects of shaking a child can do and how it is not right! These children are innocent and have no harm to cause for that harm to be caused to them. 

We need more help and education for parents in distress. We need help to educate people on stress relieving ways and how to deal more calmly with a crying or needy child. They have to be educated that a childs way of crying and tantrums is NOT to hurt them and they will get over it, unfortunatly they will not get over the effects of shaken baby syndrome. It is normal for a child to cry and act out. It is normal for a parent to get upset, but there is no excuse for hurting a child who does not have enough strength in the world to fight back! And if at any time you feel like getting physical, put the child in a safe place and walk away. 

Please help spread the word and God bless all the children we have lost, and all the ones struggling from this cruel and unnecessary crime!

1. More Education on how devastating shaking a child could be should be put out for the whole worlds eyes to see.

2. We have to fight to make sure we help people understand and decrease the number of shaken babies.

3. Shaken baby syndrome is a CRIME! And anyone who puts a part in it should suffer VERY serious penalties, even attempted murder and murder! Because every parent knows the effects and knows what they are risking! </description>
