  <description>I believe God intended for marriage to be between a man and a woman. Homosexuality is the perversion of his plan and I disagree with it, but we shouldn't harm the people who have fallen to this idea. God would want us to show them love and explain or argue with them, without discrimination or violence, that they are wrong.

I would like to remind you all as you post items on his board that this is a CHRISTIAN group. Please refrain from cursing or bashing other people. Also remember that this group is not a hate-fest against homosexuals. It is a protest, but God says we should love everyone as we love ourselves and that means no hazing. Feel free to argue and debate as you feel led to do but I would just ask that, as you do, you would keep in mind two things:

1. think about what you are saying and argue with reason and support. Please do not just throw random stabs at people or ideas and be prepared to defend what you say.

2. Keep your arguing clean: without cursing or insults at any other member's character or belief UNLESS you are arguing about their religion. The fallacy of Poisoning the Well is attacking a person's moral character irrelevantly and i would like everyone to refrain from it.

1. God intends for marriage to be between a man and a woman

2. We must stop homosexuality in a way that is honoring to God

3. We must exhibit Christ's love no matter what</description>
