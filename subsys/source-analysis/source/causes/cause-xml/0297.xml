  <description>Over the past few years Scientology has come to the forefront of popular culture due to the odd behavior of its high profile members. For those who have done research into the subject, they will have most likely found this "religion" to be incredibly ludicrous. This is not a fundraising group, but rather a group to raise awareness about what Scientology truly is and what happens behind its closed doors.

1. Educate and inform about the beliefs and practices of Scientology.

2. Expose the corruption within this so called "religion".

3. Show how the Church of Scientology has destroyed the lives of countless individuals.</description>
