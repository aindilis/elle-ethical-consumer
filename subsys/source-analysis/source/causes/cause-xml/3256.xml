  <description>Across America, thousands of disabled individuals-- children, students, and adults-- suffer from inequality due to physical or mental disability.  Sometimes it is as simple as a lack of appropriate facilities, an inaccessible doorway or elevators too far away to be convenient for those with disability.  Other times, disabled individuals are denied a job despite laws to stop discrimination based on disability.  Students suffer from lack of accommodations to help them to succeed in schools and universities. The National Council For Support of Disbilities Issues (NCSD) helps to advance public attitudes, awareness, respect, consideration and advance the success of people with all types of disabilities.  The organization is made up of mostly disabled inviduals and is a nonprofit organization.

1. Provide a means for sharing information, resources, ideas and support between people with all types of disabilities.

2. Encourage and support people with disabilities to reach economic independence through opportunities in education, information and employment.

3. Provide information on current legislative issues that affect civil rights, accessibility and the safety of people with disabilities.

4. Advance the attitudes, consideration, respect and awareness of the general public toward people with all disabilities, by demonstrating their abilities, talents, skills and capability.</description>
