  <description>Child abuse is reported on an average of every 10 seconds and three children die every day as a result of such abuse.  

The Sad Truth.  
Unfortunately, for every child they serve, they know there are countless more who need their help. Funding cuts have been dramatic over the course of the past decade and the money to pay for the services these children so desperately need has dwindled. Additionally, government funding does not support the full range of services necessary to assist families in providing safe, nurturing care and education for their children, or, when necessary, to develop an alternative permanency option. In 2005, only 60% of our services were covered by the Department of Human Services and the Department of Education.  The rest will be covered by private donations. Together our community helps Tennyson Center provide nutritious meals, shelter, clothing, education, and counseling to some of Colorado&#8217;s most severely abused children.  For many years this agency has been the &#8220;last chance&#8221; for these children, after they have experienced failure in other treatment programs or placements. We hope you will join us in giving these children that chance at a full and productive life.
