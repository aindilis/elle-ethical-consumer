  <description>What is Female Infanticide.... "Female infanticide is the intentional killing of baby girls due to the preference for male babies and from the low value associated with the birth of females." (Marina Porras, "Female Infanticide and Foeticide".)
This mostly happens in China and India.
Families throw little girls out on the streets or if not killing them. We need to be aware of this. And do something about it! I plan to start an orphanage in china.
