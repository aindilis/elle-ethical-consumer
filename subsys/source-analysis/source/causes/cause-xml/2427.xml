  <description>Mano en Mano is a non-profit organization with it's primary focus on poverty in Nicaragua.

Our goal is to raise global awareness to places that may get less attention than (for ex) Africa, and see that Nicaragua (for ex) is suffering as well.

The money donated goes 100% to the donator's choice of:
-school funds for secondary education
-house building
-food and nutrition
-medical needs
