  <description>Cancer that forms in the tissues of the vagina (birth canal). The vagina leads from the cervix (the opening of the uterus) to the outside of the body. The most common type of vaginal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, which starts in the thin, flat cells lining the vagina. Another type of vaginal cancer is adenocarcinoma, cancer that begins in glandular cells in the lining of the vagina. Cancerous masses can be detected early enough if you get regular check-ups and  though there is no cure, there are a few options for people with vaginal cancer, depending on what stage they are in.
