  <description>&lt;a href="http://www.precursorblog.com/node/351"&gt;Net Neutrality is a myth&lt;/a&gt;, it has never existed and never should exist. The internet runs because large companies operate backbones that their customers pay them money to use. Large and small companies have already found that you have to pay to play in the internet, especially if you want quality service.
No backbone in their right mind is going to attempt to blackmail yahoo/hotmail nor anyone else into paying more money to use their networks. 

Don't buy into the propaganda!

1. Net Neutrality is a Myth

2. The Government should not regulate the internet</description>
