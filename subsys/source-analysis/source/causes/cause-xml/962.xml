  <description>Over the last few years, the Papermill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey, has experienced financial difficulties. This past year, it has almost resulted in a complete closure of the theater, however, it has gotten a temporary stay to finish its current season and possibly host a shorten theater schedule next year. The theater still needs to raise almost $1.5 million to be out of danger. 

The theater is relying heavily on private bank loans and the local government to save it. All monies which will eventually need to pay back.

For many of us growing up in New Jersey, Papermill Playhouse was were we saw our first professional plays on classtrips. It has long made theater an affordable part of our lives.
