  <description>My friend has type 1 diabetes and when we were camping i watched her inject herself with insulin, and though she denies it it look so painful. But even then, painful or not, that would be a hassle to check your blood and inject yourself. So I'm starting this cause to find a cure for Diabetes so my friend and everyone else  with Diabetes can be free from this harassment.    

1. Will Help find a cure for diabetes

2. It's not fair that some people have to inject themselves:(</description>
