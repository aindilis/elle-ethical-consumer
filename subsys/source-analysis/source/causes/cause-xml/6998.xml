  <description>Millions of Iranians face the same fate as the Iraqi people should America and its allies attack Iran. Thousands of US troops would again find themselves in foreign lands fighting an unnecessary war. We say WAR is not the answer, diplomacy is the key to bringing peace to the region. If this war were to take place, the regional instability that follows could lead to a third World War. 

Lets all support this cause and work with us to prevent the United States from attacking Iran. The good people of America do not want another war. The Iranians do not want war and would like to normalise relations with the United States.

Support the Cause! 

1. Diplomacy is the only road to sustained peace

2. The US and Iran should hold talks to plan peaceful coexistence 

3. UN should not impose further sanctions against Iran</description>
