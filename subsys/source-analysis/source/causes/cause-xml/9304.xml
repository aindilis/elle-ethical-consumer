  <description>Around the world hundreds of beaches are beautiful, many are romantic, or tropical some are even considered hidden treasures. Across the street from these beautiful beaches is usually where the garbage ends up. On this side of the beach most animals gather avoiding larger predators "us".   

People can get lazy, even ignorant, leaving trash behind every day. Who cleans up the beach you might ask? Some beaches have their own clean up crews but others don&#8217;t. It is up to you to keep your beach clean.

Watching a seagull chocking on a cigarette lighter had put (me) over the edge.
