  <description>Chris Perry, Elijah Baik, Paul Chang, along with a group of seven other team members are traveling to various towns and villages. It is hard to narrowly define what exactly the Yucatan Mission Team plans to do. From cutting hair, donating drugs and medical supplies, teaching English, leading games, and rebuilding the existing churches, the Yucatan Mission Team's ultimate goal, the bottom line, is this: spread God's Love. Whether it be through a simple gesture or an afternoon meal spent together, we, the Yucatan Mission Team, hope to be a testimony of Love to all that we meet.

1. Love is louder than words, it's action.

2. Our actions speak God's Love.

3. It is our duty as Christians to spread the Light to the places that have not felt its warmth.</description>
