Doctors needed to give cholesterol screenings

We want to help people who are poorly educated in matters of pathologies of the heart and bring awareness and a chance for people to get their cholesterol levels tested.

1. We believe heart disease can be prevented

2. We believe anyone can join in on the fight for a healthy heart
