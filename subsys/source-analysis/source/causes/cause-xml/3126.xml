  <description>According to the National Abortion Federation, one in three American women will have an abortion by the age of 45. In today's society many people view abortion as an effective means of birth control or as an easy way to "erase" a mistake. A life is created at the moment of conception who has the same right to life as everyone else. This group is all about giving a voice to those voiceless children caught between life and death decisions, and advocating the decision to choose life. 

All donations are tax deductible and benefit the Central Indiana Crisis Pregnancy Center. Their mission statement reads, "The Central Indiana Crisis Pregnancy Center affirms the value of life by providing a network of care to those experiencing pregnancy-related crisis and by compassionately presenting Biblical truth, resulting in changed lives to the glory of God." If you have been blessed with an abundance of money or even just a few dollars, think of the difference we could make!! 

UPDATE: As of 7/11 we have broke 500 members!! Awesome!! I do not know most of you but I just wanted to say thank you to all of you for joining this cause..I do believe us young people could change the world someday!
