  <description>The nation is divided. Most people are dissatisfied with the current Republican administration, and the current Republican candidates for the Presidency do not offer sufficient change or a drastic departure from our current place on the international stage. Also, none of the GOP candidates are competative when compared to the popularity and financial attributes of the Democratic forerunners.  For these reasons, I can say (with some certainty) that a Democrat will be our next president.  Among the Democrats leading the race, Barack Obama is the most worthy of the office of President of the United States of America. 

"Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation - not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago." - Senator Obama

1. Barack Obama is the most qualified candidate to lead the United States for the next four to eight years, considering the challenges facing the U.S.

2. All of Obama's competition is deficient in comparison.

3. If a Democrat is to be the next president, regardless of your political affiliation, support the best candidate: Barack Obama.</description>
