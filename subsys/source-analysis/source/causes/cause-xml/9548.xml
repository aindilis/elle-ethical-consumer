  <description>Christianity has steered away from the very core of Jesus' teaching, which was based mainly around love. So its time we check ourselves and start caring more for all of the people we come in contact with on a daily basis. We are supposed to be the most forgiving, caring, loving people around but in all reality christians are some of the most judgemental, selfish, and inconsiderate people around....so lets change it people!

1. Love each other

2. go out of your way to help others

3. forgive people who have done something to you or that you dont agree with</description>
  <mission>remind each other that the greatest of all commandments that Jesus gave was to love each other, so stop doing so much condemning and do some more loving.</mission>
  <name>'Love.." There is no greater commandment."</name>
