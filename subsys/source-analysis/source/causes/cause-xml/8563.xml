  <description>It's been more than four years since the violence began in Darfur. Over 400,000 innocent men, women and children have been killed and more than 2.5 million people have been driven from their homes.  Millions more face death, rape, torture, and disease.  

In anticipation of the July 22nd anniversary of Congress' recognition of the situation in Darfur as a "genocide," the Save Darfur Coalition has launched a PSA campaign to raise awareness of the crisis in Darfur and increase the pressure on world leaders to act. Please help us seize this opportunity to remind our leaders and the American public that the "genocide" is still raging and to help finally put a stop to these atrocities before more lives are lost.
