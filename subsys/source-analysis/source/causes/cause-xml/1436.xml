  <description>The Working Families Party is a grassroots, community and labor based political party. We combine political work and issue advocacy through fusion voting. We interview candidates for political office, endorse the ones that share our agenda, and work to win votes for them on our ballot line. Using the votes on our ballot line to demonstrate the demand for action on the issues working families face, we lobby for progressive legislation that will make a difference in the lives of working families.

1. Vote on the Working Families line! Our votes count for good candidates -- but they also send a message about issues that matter.

2. We believe everyone deserves a fair shake, and that it's time for an economy that puts people before profit

3. We believe in affordable health care, quality education, fair taxes, living wage jobs, and a better democracy.</description>
