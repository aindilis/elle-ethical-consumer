  <description>Invisible Children: Rough Cut is a documentary recorded in 2003 based on the experiences of three college students (Jason Russell, Bobby Bailey, and Laren Poole) in Northern Uganda. The filmmakers are from San Diego, California in the United States. They went to Uganda to see what they could film, and they found thousands of people affected by the insurgency of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The resulting story focuses on the war's effects on children, particularly child soldiers.
They found that thousands of children flee their homes nightly in order to escape being abducted. Children in Uganda are regularly abducted by the LRA to be trained as child soldiers. The children who run from their homes walk miles to find shelter in hospitals or bus parks - virtually anywhere far away from rebel camps.
   All donations will go to the education and awareness of this terrible travesty, allowing college students to travel to Northern Uganda and make a difference.
