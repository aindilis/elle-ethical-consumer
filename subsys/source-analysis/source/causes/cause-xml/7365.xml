  <description>In the first two years since its founding, the Crossroads of hope has raised over $31,000 to benefit over 100,000 children in rural China which was used to give scholarships, educational materials, establish libraries, and buy newspapers and school supplies. 

Though China is often seen as rising power in the international world, much of China still remains impoverished, especially in western provinces where the land is poor, minorities live, where the yearly family income of most families is less than 1900 RMB (about $250). 

The Crossroads of Hope is not only a fundraising project, but is also established to raise awareness and cultural understanding. Now an international organization, we not only hope to help the children, but also to bridge the cultural gap between the East and the West.

Currently, the project is only active in China, but if you would like to start Crossroads in another country, contact us! Or, if you'd like to help with the current location in China, you can help by donating to help these kids who want to have an education more than anything. Or, start a chapter in your area!
