  <description>Seventeen percent of the entire population of Central America live in Honduras, but over 60% of its AIDS cases are found there.  This fact is made all the more real when you visit Monta&#241;a de Luz (literally, "mountain of light"), a non-profit hospice for children with HIV/AIDS.  There, children are cared for and loved, and given clean water, food, and medication.  About once a month, service groups from the states visit Monta&#241;a de Luz to help with projects and, of course, meet with the children.  It really is just like a big family there, and everyone, even if you're only there for a week, is included.  It's easy to forget why these children are there sometimes, as they are completely filled with life.  But for most, this is only because of the medical care that is nearly impossible for them to recieve any other way.  

There are many ways to help.  Visit Monta&#241;a de Luz's website, www.montanadeluz.org, for more information, or contact me for a personal account.

1. Making medical care available in a family-like environment

2. To build a bridge between all partners and participants in this project and the people of Honduras.

3. To educate the people of Honduras about HIV/AIDS, fallacies and myths about the disease, means of controlling the spread of the disease, and compassion and care for those with the disease.

4. To provide a full range of opportunities for stateside organizations and individuals to be involved</description>
