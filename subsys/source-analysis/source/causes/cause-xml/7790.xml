  <description>If you love animals please take the time to go to SHAC.net ( Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty ) over 500 animals are dying a day 70,000 isolated at Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS), Europe&#8217;s largest contract animal testing laboratory, or go to animalliberationfront.com and make a difference in innocent animals lives that are killed each day for yuppie cosmetics.  (Volunteer! I'ts life changing for both you and our society aswell as innocent animals) If that isn't convincing, thousands of animals had been experimented on at Huntingdon to test an artificial sweetener sucralose, these were particularly nasty experiments carried out on dogs, monkeys, rabbits, rats and mice. One of the aims of the experiments was to see the effect on the central nervous system of the animals and in turn the animals were given massive doses of sucralose! What does testing on animals have anything to do with human used products and cosmetics?!?! Well, NOTHING, we're completely different species and scientists have stated the insignificance in testing on animals, proving that lab tests on innocent creatures gives no true approval of products to the public as "safe". Our products can still harm us, so stop the cruelty to animals, STOP HLS FROM HAVING FUN AND CALLING IT WORK AND EFFECTIVE. EVERY PETITION SIGNED COUNTS, EVERY DONATION WILL CAUSE HLS TO GO FURTHER INTO DEPT, AND FURTHER INTO EXTINCTION!!

1. Huntingdon Animal Cruelty must end immediately

2. Fight untill every cage is empty!

3. Animal liberation must begin </description>
