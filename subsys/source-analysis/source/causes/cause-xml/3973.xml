  <description>On July 25th, 2006 A.D. Harold Reynolds was fired from ESPN.  The reason he was fired was supposed "sexual harassment." Mr. Reynolds claims that it was a hug that was misinterpretted and tried everything to clear his name of this mishap. But ESPN would have none of it.  Baseball Tonight, once led by Harold Reynolds, soon turned to mush after several canidates including Tino Martinez and other latino players tried to fill the shoes left by the sweetest baseball mind of our time. Now ESPN has replaced Mr. Reynolds with Steve Phillips who is possibly one of the biggest idiots alive. Does a GM who couldn't win with $100+ million a year to spend get anyone excited about baseball? No. So put down your global warming posters, quit bitching about Iraq, and join a fight that will make the world a better place for you and future generations

1. Harold Reynolds was fired unjustly
