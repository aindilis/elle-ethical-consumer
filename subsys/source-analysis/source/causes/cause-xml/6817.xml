  <description>The Internal and Foreign Affairs Union is has been created 2 years ago and has finally been given an opportunity to publish our services of this Union to become Global.

Our services help those who have certain cases with your government, other governments, law and order, travel (passports) and transportation, Identifications and legislations etc.

Our qualified people use their skills and knowledge to help you and others address certain cases to whom ever it may concern if you have any concerns or problems even conflict of interests we are ideal for.

Our services are normally based in dealing with Police and how they action with the Laws and Rules of their country/state in the public.

We get referred your cases from the Human Rights Union (based in new zealand). This is so the Human Rights Union Delegate or Lawyer can process and publish information that they have obtained from you into a clear case for us.

1. Working together with other Unions and Human Rights Campaigns

2. Enforce Law and Order in different countries/states etc

3. Defend the clients reputation and confidentiality of a conflict of interest or interest of a case/issue</description>
