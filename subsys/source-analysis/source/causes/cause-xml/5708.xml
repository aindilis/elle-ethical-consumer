  <description>So many people do not understand the concept of why we are fighting in Iraq. On 9/11 we were attacked by terrorists harboring in Afganistan. Once inside of Afganistan we learn that Saddam Hussein was supporting the terrorists efforts from a far. In order to stop him from continuing, we had to invade Iraq and stop his power trip. After he was caught and executed people ask why we cant leave now. Well the answers simple. Not only are there crazy radicals still running the streets but you can not just leave a society ungoverned. If you do another person will see the oppurtunity to rise up and take power and do exactly what Saddam perform. Our mission at Finish What We Started is to keep the hopes going in the troops. America has slowly lost its support for our own soldiers and we want to change that. For the money raised we will be sending the soldiers items that will help brighten their day, and show them America is on their side.
