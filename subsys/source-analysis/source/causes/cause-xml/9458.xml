  <description>Hi all, My dog has been missing from yarmouth town from Prince street since Sunday night. She is a sheltie in other words, looks like the dog Lassie that most of us watched younger... She is brown, orange, black, white, just like Lassie but smaller in size. She is a nervous dog so if you see her, call her gently and she may come. If someone has already seen her roaming the roads of yarmouth please let me know where and when, it will give me something to work with and where to go see... We have a team of family members and friends looking everywhere for her... I have called the spca, rcmp if there was anything found... I announced it on cjls also...  My parents live in Rockville and that is where my dog lives so maybe if someone from Rockville has seen a dog like that, please let me know....  You may call any of these phone numbers, 749-6522, 740-5174, 748-5220, 749-0826 and leave a message is no one answers... Thank you
