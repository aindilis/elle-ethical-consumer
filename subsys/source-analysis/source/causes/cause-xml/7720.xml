  <description>In our crazy crazy world people have become stressed and silly. And not only that but we have people telling us what to do the whole time "Don't touch that, Don't drink that, Don't do that!".
But why do we care! Why do we run around like retards? 
We should all just relax and do what makes us happy.
No worries!

1. People should be able to do what they want, so long as it doesnt hurt someone else

2. Happiness before money!

3. Just relax man!</description>
