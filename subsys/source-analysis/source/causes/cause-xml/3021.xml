  <description>Walk a Mile in his Shoes was developed in 1999 as a joint project of the Newfoundland and Labrador Division of the Canadian Cancer Society and the Prostate Cancer Support Groups of Newfoundland and Labrador.

 

Walk a Mile in His Shoes is a community walk with goals to raise money to support the fight against prostate cancer, and to raise public awareness around the prevention and early detection of prostate cancer.

 

The walk was designed to bring together people living with prostate cancer, survivors of the disease, and families and communities to join in the fight against prostate cancer, which affects 1 in 8 men in this province.   


 
Together, we can make prostate cancer history!
