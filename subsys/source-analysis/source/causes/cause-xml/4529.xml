  <description>Shanti Charities is a non-profit organization that strives to make the community a safer place by teaching individuals how to take care of themselves and help others in the time of an emergency. With backgrounds ranging from medicine to community service, we are a diverse group of volunteers that believe everyone should have the ability to save lives and the opportunity to learn how to live a healthy lifestyle. Shanti Charities currently holds an array of free classes to promote these causes.
