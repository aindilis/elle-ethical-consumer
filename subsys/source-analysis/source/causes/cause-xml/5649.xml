  <description>Bullying. Almost everyone has been a victim, a bully, or both. For too long, many have been ignoring the psychological effects bullying can have on an individual especially the children. I want you to remember all the school shootings in the past 20 years. What were most of them caused by? Disturbed kids who were bullied and decided to get revenge. Many believe bullying is a part of growing up. They were wrong then and they are DEAD WRONG NOW!!! School shootings are on the rise, youths committing suicide is on the rise, all sorts of problems are on the rise that bullying seems to have a link to. If not treated, these problems can lead to problems later on in life including, drug abuse, suicide, depression, school drop outs are rising partially due to this problem, students grades lower due to the stress of bullying, the victim can even become hostile towards others and revert to an autistic state. The problem is becoming worse and hardly anyone is thinking about this problem. There are many problems that the world must think about solving. Well ladies and gentlemen, this is one of them. Help me stop bullying not only on the playgrounds, but online and everywhere else where this problem can be preventable.

1. We are strongly against bullying and enough is enough!

2. Bullying can have harsh effects on the victims later in life.

3. This problem is worse than what many think.</description>
