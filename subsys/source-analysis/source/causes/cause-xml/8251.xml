  <description>Primary and Secondary Brain Tumors

A tumor that begins in the brain is called a primary brain tumor. In children, most brain tumors are primary tumors. In adults, most tumors in the brain have spread there from the lung, breast, or other parts of the body. When this happens, the disease is not brain cancer. The tumor in the brain is a secondary tumor. It is named for the organ or the tissue in which it began.

Treatment for secondary brain tumors depends on where the cancer started and the extent of the disease.
