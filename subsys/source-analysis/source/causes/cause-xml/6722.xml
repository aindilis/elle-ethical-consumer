  <description>Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited mental impairment. This impairment can range from learning disabilities to more severe cognitive or intellectual disabilities. FXS is the most common known cause of autism or "autistic-like" behaviors. Symptoms also can include characteristic physical and behavioral features and delays in speech and language development.

How is Fragile X Syndrome Inherited? It's in the DNA

Fragile X syndrome is transmitted from parent to child through the genetic information (DNA) that is present in the sperm and eggs.

Mutations

Perhaps the most complicated part of the inheritance of fragile X syndrome is that the FMR1 gene can be unstable, which leads to frequent changes (mutations). 

There can be a family with no history of fragile X syndrome in which it suddenly appears in a number of offspring.

Since the FMR1 gene is on the X chromosome, and since it has a tendency to mutate once it has become a premutation, the patterns of inheritance for fragile X syndrome are complex.

F.Y.I. males are more affected my this syndrome simply because they only have one x chromosome. 

1. Many members of my family have fragial x. So it's a personal thing.

2. It's difficult to have children because no one would ever want to have children knowing that they could be mentally ill so if there is a way to prevent this condition genetically spreading to the offspring through the parents DNA, I believe any one would </description>
