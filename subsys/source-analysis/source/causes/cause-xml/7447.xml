  <description>I have been endorsed by the Greens for the Federal seat of Grayndler (Sydney). My cause is to build an army of friends, supporters and VOTERS to get myself elected. 

As a Marrickville resident of 18 years and as a councillor over the past 3 years, I have come to know the real concerns and frustrations of the people of Grayndler. 

 A part of the frustration is related to over a decade of Howard rule. The other part has a lot do with lack of representation and voice.

 

Grayndler has always been a safe Labor seat and this has resulted in a factional empire that prefers numbers over clear vision for the area.

The people of Grayndler deserve a fresh vision, action and results.
