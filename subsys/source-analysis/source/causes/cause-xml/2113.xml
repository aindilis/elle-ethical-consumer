  <description>Through out history more people have died in the name of a supreme being than for any other reason.  Many today have seperated themselves between and from religion, and tensions have risen.  There is no reason for this, which is where I step in.  I am one single man, who believes that it is possible for us all to live in harmony with each other.  Hindu, Christian, Atheist, Buddhist; we all share the same planet, we are all the same species, so why not work for the future, work for our children, work for understanding, work for peace.

1. Religion is a choice, and everyone's choice must be respected, not necessarily agreed with.

2. As many have shown before us, it is possible for opposing religions to be respectful and peaceful towards each other.

3. If possible, show the ignorant how to be respectful to those of different religious views.</description>
