  <description>The Florida Marlins only need about $30 million more to build their own retractable-roof stadium which would ensure their existence in South Florida for the next 30 years, thereby allowing the team to offer long-term contracts to Dontrelle Willis and Miguel Cabrera giving the organization a greater chance at winning  and defending a World Series title without hesitation of great financial loss. In order to make this a legitamate cuase, a non-profit organization must be picked so lets go with the Florida Marlins Community Foundation to help revive baseball in inner cities.

1. Florida Marlins rule.

2. Everything is better in air-conditioning

3. Basbeall beats bears....baseball beats Battlestar Galactica.</description>
