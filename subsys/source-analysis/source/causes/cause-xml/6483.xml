  <description>Too often we overlook the children we see in America. To many they believe, or want to believe that they have a good home, a warm bed, and someone to sing them to sleep at night. That is almost never the case. Instead there are children that might have a home, but is abused and sexually molested by their adult figures, they might even have to go home to two parents passed out at the kitchen table from the amount of drugs and alcohol in their system. Some children are even fending for themselves and living off the streets. Our goal is to end this, to do whatever it takes to help them. Maybe the next time you see a child you'll stop and think just what is hidden behind their mask.

1. Helping any child that is neglected by society.</description>
