  <description>Maryland is one of 37 states where capital punishment is legal.  In 2007, more than three dozen law enforcement officials, including former and sitting state's attorneys, police and corrections officers, and former prison wardens sign onto a letter calling for the full repeal of Maryland's death penalty.  The letter is introduced to the General Assembly at a press conference in Annapolis, and marks the emergence of new "unlikely" voices joining the call for repeal. 

Constituents flood the General Assembly with phone calls and letters urging their support of repeal, creating an intense pressure-cooker, particularly in the Senate, where the vote count is the most uncertain.  In this tense environment, Senate Judical Proceedings Chair Brian Frosh calls the repeal bill to a vote where it fails to pass out of committee in a heartbreaking 5 - 5 deadlock.


1. The death penalty is not an effective crime deterrent.

2. The death penalty is more expenseive than a life sentence without parole.

3. Any error in exercising the death penalty is irreversible.</description>
