  <description>This plan may work. Read and see if you want to join us! Gas is currently $3.59 for regular unleaded in my town. The oil companies and the OPEC nations have conditioned us to think the cost of a gallon of gas is CHEAP at $1.50 - $1.75, we need to take aggressive action. We control the marketplace..... not sellers. With the price of gasoline going up more each day, we need to take action. One way we may see the price of gas come down is if we hit the biggest companies in the pocketbook by not purchasing their gas! We can do that without hurting ourselves. Since we all rely on our cars, we can't stop buying gas, but we CAN have an impact on gas prices if we act together. Here's the idea:

For the rest of this year, don't purchase gasoline from the two biggest companies (which now are one!), EXXON and MOBIL.
If they are not selling any gas, they will be inclined to reduce their prices If they reduce their prices, the other companies will have to follow suit.

But to have an impact, we need to reach literally, millions of Exxon and Mobil gas buyers. It is simple to do! But we really need to stick together at this point .... keep reading and you will see how easy it is to reach millions of people.

How long would all that take? If each of us sends this out to ten more people within one day of receipt, 300 MILLION people could conceivably be contacted within the next 8 days!
Acting together we can make a difference. If it makes sense to you, pass it on. The goal is not to buy from EXXON/MOBIL UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO THE $1.00 TO $1.30 RANGE AND KEEP THEM DOWN.

This can work.

1. Gas prices are rediculously high

2. If we all ban MOBIL and EXXON

3. We will force them to lower</description>
