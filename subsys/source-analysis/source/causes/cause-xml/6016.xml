  <description>The North Fraser Therapeutic Riding Association established in 1973, is a non-profit, charitable organization that provides safe professional therapeutic equine activities enriching the lives of physically, emotionally and developmentally challenged individuals through social, recreational and national competitive riding programs.
NFTRA provides its services to riders from communities surrounding Vancouver, Mission, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody, Burnaby and North and West Vancouver.
Effective April 1st, 2007, the North Fraser Riding Association (NFTRA) is engaged in a capital campaign to purchase the property that they currently lease. For a number of years, NFTRA has leased the 10 acre property that the owners are now wishing to sell. NFTRA is now endeavoring to raise the down payment to purchase the property, thereby ensuring the continuation of their invaluable program.
The NFTRA is now at risk of being shut down and needs your help, and your donation to keep its program and its doors open. Please visit www.nftra.ca and make a tax deductible donation, or by email at: nftra@shaw.ca or by phone 604.462.7786. Additionally, you can also contact the official voice of the NFTRA and Miss BC Contender, Shaela Rae Wlodarczyk @ srw@sfu.ca to make your donation and keep the dream and the spirits of all of its athletes alive.
Many thanks in advance for you participation and donations.
