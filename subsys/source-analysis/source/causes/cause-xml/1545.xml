OPENING DOORS TO SUCCESS 
Sponsors for Educational Opportunity is the nation&#8217;s premiere summer internship program for talented students of color leading to full-time job offers. Since its inception, SEO&#8217;s Career Program has placed over 4,000 Black, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and Native American students in internships that lead to opportunities in exciting and rewarding careers in the most competitive industries worldwide. Our program is featured in Princeton Review&#8217;s 109 Best Internships in America, and is a gateway to the most coveted and highest paying careers. More than 80% of SEO interns receive job offers from partner firms after their internships. SEO grooms its interns to excel in the workplace and become leaders in their communities who will give back and forge a path to success for the next generation. As a direct result of the Career Program and the high performance of its interns, SEO has significantly increased the number of people of color employed on Wall Street and by major corporations nationwide.
