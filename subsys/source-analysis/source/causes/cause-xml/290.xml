  <description>Breed Specific Legislation refers to laws or directives targeted at a specific breed of dog.  Unfortunately the breed is so loosely defined that the legislation affects a type of dog rather than a specific breed.  Targeting any breed for legislation shows that the legislators have no idea what to do and are incorrectly blaming the dogs for the lack or responsability of the owners. It is not just the American Pit Bull Terrier that is in the cross hairs of the dog haters but many of our favorite breeds.  Breed Specific Legislation causes the death of thousands of innocent dogs. Yours could be next so take action now.
