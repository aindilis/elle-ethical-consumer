  <description>Those with diabetics have it hard enough with the constant blood sugar checking and prickers and shots and pumps and giant needles and such...**shiver, I could never do that myself. knowing a few diabetics, dare i say too well, i have seen first...no second hand what they have to go through on a day to day basis to simply stay alive. now that my seem over-dramatic to some and it kinda is but it can happen. Now back to the cause, what I wish to accomplish with this is a understanding of the difficulties of being a diabetic and the joining of friends to live as normal lifestyle as possible and having a blast while doing so... you don't have to donate money or anything just join and have a blast with us =D. 

1. Those without diabetics must understand the difficulties that those with it undergo

2. dude, I just wanna have a blast </description>
