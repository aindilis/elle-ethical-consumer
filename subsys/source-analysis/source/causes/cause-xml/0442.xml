  <description>New York Blood Center, founded in 1964, has a long and rich history. Yet our mission today remains largely the same as it was four decades ago: to help save the lives of potentially 20 million people by providing high-quality transfusion products and services in the tri-state area. 

As the nation's largest community-based, non-profit, independent blood center, we work hard each and every day to meet our vital, life-saving community mission. We accomplish this through the generosity of nearly 2,000 volunteers each day but also through the diligence of dedicated staff in regional, centralized and specialized departments and operations. 


1. To help promote and educate people about the benefits of blood donation</description>
