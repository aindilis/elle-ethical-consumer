  <description>Climate change is the number one issue we face worldwide. CCAN is leading the fight to make changes locally to alleviate the impact that Maryland, Washington DC, and Virginia are making on global warming. We need a clean energy revolution, and that has to happen at a grassroots level--CCAN is taking the lead to find broad support for a climate change solution.
