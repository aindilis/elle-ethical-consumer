  <description>The State does not provide adequate funding for the level of excellence we expect in Albany schools. Academically, we compare with districts that are supported by significant community funding. Albany has demonstrated again and again a commitment to quality education. While we may not share the demographics of other districts, the fact remains: if we want that kind of education, we have to help pay for it.

1. To assist in restoring programs and mitigating against state budget cuts.

2. To fill the gap between immediate fiscal needs and long-term solutions, so that children don't lose valued programming.

3. To aggressively pursue a wide range of funding sources that effectively meet this community's long-term needs, including grants, individual and corporate donations, scrip, and special events.

4. To draw representation from all sites and to work cooperatively with groups that support excellence, including the district, the Albany Educational Foundation, PTAs, school site councils, and booster organizations.</description>
