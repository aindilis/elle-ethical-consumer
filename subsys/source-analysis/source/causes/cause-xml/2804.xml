  <description>We need to raise awareness and gather as a community (especially with support from the younger crowd) to rise against the developers of Wailea 670 (acres) and Makena Resort who plan to develop all the land from Maui Meadows to Makena. They want to put in 4400 units (mostly luxury homes), a shopping center, and a golf course. Let's not let this happen! Go to SaveMakena.org to find out how to can help by attending meetings and writing to council members! Every little bit makes a difference! 

1. To protect Makena Beach

2. To protect Hawaii's indigenous plants

3. To keep the mainlanders from developing all our land</description>
