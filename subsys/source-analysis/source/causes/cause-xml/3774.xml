  <description>Anime is one of the fastest growing industries in entertainment next to pornography.
The amount of Anime imported to the US and Europe have grown exponentialy over the last 5 years.
Although tremendously popular in those regions many fans in other countries struggle to get their hands on some of the latest Anime and goodies.
We would like to help promote Anime in the West and bring this vibrant artform to more people.
Not only do we help studios in Japan to promote their work but also to spread Japanese culture around the world.
