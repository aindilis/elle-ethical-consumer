  <description>All these animal rights groups are rediculous. They say we can't hunt or fish or trap or eat animals. Why not? It's our God given right. We just aren't out in the woods or on the lake to kill. We love the scenery and the sounds as well. It's time for us sportsmen to say we've had enough of your hippie crap. If we don't stand up for our rights now, our children may not have them in the future.

1. Animals are here to provide for us.

2. Sportsmen help keep the animal population in check.

3. We aren't ruthless killers, we have ethics.</description>
