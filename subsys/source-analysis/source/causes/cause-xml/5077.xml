  <description>Though Thierry Henry's move may be an unpleasant surprise, his service as a gunner for eight years would not last forever. After scoring 226 goals and captaining the North London squad to several honors, Va Va has decided to leave the struggling gunners for a prosperous Barcelona outfit. This cause is calling for all Arsenal supporters to continue to support Thierry Henry through his move as well as all others who wish to pay proper respects to this football legend.

1. Don't bitch about Thierry Henry!

2. Show Barca some love, I know about 2006 but we have to forget about the past

3. Support France for UEFA 2008!</description>
