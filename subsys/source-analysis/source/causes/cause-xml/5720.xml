  <description>The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is both the open hand and the closed fist of the environmental movement.  

If members of Congress move forward on clean energy and global warming bills, we'll work with them.

If they vote in favor of the environment, we'll call them friends.

But if they stand for polluters, not people, we will hold them accountable.

At a time of unprecedented opportunity, when a meaningful bill to cap global warming pollution is finally in reach, the big polluters will not sit quietly.  

As those polluters pour money into Washington to try to block this global warming bill, LCV will stand in their way.  

Join us at http://www.lcv.org.


Our beneficiary, the League of Conservation Voters Education Fund (LCVEF), exists to strengthen the capacity of the environmental movement, to mobilize citizens as informed voters, and to advocate for sound environmental policies.
