  <description>Mainly, this is an awareness page where people can see how ignorantly people treat rabbits.  Just as with dogs and cats, some rabbit abuse cases push these creatures within an inch of their lives, leave them deformed, starving, neglected, etc etc.  This page will also aim to inform people on the joys of owning a domestic rabbit, and the proper care required.  Even feeding your rabbit the wrong thing due to ignorance, shortens their lives drastically!  These are wonderful creatures and wonderful pets, lets share the word!


Links will be available to good vetrinarians, and the house rabbit society pages.

Any donations recieved will go to the House Rabbit Society of North Georgia who desperatly need funding for their hundreds of rescued and protected rabbits.

1. Rabbit Abuse must be taken as a real animal cruelty issue

2. People ignorantly care for domestic rabbits.  Correct information needs to be available and encouraged.

3. Open peoples minds to the simple happiness that these creatures can bring 

4. To do the above mentioned in a friendly and clean atmosphere.  Please no rabbit Haters or swearing on this page.</description>
