  <description>Have you ever heard a Nickelback song and wondered, "Hey, didn't they release that on the last album" or "Wait, isn't that the same chord progression from their last hit?"  Well, I know we have.  The goal of this cause is to remove Nickelback entirely from popular culture, and possibly restore some originality to popular music.

1. Nickelback sucks

2. Nickelback plays variations on one song

3. That song sucks

4. The right to listen to good original music is fundamental

5. Nickelback should be removed from Planet Earth</description>
  <mission>remove Nickelback from all walks of musical culture, and once again attempt to restore originality to music.</mission>
