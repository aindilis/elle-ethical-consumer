  <description>Tapirs are endangered.  Most people have never even heard about them, and their numbers are declining.  There are estimations, but no one is sure on how many Tapirs there are left in our world.  They are simply not researched enough.  We can make a difference.  By spreading the word and donating any amount of money-- small or huge-- we can really help out our friends, the tapirs.

1. There should be an effort made to fund the preservation of Tapirs and thier habitats.

2. We need to let others know about Tapirs, so that they will not go unnoticed.

3. We, as humans, need to acknowledge these animals and not allow them to become extinct.</description>
