  <description>There are hundreds of Lebanese Political detainees in Syrian Prisons. These people were kidnapped, tortured, and held prisoners when they revolted against the Syrian occupation of Lebanon. They have been in prison for years. We want our brothers back!

1. Lebanese Detainees in Syrian Prisons Must Be Freed Immediately!

2. Ask the UN to establish an International Inquiry Commission on this issue</description>
