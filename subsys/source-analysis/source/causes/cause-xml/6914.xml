Class of 2004 gifts to the Brown Annual Fund help advance The Plan for Academic Enrichment by supporting:

- Comprehensive, need-blind financial aid that enables Brown to attract the brightest minds to campus;

- Increased resources for faculty support, including research seed funds and start-up packages that are crucial to attracting and retaining the world's finest scholars &amp; teachers;

- Enhancements to the student living and learning experience, including smaller classes, a broader selection of courses, and expanded research opportunities; and

- Robust library and technological resources that allow students and faculty to work to their highest potential


All donations are tax-deductible.  There is also a new feature on the site where you can set up payment installments &#8211; for example, if you want to give a large amount for the year, but not have it all charged on your credit card at once, you can set up monthly payments until your amount is completed.
 
Make sure you check to see if your employer matches donations.  At most big companies (banks, etc), they will match between 50% and 100% of any charitable donations.  

The BAF has experienced 12 consecutive years of record-setting performance -- let's keep it going!
