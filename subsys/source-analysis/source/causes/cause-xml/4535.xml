<cause>
  <description>Autism is a mental illness that devastates too many children every day. Together we can put an end to this disease. Volunteering is the best way to help the cause, as well as donating to organizations that are dedicated to helping these children. All proceeds from this cause go directly to SARRC, the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center.

1. Autism is a disease that must be stopped

2. We must give our support to places that are offering help to children with Autism</description>
