  <description>I have notice that even today in 2007 we have alot of injustice that is seen but not spoken. Many of our young successful people are being treated unfairly or are targets for racial profiling. We need to all stand up and expose this for what it is otherwise this injustice will never end. Racism is the key to war and violence and it must be stoped!!!

1. Racism must stop.

2. Put racial profiling to an end

3. Expose people of power who are racist</description>
