  <description>We've all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I'm talking of course about... ginger kids. Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles.

This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls. Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike... vampires.

Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one.......think again
