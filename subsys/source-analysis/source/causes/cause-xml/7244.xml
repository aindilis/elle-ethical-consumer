THEY SAVED ME AND TONS OF OTHER TEENAGERS TOO. how could you? how could you take away the ONE thing in this world that dosnt have to mean anything the one thing that is just pure joy. MUSIC. your taking away everything i live/stand for. im a musician and i am 1,000,000,000% against you and all you stand for. YOUR STEALING OUR RIGHTS. YOUR STEALING EVERYTHING AWAY FROM OUR YOUTH. YOUR TAKING EVERYTHING WE STAND FOR AWAY. how.could.you.
