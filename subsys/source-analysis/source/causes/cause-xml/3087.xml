  <description>Central Ontario Leadership Seminars provides 3-day and 1-day seminars to grade 10 Ontario high school students.

Our organization provides this at NO COST to any of the schools or student ambassadors involved. We rely on the donations of generous companies and individuals.

NOTE - the supported organization runs a similar program in the US. When Canadian Charities are supported, I will change it! If you wish to donate to COLS instead, please contact me at ktesz@cols.ca
Thanks!
