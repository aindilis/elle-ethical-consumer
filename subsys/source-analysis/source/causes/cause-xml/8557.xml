  <description>Our Scientific Advisory Committee sits twice a year to evaluate project proposals from some of the world's top scientists. After intense scrutiny we then award grants to those projects that meet our strict criteria. This ensures that AICR funds only research of the highest quality. In 2009 we began funding over 53 new projects worldwide. Our aim in 2010 is to increase this number.
