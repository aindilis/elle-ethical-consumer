  <description>Since 2007, The Real News Network has produced thousands of news reports covering everything from climate change, economic crises, workers rights and community organizers. The Real News reports are viewed more than six million times daily and we are supported largely  by generous support from viewers. No ads. No government support. This funding model allows us to produce uncompromising and fact-based news.  

1. We need a courageous independent media

2. We do news that provides the facts for those who don't want to roll over-who want to take over

3. TRNN is a platform for viewers to debate the solutions to global and domestic problems.</description>
