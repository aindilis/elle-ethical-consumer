  <description>For 12 years we have been going to at-risk communities and working with the forgotten kids of Raleigh NC.

We help with homework, food, bills but mostly we just hang out and let them know how special they are and how much Jesus loves them

1. Jesus died for anyone who wil accept his Gift of eternal life.

2. We must teach the whole world their need of Jesus

3. We must do all we can to help the poor

4. We must make disciples of all nations</description>
