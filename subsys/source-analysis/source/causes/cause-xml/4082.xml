  <description>We are a non-profit organazation that takes care of dogs and cats. We provide food, water, shelter, and companionship for the dogs and cats. Every Saturday we take the animals to the Noblesvillie to try to adopt them out. The money from the adoptions goes toward the vet bills. You can help in many ways such as volunteering or fostering out a dog or a cat. We need food, collars, toys, leashes, and anything else you can imagine for an animal. Please donate to this worthy cause. In this tough economy we really need finalcial help all donations are tax  deductable!
