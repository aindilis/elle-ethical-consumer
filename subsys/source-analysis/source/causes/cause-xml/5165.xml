  <description>The Equality Club's mission is to increase the amount of social acceptance in today's society, and will do that by raising awareness of conditions of other cultures, spreading knowledge about various groups, decreasing the amount of negativity towards others in daily lives, and speaking out against discrimination of any kind. 


Don't worry about donating, yet. Please don't donate! Unless you like Amnesty International, but that is not what The Equality Club is working for. 

1. Every person deserves to be treated fairly.

2. Regardless of race, sex, creed, sexuality, financial class, etc., nobody deserves to be discriminated against.

3. Misunderstanding of other ways of life must be stopped to reduce prejudices.</description>
