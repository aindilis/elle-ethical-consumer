  <description>Here at the Sam Macinsky Foundation, we believe that Sam Macinsky needs more money.  That's right, he just doesn't have enough.  It really bugs him because then he can't do things like take his girl out to movies and such.

Poor Sam, he even gets banished to Canada every now and then with nothing to do and no money to spend.  So please, if you have a heart...give him some money.

---------------------IMPORTANT----------------------
Please note:  All donations MUST be made directly to Sam, do not do it via Facebook.  Send me a message  if you want to know how to donate money or whatever else you might want to donate.  But DO NOT donate via Facebook because the Sam Macinsky Foundation isn't a recognized cause yet so they don't have a method of payment.  It will route your money to disabled veterans instead.

1. Sam Macinsky is a sexy beast and deserves money from strangers.

2. Sam Macinksy does a nice thing every once and awhile for someone other than himself, and therefore deserves as much money as you can bare to part with.

3. Sam Macinsky is so poor it's not even funny.</description>
