  <description>Indiana University Dance Marathon (IUDM) was established to memorialize the courageous life and efforts of Ryan White. Ryan would undergo treatment only at Riley Hospital during his struggle with the AIDS virus because of its unparalleled commitment to its patients, superb doctors, and loving environment. His unselfish friend and Indiana University student Jill Stewart-Waibel created the Indiana University Dance Marathon to commemorate Ryan's battle against infectious diseases. The first annual Dance Marathon was held in October 26,27,28, 1991. Since then, every year hundreds of students get together and sacrifice a weekend of 36 hours to stand and dance for the children of Riley. IUDM gives Indiana students and community members an opportunity to support those in need at the Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. We will continue to support the Hospital's efforts to treat all its patients, regardless of financial concerns. 

1. Every child deserves the best health care.

2. We dance because we can, we stand for those who can't. </description>
