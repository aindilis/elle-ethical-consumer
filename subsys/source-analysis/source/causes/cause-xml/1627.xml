  <description>Stand True Mission Statement
 
We exist first and foremost to glorify God. Through the grace of God, we stand for the protection of  human life from the moment of fertilization to natural death.  Abortion is the act of killing a human person and it is always wrong without exceptions. 
 
We are committed to establishing a culture of life, and bringing light to a generation covered by darkness. We believe that the only true way to end abortion is to turn hearts to Christ.  Though it is important for the unjust laws to change, we must first turn the hearts of our nation. 
 
We are committed to educate, equip and activate young people to stand up and be a voice for their generation.  
 
Until the silent cries of innocent children are finally heard, we will raise our voices, shine our lights, we will Stand True.

Psalms 40:2  He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
