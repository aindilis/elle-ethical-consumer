  <description>Alright people, we all know that Lior is a great kid. He makes Beverly the awesome place that it is. And we also know that a little marijuana here and there isn't gonna hurt anybody. So, since he was caught holding his personal marijuana at school, and severe consequences will most probobly unfold - possible expellsion, arrest, or rejection from any college that he applied to - I SAY WE PROTEST THIS EVIL AND ABSURD CONQUEST TO SHAME AND DESTROY OUR COMMON FRIEND LIOR!

1. Free Lior from any police trouble. 

2. Free Lior from any trouble getting into a college.

3. Free Lior from getting expelled from Beverly. </description>
