  <description>The Libby Ross Foundation was founded in 1999 in loving memory of Elizabeth "Libby" Ross, who lost her battle with breast cancer on July 24, 1998. The Foundation is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization started by Lori Ross and Marla Willner.  Both of the founders have first hand experience with breast cancer in their families, as Lori lost her mother to breast cancer in 1998 and Marla's mother is a two-time survivor of the disease. The Foundation was started to prevent other women and other families from experiencing the devastation of breast cancer by focusing on creating unique support programs and to help eradicate the disease through research and early detection. 



1. We must put an end to breast cancer - 1 in 7 women will be diagnosed in her lifetime.

2. Women who have or who have had breast cancer are greatly in need of our support.</description>
