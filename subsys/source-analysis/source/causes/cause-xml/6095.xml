  <description>Every day people around the world suffer needlessly, through no fault of their own. Many die from diseases that are already curable, simply because they live in a developing country where the proper treatment is not available, or they cannot afford the medical expenses. Everyone Needs a Hero is a non-profit organization, formed in April 2004, dedicated to improving the lives of the disadvantaged, one story at a time. 

Here's our website:

www.EveryoneNeedsaHero.org 

1. Everyone deserves a chance at life, irrespective of where they were born.

2. Those of us who have the ability to help those without those assets should help them. 

3. Anyone can be a hero. </description>
