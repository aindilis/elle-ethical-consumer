  <description>Emmy Award-winning actress Christina Applegate, star of ABC&#8217;s hit sitcom Samantha Who?, returns as the 2009 ambassador for Lee National Denim Day, one of the country&#8217;s largest single-day fundraisers for breast cancer, benefiting the Women&#8217;s Cancer Programs of the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF).  

Denim Day is a simple yet powerful program &#8211; you are teaming up with millions people who have participated over the past 13 years, and all those donations have totaled more than $75 million. With your help, we hope to raise more money and reach more people this year than ever before. 

All you have to do is wear your jeans on Friday, October 2 and donate $5 to the Women&#8217;s Cancer Programs of the Entertainment Industry Foundation and Right Action for Women. You can sign up with your office, with a group of friends or with your family. We look forward to wearing our jeans with you and reshaping the fight against breast cancer! 


1. Support Lee Laboratories nationwide, which work to find more effective, less toxic treatments for breast cancer. 

2. Fund EIF&#8217;s Biomarker Discovery Project, a multi-year effort to develop a blood test for earlier detection of breast cancer

3. Create resources with the National Breast Cancer Coalition to offer individuals with breast cancer evidence-based information, and train advocates

4. And this year, funds will also support Applegate&#8217;s newly launched foundation Right Action for Women. </description>
