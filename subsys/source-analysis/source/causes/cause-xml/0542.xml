  <description>Oceans cover 71 percent of the globe and we are 100% committed to saving them.

Oceana, founded in 2001, is the largest international organization focused solely on ocean conservation. Our offices in North America, Central America, South America and Europe work together on a limited number of strategic, directed campaigns to achieve measurable outcomes that will help return our oceans to former levels of abundance. We believe in the importance of science in identifying problems and solutions. Our scientists work closely with our teams of economists, lawyers and advocates to achieve tangible results for the oceans. 

1. Earth is a water planet - do all you can to protect it.

2. Sea turtles have been around for millions of years but need our help to survive.

3. Don't be scared OF sharks - be scared FOR sharks.

4. Ocean acidification is the evil brother of climate change.</description>
