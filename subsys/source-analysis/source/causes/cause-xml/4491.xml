  <description>Youth Service America (YSA) creates opportunities for millions of young people, ages 5 through 25, across more than 100 countries to participate in service and service-learning programs throughout the year.  

Our most popular program, Global Youth Service Day is the largest service event in the world, and in 2007, more than three million kids in 118 countries developed highly visible projects to fight global climate change, poverty, malaria, illiteracy, HIV-AIDS, hunger, homelessness, water scarcity, etc. 

GYSD will take place on April 25, 26, &amp; 27, 2008!

YSA is launching the first ever Semester of Service in 2008, from MLK Day in January to GYSD in April, encouraging teachers and students to unite 14 weeks of meaningful service with their classroom curricula and measures of academic achievement.

1. Young people can change the world 

2. Youth have amazing energy, commitment, idealism, and ingenuity TODAY

3. With more than half the world&#8217;s population under 25 years old, we cannot afford for young people to grow up before they start tackling the toughest issues facing the planet.</description>
