  <description>The fact of the matter is that our Privates have been in there for too God damn long, and not only has it stopped feeling good, but the war reached its climax long, long ago.  Now these thrusts of troops into Iraq are merely wearing down our national stamina, making it unlikely for another such effort for some time.  If our battleships full of seamen leave but the seed of a U.S. enemy is still planted, do not worry, everything will be just fine, us Democrats believe abortion is always a viable option.
