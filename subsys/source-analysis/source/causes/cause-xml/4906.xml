  <description>I started this cause after seeing how this ministry was helping the homeless of my area. Most of this ministry is run by a husband and wife and funded by them as well. Here is the website of the ministry if you want to check it out- www.seekthelost.org

I think too many of us now a days are ignoring those in need on the streets, yes I understand that we dont want to give them money because we dont know what they might spend it on. I get that, but whats wrong with carrying extra bottles of water with you or chips, who is to say that wont be the only food that they might get that day. 



1. Passing the homeless by in the streets needs to stop. 

2. Feed the homeless spiritually and physically. </description>
