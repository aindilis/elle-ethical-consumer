  <description>The Queen's Pier in Hong Kong is in danger. We cannot neglect it because of the government's unjustifiable decision. The Star Ferry case had aroused people's attention and care, but it was sad that we cannot save it. We have to use our heart and everything we can do to save the Queen.

Stop Hong Kong being a international cold metal business city.

1. The Queen's Pier is a part of Hong Kong history, she is an important witness to all things happened in these 53 years.

2. To arouse Hong Kong conscience, stop destroying memories of Hong Kong.</description>
