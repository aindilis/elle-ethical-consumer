  <description>The brain and spinal cord contain cells called neurons, which send signals within the CNS to other parts of the body. These signals control physical functions, such as balance and muscle coordination, as well as thinking and other abilities. Signals pass through neurons by way of nerve fibers called axons. And, axons are protected by a covering, called myelin, which helps the axons carry signals
With MS, damage to neurons disrupts the body&#8217;s ability to send signals and causes MS-related symptoms. Symptoms may vary because of the location and extent of the damage. Today, researchers believe both inflammation and neurodegeneration contribute to the destructive actions of MS...which can cause numbness.
