  <description>Shriners Hospitals for Children has been providing state-of-the-art care for more than 80 years. Our network of pediatric specialty hospitals focus on orthopaedic conditions, burn injuries, spinal cord rehabilitation, and cleft lip and palate repair.

While providing this high-quality care, we do not face the barriers of insurance industry processes and policies. Because we do not rely on third-party funding by insurance providers or U.S. government agencies for treatment provided by our hospitals, our physicians, nurses and therapists can create and implement a treatment plan without delay.

All children, from birth to 18 years of age, may be eligible for care at Shriners Hospitals if, in the opinion of our doctors, the child can benefit from the specialized care provided by our hospitals.  Eligibility is not dependent on financial need or relationship to a Shriner.

While there are many elements to Shriners Hospitals for Children, there is only one purpose: to improve the lives of children. 


1. All children deserve high-quality health care.</description>
