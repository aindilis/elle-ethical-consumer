My cousin drowned about two months ago. She was only 18 and just had a baby whom she left behind with my 70 something year old grandparents. Some people dont have the resources to learn to swim, the money to go to swim school or pay someone to teach them to swim! IF only she knew how we all wont be mourning her death! My cause will help people of all age, race, religion and country. It will provide them with money for learning how to swim. The money will be directly transfered to the school of learning.This will mostly help people challenged on all walks of life , mentally &amp; financially . 

1. Accidental drowning must never happen!

2. Everyone should know how to swim !

3. Three quarters of our world is water !</description>
