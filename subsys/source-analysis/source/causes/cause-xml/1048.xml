  <description>Support America's workers by supporting labor organizations like the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), one of the country's largest and fastest-growing labor unions. With more and more Americans working more and making less, and our middle class disappearing quickly, workers need the opportunity to join together and speak with one collective voice. By organizing together, workers can improve their work, their communities, and their lives. Unions always have been - and will continue to be - one of the most powerful tools for social justice and equality in America. 

1. Give workers the strength to win better wages, affordable health care, a secure retirement, and safer workplaces.

2. Demand equality in wages and in workplace respect for workers of all genders and nationalities.

3. Hold elected officials accountable, stop the "race to the bottom" by employers who cut wages and benefits in favor of bigger profits, and win improvements such as affordable, quality health care for all.</description>
