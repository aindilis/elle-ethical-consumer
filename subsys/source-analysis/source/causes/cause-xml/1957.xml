  <description>Everything YouthNet does supports young people. Whether they want information, advice or opportunities to contribute to their community, they can come to us. We are here to engage and inspire them, offer them trusted information, and support them through every stage of their lives.

Being online means we are always there when they need us most. We never close, we never switch off. Young people can access our services any time of day or night.

We have two complementary websites: TheSite.org, which provides support and guidance to young people aged 16-24; and do-it.org.uk, which links users to volunteering opportunities, helping them improve their own lives and those of the people around them.

&lt;b&gt;NOTE: FaceBook doesn't currently allow donations to non-US charities so we're currently linking to a US charity in the donations bit!&lt;/b&gt;

1. Young people should be able to make their own choices in life

2. Young people should not be labeled as thugs, hoodies or gang members

3. Information is a right</description>
