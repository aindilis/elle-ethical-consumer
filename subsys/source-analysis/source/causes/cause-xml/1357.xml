  <description>Women&#8217;s empowerment and gender mainstreaming are key to tackling challenges, such as poverty, discrimination, educational gaps, high maternal mortality, disease and other ills, a senior United Nations official has told the world body&#8217;s Commission on the Status of Women.

Despite several promising steps, including increased provision of microcredit and the accession of several States to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), &#8220;challenges remain,&#8221; Rachel N. Mayanja, the Secretary-General&#8217;s Special Adviser on Gender Issues and the Advancement of Women, said at a meeting yesterday.

&#8220;Continued discrimination against the girl child, violence against girls and women, and low representation of women in decision-making&#8221; still pose major problems, Ms. Mayanja said.

Among the almost 50 speakers at the meetings was Noeleen Heyzer, Executive Director of the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), who called for the implementation and monitoring of provisions of treaties targeted at empowering women.



1. Discrimination robs girls and women of the the power to make decisions, to earn a living and to be free from violence, abuse and exploitation. This MUST end IMMEDIATELY

2. Discrimination deprives women and girls of any legal protection.

3. Entire societies develop when girls and women are enabled to be fully contributing community members.</description>
