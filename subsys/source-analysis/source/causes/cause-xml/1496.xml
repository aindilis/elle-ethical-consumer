  <description>The Lebanese Armed Forces' primary missions include; defending Lebanon and its citizens against all aggression, confronting threats against the country's vital interests, maintaining internal stability and security, engaging in social development activities and undertaking relief operations in coordination with public and humanitarian institutions.

The LAF consists of approximately 72,100 active personnel[1] with the Ground Forces consisting of approximately 70,000 troops, the Air Force consisting of approximately 1,100 personnel and another 1,000 in the Navy.

All three branches are operated and coordinated by LAF Command, which is located in Yarzeh, just east of the capital, Beirut. There are a total of six military colleges and schools in the country. Some cadets may be sent to other countries to receive additional training.

The equipment inventory of the LAF is outdated due to a lack of funds, lack of foreign investement, political bickering and until recently the presence of foreign forces. After the conclusion of the Lebanese Civil War the LAF decided to repair as much of its equipment as it could, while being aided by modest donations from other nations. Approximately 85% of the LAF's equipment is US-made with the remaining being British, French, and Soviet-made.
