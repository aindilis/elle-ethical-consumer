  <description>We realize that over 90% of America can be considered stupid, therefore our proposition is simple.
Nuke 'em.
If that doesn't work, because stupid people often amaze us with survival despite overwhelming odds, we will then proceed to send them all to the Sahara desert.
How you may ask.
Well, we will just tell them that Sahara Desert is in fact made up of finally ground gold dust.
But we need your help, our dreams of an Intelligent America can not be realized in our lifetime with the current ratio of Idiots to Intelligent people in America at this moment.  It currently stands at a 9 to 1 ratio. That is simply ludacris.  Join today, and help provide a brighter future for our children, because wouldnt you want to live in a country without idiots?
Join, because we care, and so should you.
Thank you.
