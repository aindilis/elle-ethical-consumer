  <description>When Travis Austin Huse becomes the man in '08, here is what he will work for:

-An end to the drug war.  It's unnecessary and it costs us a ton!
-Complete and utter isolationism.  Who cares?
-I will make Tu B'Shevat a national holiday, replacing Presidents' Day.  Why should we have a day honoring someone who gets paid to be the most powerful man in the world?  Seems like they already get enough publicity, ifyouknowwhaddimean!
-Families choosing not to have children will get an extra tax break.  It's responsibility, guys.  This way, instead of having shitty little brats, you can go kayaking!
-Stem Cell research is a go!
-I will make anything that does not harm others legal.
-I will wear a crown made by none other than Paul Wall.
-I will surgically enhance my height so that I am one inch taller than Shaq, and will gloat that while I have height, I can also make freethrows.
