  <description>People don't realize what they're doing when they get an abortion. It kills a living, growing baby, even if it's still tiny. There are other alternatives than getting an abortion, for example, adoption, but some women are pressured into getting one by their boyfriends or husbands because they don't want to deal with it. Some women unfortunately, aren't pressured into it, and they think that it's the easiest way to deal with it. We would definitely recommend going to the March For Life in Washington D.C. on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade at least once to learn about what you can do to stop abortions

"if the life of the child and/or mother is at risk, everything medically possible must be done to save both. if the child dies anyway, it is tragic, but nothing could have been done. abortion is not justified by "health concerns."
and "if the birth control fails," the true point of sex is to reproduce. sure, it's all fun, but unless you're ready for a child, you should not be having sex, with or without birth control.
there is NEVER an excuse for abortion." - Member of our cause

1. Abortion means killing a child, going against the 10 Commandments

2. Abortion doesn't just hurt the baby, it hurts the mother as well</description>
