  <description>Citizen Schools operates a national network of apprenticeship programs for middle school students, connecting adult volunteers to young people in hands-on learning projects after school. At Citizen Schools, students develop the academic and leadership skills they need to do well in school, get into college, and become leaders in their careers and in their communities. 

Last year, we served 3,000 middle-school students and engaged 2,400 volunteers at 30 sites nationwide. This fall we expand to 36 locations in six states. But we aim for even larger impact. Our program is a model of how out-of-school time can be a powerful opportunity to re-imagine learning, bring communities together, and increase access to the American Dream. Through unique volunteer engagement, staffing strategies, program models, and advocacy, Citizen Schools is at the forefront of a movement to transform education.

Learn more about our programs, our results, our plans to advance the after-school field, and how to get involved at www.citizenschools.org.
