  <description>Jesus House is an inner city, non-denominational, non-profit Christian outreach providing shelter, food, clothing, and goods to the community&#8217;s needy. 
The ministry was founded in 1973 by Ruth Wynne and Betty Adams. Sister Betty joined our Lord in Heaven in 1991, and Sister Ruth joined her in 2002. Many homeless shelters are funded by the government and therefore can only help certain people.  The mentally and physically handicapped are usually left out.  However, the Jesus House receives no federal funding and thus is able to catch those who fall through the cracks.
