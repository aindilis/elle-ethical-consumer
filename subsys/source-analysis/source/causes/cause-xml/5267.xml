<cause>
  <description>This cause is a nonprofit cause which in time, would cater to the needs of many underprivileged people that can be possibly reached through this cause.   Anyone can donate books, disseminate information on topics of history, science, health, current issues and make people aware of the countless opportunities that exist in the world out side of their own limited experiences.  Amnesty International is the non - profit donor to which this group is affiliated and as such, all money donations should be made to that organisation.  Our goal is to send out this S.O.S. to Stamp Out Starvation.  Starvation of knowledge as well as hunger.  This is a cause to promote equality of opportunity in a world of plenty.  

1. Equality of oppurtunity for all

2. Non exclusivity

3. Education is key</description>
