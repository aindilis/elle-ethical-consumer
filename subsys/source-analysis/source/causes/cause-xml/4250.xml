  <description>We are sick and tired of liars who have too much time and money and not any sense at all twisting facts and often times straight out lying about our local government officials.  Let's show a united front in fighting these trouble makers and let them know that their behavior is unacceptable and will NOT be tolerated!!

DOWN WITH LIARS!!!

1. Stand up in town council meetings in solidarity against these liars.

2. Present positive attritubes about the people the liars are lying about.

3. Don't care who knows that you support your local town administrator and mayor!</description>
