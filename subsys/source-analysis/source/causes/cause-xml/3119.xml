  <description>Many people say save the rainforest, but they're full of shit. The fact is, it's humid, crimanals lurk every where, misquitos eat you alive, the tribes there need do get with the fucking program and join us in the 21st century, many people are taken prisoner by militants living in the rainforest, hundreds of various diseases come from the rainforest and over 100 things in the rainforest are proven to cause cancer. 

We need to stop the rainforest before it's to late!

And those worried about the loss of oxygen, it's almost certian that sharper image will invent a machine that makes even better air and has an alarm clock in it.

Join the cause or fuck you!



disclaimer:this cause is just a joke, don't send money in support of joke unless interested in nonprofit organization. The rainforest is good(i guess), and by reading this you have absolved me of all legal infractions in perpatuity throughout the universe motha fuckers.

1. Must have a god damn sense of humor.

2. Misquitos are fucking useless!

3. The rainforest will destroy us if we don't act quickly with bulldozers</description>
