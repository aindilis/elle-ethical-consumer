What is the American Latex Allergy Association?
The American Latex Allergy Association is a national non-profit 501,(c)(3), tax exempt organization that provides educational information about latex allergy and supports latex-allergic individuals. Originally, the organization was formed by a group of approximately 30 health care workers who acquired latex allergy. We sought to provide information and support for one another, as well as to other persons and organizations. Our original name A.L.E.R.T., Inc. continues to reflect our mission: Allergy to Latex Education and Resource Team.
