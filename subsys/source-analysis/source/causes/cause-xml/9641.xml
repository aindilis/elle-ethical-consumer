  <description>Did you watch Planet Earth (in HD) and were you appalled at the fate of poor (endangered) polar bear who starved to death in the face of so many fat seals?

This cause is dedicated to providing cold, raw meals for polar bears in need. 

We aim to meet the dietary needs of Polar Bears to ensure their survival BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY!

1. Polar bears need help, they're STARVING!  (See Planet Earth, the documentary)

2. Man is DESTROYING the Polar Bears' natural food sources!  We MUST replace them!

3. Delivering a meal to a BEAR IN NEED is an honorable cause.</description>
