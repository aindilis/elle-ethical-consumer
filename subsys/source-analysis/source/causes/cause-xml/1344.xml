  <description>Take the Field is a public-private partnership that rebuilds outdoor athletic facilities at New York City public schools. Our aim is to provide safe and attractive facilities for New York City public school students and their communities. 

Before Take the Field entered the picture in the year 2000, almost no public money had been spent on sports facilities and programs in New York City public schools for approximately 25 years. This shortage of funding resulted from the fiscal crisis that began in the mid-1970s.

In just five years, Take the Field's fundraising program achieved the unimaginable by raising $133 million ($97 million public sector/$36 million private sector) to rebuild 43 state-of-the-art outdoor athletic facilities for New York City public schools.

Take the Field has since repaired over 40 fields in New York City.

These beautiful new fields impact the students, the school, and the community. Take the field is a real private initiative that cares about public education. 
-Joel Klein, Chancellor NYC Public Schools
