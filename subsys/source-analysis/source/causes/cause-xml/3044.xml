  <description>Greenpeace, the Union for Concerned Scientists, the World Bank and the Pentagon all agree: global warming is the most serious threat to our planet. 

People are trying to cut their emissions of greenhouse gasses and especially carbon dioxide (CO2) levels by buying "clean" lightbulbs, driving less &amp; using public transportation, conserving forests, advocating for renewable energy, choosing energy-efficient appliances &amp; hybrid vehicles, etc., but we should not overlook what is likely the most significant factor in greenhouse gas production: the animal agriculture industry (a.k.a the meat/dairy industry).


1. Global warming is an increasingly urgent threat to the existence of the planet and its inhabitants!

2. Our actions and decisions now directly affect global conditions for future generations.

3. Factory farming significantly contributes to contamination and pollution of our land, our water, our air, and our bodies. </description>
