  <description>This society was created to educate, inform and give moral support to those who have Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or have a loved one who has MS. This disease is life changing and because of that this groups' goal is to help people cope with and learn to live a normal life with this disease. Any donations will be sent to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society to aid in the search for a cure. Together we can all make a change.

1. MS is a life changing disease.

2. MS will some day soon be cured.</description>
