The Montel Williams MS Foundation was established to further the scientific study of MS in October 2000. The goals of The Montel Williams MS Foundation are to provide financial assistance to select organizations and institutions conducting the most current research, to increase allocations for research from the federal government, to raise national awareness about MS, and to educate the public.

Currently, 100% of the public&#8217;s donations go directly to funding research to find a cure for MS. They are committed to keeping administrative costs as low as possible to remain true to this mission.

To donate to the Foundation, please make checks payable to The Montel Williams MS Foundation, 331 West 57 Street, PMB #420, New York, NY 10019, or call (212) 830-0348 to make credit card donations. To make your donation online, visit the Foundation's website (or here!!).
