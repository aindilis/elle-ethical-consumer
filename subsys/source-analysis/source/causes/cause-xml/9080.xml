  <description>Virunga is truly the crown jewel of Africa&#8217;s national parks. The park contains over 50% of sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s biodiversity and is home to about 200 of the earth&#8217;s last 720 critically endangered mountain gorillas. Virunga is also the second oldest national park in the world, behind only Yellowstone. Despite this, the forests and amazing animals of the park, most notably the mountain gorilla, are in a desperate fight for their survival.

1. Maintain around the clock protection of mountain gorillas

2. Support Virunga Park Rangers and their families

3. Funds needed for the runnings costs of Virunga National Park</description>
