  <description>The Pro-life cause asserts that all humans are persons from conception to natural death, and that abortion, euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, and any other action that takes away human lives and dignity is intriniscally wrong and inexcusable.

If you are planning to attend either the March for Life in Washington, DC or the Walk for Life in San Francisco next week, be sure to join Father Pavone, Alveda King, Janet Morana &amp; Dr. Theresa Burke at the events listed at www.priestsforlife.org/marchforlife

An integral part of both events is the Silent No More Awareness Campaign gatherings, where post-abortive men &amp; women will share their testimonies. Please make plans to join us for these gatherings to hear their testimonies in person! Anyone who regrets their abortion or lost fatherhood and would like to give a testimony or hold a sign at these events should sign up at www.silentnomoreawareness.org

1. Induced abortion is intrinsically wrong, with no exceptions.

2. Physician assisted (active) euthanasia is always wrong and contrary to human dignity.

3. Embryonic stem cell research that uses stem cells from aborted embryos is immoral.

4. Capital punishment is wrong unless it is directly necessary to ensure the safety of society.</description>
