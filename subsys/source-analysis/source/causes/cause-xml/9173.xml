  <description>This is to help out brothers and sisters effected by flood Almost 300 people have died and 200 are still reported missing after heavy rain in Balochistan and Sindh provinces. 

There are warnings that the situation could deteriorate, and the agencies say the money would be used to provide temporary shelter. 

The flooding began with a cyclone in June, causing rivers to burst their banks and shortages of clean water. 

More than two million people are thought to have been affected, with hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes. 

In June relief officials in Balochistan said the situation was being brought under control, but many flood victims complained of receiving little or no help.
