  <description>Universal Healthcare. Some claim that it slows treatment and that it could never work in a country of our size. Yet, if properly funded, Universal Healthcare could eliminate many of the complications that the current system presents. A person should never be unable to get access to treatment because they lack the proper insurance or any insurance, or because they are unable to pay for treatment. With the current system of numerous private health insurance groups, there is no way to truly guarantee that all people will receive the treatment they need or will be insured. Only with a centralized government program can we truly guarantee that everyone has a chance at a healthy life, or at least one where they have options when things go wrong. 

1. That all Americans deserve access to medical treatment, regardless of their economic standing or insurance policy. 

2. That America is capable of and should form a centralized, public universal healthcare program. </description>
