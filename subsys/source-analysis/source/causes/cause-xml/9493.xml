Since starting the breast cancer movement 25 years ago, Susan G. Komen for the Cure has transformed the clinic and the culture &#8212; how the world talks about and treats this devastating disease &#8212; and helped turn millions of breast cancer patients into survivors. In that time, Komen will have invested nearly $1 billion into breast cancer research and community outreach programs, becoming the largest source of non-profit funds fighting the disease.

We've come a long way, but the fight isn&#8217;t over yet. Our mission won&#8217;t be complete until we end breast cancer forever. So, in the next decade, Komen is committing another $1 billion to that end.

1. The Promise: to save lives and end breast cancer forever by empowering people, ensuring quality care for all and energizing science to find the cures.

2. The Vision: A world without breast cancer.</description>
