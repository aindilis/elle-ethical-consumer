  <description>Infertility is a medical condition that affects approximately 10% of the population, people of all races and classes. Chances are you know at least one person who is infertile, though they may not have told anyone. Infertility is defined as "the inability to achieve a successful pregnancy after one year of unprotected intercourse." The effects of infertility is so much more.

It can be emotionally devastating to learn that you will need medical treatment to get or stay pregnant, or to hear that you may never have your own biological children. There are many paths to parenthood, some involving medications, some donor eggs or donor sperm, some a surrogate, and for some adoption. Every path has its own challenges and emotional toll. Studies have shown that depression caused by infertility is comparable to that caused by cancer.

Many treatments for infertility involve hormone treatments, daily injections, even surgeries. It is a long process that doesn't always work. Some are lucky enough to be able to afford the treatments that have been developed to allow them a chance to become parents, but for many such treatments are financially out of reach. With the exception of a handful of states, most of the US and Canada has no insurance coverage for infertility treatment.
