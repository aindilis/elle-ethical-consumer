Each year, 800,000 women and children are kidnapped and sold into sex slavery- rape for pay. As young as 5, they will be raped until they die. This group and the I AM COMING Campaign is dedicated to raising awareness of the crisis of human trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation...and eventually see it eradicated. Be sure to invite all your friends and add your voice at www.IAMCOMING.org.


If you want to make donations, please send them to Jay Brock, the original creator of the I AM COMING group. You can mail a cheque or cash to I AM COMING P.O Box 73007 Hamilton L9A 5H7, Ontario, Canada. Thank you for all your support. The money will go to helping the group get a charity status. Once it has that, it can really start to help people.

Or you can make donations to the beneficiary I selected that deals in this area and who could use all the donations we can give them. 



1. No one deserves to be kidnapped and put into a position of both phyiscal and emotional harm.

2. Everyone deserves to be found and brought home before they die.

3. To prevent the abuse, rape, and deaths of thousands of people who are forced into this lifestyle.</description>
