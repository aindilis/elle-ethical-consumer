  <description>Video games are in danger of being severely restricted and, perhaps, banned by several government officials who oppose them. We deserve to keep the right to play video games even though the government does not favor them. That is the goal of this cause.

1. Gamers must actively oppose officials such as the Senators John McCain and Joe Leiberman if we are to have freedom of playing video games.

2. Individuals' compatibility with video games should be judged on an individual basis instead of creating a broad stereotype that a certain game is or is not appropriate for a certain age group.

3. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) should be governed more by the public opinion than by their tendency to obscenely exaggerate the sins of video games.</description>
