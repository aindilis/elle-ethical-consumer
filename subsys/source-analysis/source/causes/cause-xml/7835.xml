  <description>The Esprit Foundation maintains vendor agreements with quality programs that offer various sports or artistic activities in which the children have indicated an interest.  The Foundation pays the fees required directly to these vendors for the children&#8217;s participation in their programs.  Esprit Foundation may also elect to pay expenses in addition to the enrollment fees, if appropriate.  Candidates&#8217; parents/guardians must complete an application for each child.  Enrollment and selection are based upon need and availability.  The Foundation has adopted an anti-discrimination policy which is strictly enforced.  Esprit Foundation may elect to secure additional programs outside its vendor relationships if a child indicates an interest which cannot be fulfilled by any of the existing programs offered by the Foundation.

1. All children deserve to experience the warmth of belonging, the fun of learning, the fulfillment of accomplishing and the impact of excelling by means of quality programs in athletics and the arts.

2. Opportunities should be available to all children where they can have fun and to grow personally.

3. Children will benefit from positive learning and interactions that keep them away from less desirable activites such as boredom, inactivity, drugs and violence.</description>
