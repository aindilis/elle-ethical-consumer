  <description>Over 500,000 people sustain brain and spinal cord injuries in the United States each year. The most frequent causes are motor vehicle crashes, falls, sports and recreation and violence. Children and teens are at high-rish for these devastating injuries, most of which are preventable. ThinkFirst targets this high-risk age group with compelling programs using PowerPoint, videos and speakers. These programs educate young people about personal vulnerability and risk taking. ThinkFirst's success lies in the individuals known as Voices for Injury Prevention (VIPs), those who have themselves sustained a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury. They share their testimony with students and community members to encourage practicing safety habits that can prevent a life changing injury. The message is to "ThinkFirst" and have a fun-filled life while "using your mind to protect your body."
