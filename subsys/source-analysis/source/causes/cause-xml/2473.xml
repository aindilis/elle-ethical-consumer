  <description>June 18th/2007 I found out that Mila passed away because of her brain tumor!, having to watch the pain this little girl went through just from her pictures and videos makes me want more then ever to help find a cure for that evil beast.

I started this cause due to a little girl named Mila Phillips. she is 2 years old and will have to leave this world because of an inoperable brain tumor, her mom is a single parent and has had to quit her job to be with her daughter till the very end, with little or no financial support at all other then the support of all those who have never met her and care so much to help with donations, and because of all those generous people she has been able to stay caught up on her bill's and been able to stay home with her babygirl.

Mila was diagnosed with a Terminal Brainstem Glioma Astrocytoma Tumor on September 6th/2007 at Phoenix Children's Hospital. It is inoperable, and because of her age untreatable or treatable with risks to high to take. she was only given 6 months at the most to live by hospice and Doctor's and has made it 2 months past her given time.  Please help me in my mission to help raise money for brain tumor research. I promise you won't regret it.

and please check out the websites below for more info about Mila, the cafepress one is a shop I made with products all with picture of her, that is to raise money for her.  I have already sent her mom the first check with over 300 dollars from commission sales!.
