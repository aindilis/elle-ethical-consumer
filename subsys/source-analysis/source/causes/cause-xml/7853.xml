  <description>A vehicle running on LPG emits 20 % less carbon thn a car running on petrol..... so therefore globalwarming could be delayed;so tht we get time to introduce some renewable source of energy as our main fuel



Liquefied petroleum gas (also called liquified petroleum gas, liquid petroleum gas, LPG, LP Gas, or autogas) is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases used as a fuel in heating appliances and vehicles, and increasingly replacing chlorofluorocarbons as an aerosol propellant and a refrigerant to reduce damage to the ozone layer.  

 LPG is manufactured during the refining of crude oil, or extracted from oil or gas streams as they emerge from the ground.

Autogas is widely used as a "green" fuel as it decreases exhaust emissions (less 20% CO2) . It has an octane rating (MON/RON) that is between 90 and 110 and an energy content (higher heating value&#8212;HHV) that is between 25.5 megajoules per litre (for pure propane) and 28.7 megajoules per litre (for pure butane.)

1. Keep the planet green ,reduce the carbon emission</description>
