  <description>For decades, Israel has been the witness of the on-going conflict between its people-the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Israelis believe they are the rightful people of the region and that it belongs to the Jewish, while the Palestinians believe it belongs to them and the Islamic religion. They are consistently fighting/bombing each other in hopes of taking control of the country; yet only hurting thousands of innocent civilians and leaving a sacred piece of history in endless destruction. 

Help bring peace between them and support the belief that they can live in peace.

1. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be stopped.

2. Peace should be the only answer, not a civil war</description>
