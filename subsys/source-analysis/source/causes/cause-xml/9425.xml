  <description>Hunting Park Christian Academy is an urban, inner city school reaching out to at-risk youth (in grades Pre-K to 8th) in Philadelphia.  Our intent is to raise up young men and women who will not be swayed by every passing thought or temptation in their environment but rather who impact their environment (and the people therein) by standing firm on the promises of God in His Word.  The very promises that Jesus, the ultimate Wind Changer, declared.  We teach our children that God has a very powerful and very specific plan for their lives: "For I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm.  Plans to give you hope and a future."  Jeremiah 29:11  Would you join us in raising up such young "Wind Changers" in the Hunting Park area of Philadelphia?
