  <description>Brachial Plexus is an injury that only a handful of people in the US suffer from. No one is aware of it, and there is little to no recovery from it. For those of you who do not know what it is , it is when your shoulder seperates causing the nerves in your arm to either break apart or stretch, leaving your arm completely paralyzed. 

I got a BP injury last August when I was ejected from a flipping car. Unfortunately BP injuries can happen at birth, and most sufferers aren't as lucky as I.

1. Fight it.

2. Tell others about it.

3. Cure it.</description>
