  <description>In the US, we waste billions of pounds of food annually.  This food can be used for more than just feeding people, it can serve as a tool to teach job skills.  The very industries that create the food surplus also have rapid job growth.  

DC Central Kitchen trains unemployed men and women for careers in the culinary industry, giving them the opportunity to succeed.  

Thousands of meals a day are produced by the students and delivered to other local service agencies allowing them to focus more resources on their core missions.

1. Waste is wrong; be it food, money or people.

2. Every community has the tools needed for permanent change, if  we use them more effectively.

3. Stereotypes of hunger and homelessness hold us back.  We need to confront them.</description>
