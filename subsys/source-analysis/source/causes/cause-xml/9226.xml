  <description>The answer to overpriced college bookstores.

 halfcollegebooks.com

College textbooks aren't getting cheaper! We the students have to pay absurd amounts of money for college books at the bookstore.  Today that ends, 
 halfcollegebooks.com, founded by college students to save all of us money.  Often times our new textbooks are cheaper than the used books from our campus bookstores.

halfcollegebook.com saves us money on all new textbooks we have to buy.

So if you are buying new, buy from halfcollegebooks.com.

Later this fall, halfcollegebook.com will hopefully be in the used book business, saving college students even
more.

No more bookstore!  halfcollegebook.com

They save you money on every purchase!
