  <description>In 1973, the US Supreme Court confirmed one of  our nation's darkest and most harmful secrets by declaring:

"Education, of course, is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution. Nor do we find any basis for saying it is implicitly so protected."

The result has been an American education system that: 
- Leaves millions of children without the skills they need to succeed (two thirds of American youth cannot read at grade level proficiency and more than a million drop out of high school each year)
- Lags behind international counterparts (the US education system ranked just 18th out of 24 countries according to UNICEF in 2003), and
- Is woefully unequitable (a child born into the poorest fifth of families is seven times less likely to have the chance to go to college than a child born into the richest fifth of families).

A national movement of students from all across the country is standing up to fight these problems by pushing for an American right to high quality education.  Already more than 13,000 students have signed a petition to be delivered to our nation's leaders in Washington, DC.  If you agree with this cause, please add your voice to this movement and
