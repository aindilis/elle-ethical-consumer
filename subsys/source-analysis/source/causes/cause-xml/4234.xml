  <description>The MEEF English Medium School is the centre point of three adjoining villages in the rural area of Narsapur, India.

The capacity of the school is presently 450, half of which are girls.

Founded in January 1992 by a diehard visionary called Jyothi Reddy, MEEF is a fitting solution to most of the problems afflicting this region - illiteracy, lack of basic infrastructure, unemployment, ignorance, region feuds and threats that are an inherent part of the Telangana history. Through the foundation the local people of Narsapur and the surrounding villages have conceived a sound longterm plan for their own community welfare and happiness.

MEEF aims to change the perspective of the people -from fear to freedom, from dependence to independence and from local to global. The goal is to transform the village and the surrounding region through the awareness of their own strengths and collective self help, to instill faith and confidence in themselves to change their environment bearing in mind the overall socioeconomic, cultural and spiritual needs.
