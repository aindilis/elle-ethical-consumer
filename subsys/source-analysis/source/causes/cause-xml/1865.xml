  <description>Rape is Never Justified&#8482; is a movement built to help, both, victims and survivors of sexual abuse and rape to find their voice and speak out. I think the most unique thing about RNJ is that, as a staff, we don't encourage you to report your act of violence, we don't encourage you to talk with anyone-professionals included, and we don't encourage you to turn to a Higher Power/religion to become a survivor. We only encourage you to fight when you're ready and willing- and we want to be here along the way.
