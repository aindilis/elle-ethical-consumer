  <description>Started by ISB students nearly four years ago, HFH is the fastest growing and the largest organization of its kind in the International School of Beijing with over 50 members. Our fundraising committee has raised a total of 30,000 RMB just over the past year from donations and activities. We also host up to three building trips a year for ISB students to participate in. He/She is given the great chance of travelling to rural China to assist with the actual building of our projects and experience it first-hand. Our extensive resources allow us to be present at almost all community activities involving ISB including rugby games, school plays and musicals, and of course the Spring Fair. Please do not hesistate to approach our booth to make a donation or purchase some of our exclusive items: T-shirts, postcards, and wristbands.
