  <description>It's not at all fair how:
-people abuse and misuse dogs because they are stronger and they can gamble on them
-people are trying to outlaw a kind of dog
-dogs are being abandoned because of irresponsible owners
-dogs are treated, legally and emotionally, like property 
-people think it's okay to gamble with a life of an animal with personality and feelings

1. animal abuse has to stop. NOW. 

2. stop abandonedment of puppies and other poor creatures

3. don't outlaw pittbulls and bulldogs because they are strong, outlaw the people that are cruel and using a defenseless animal for gambling </description>
  <mission>to show people that you can't outlaw a breed. It's like outlawing a race</mission>
  <name>It's not the Pitbull's fault!</name>
