  <description>Aid for Africa is a club created in Northwood High School. This club chooses an organization each year to donate to. Last year, we donated $1,200 to Heifer Organization and this year we hope to donate even more to the Clinton Foundation. This foundation builds clinics all around Africa to help those who are HIV positive. If one is HIV positive, they will give you medicine for free. Reducing the price of medicines is a key component to reaching their goal of making high-quality treatment equally available to people in need across the developing world. Aid for Africa hopes to raise awareness to the poverty and diseases going on in different places in Africa.
