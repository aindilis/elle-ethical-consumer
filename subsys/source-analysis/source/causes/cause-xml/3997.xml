  <description>When someone cuts down a tree, they are supposed to plant another one. Well, we all know that they aren't replanting the rain forest. Also, it's not that hard for people to throw trash in a trash can, and yet it still ends up all over the ground. All we are asking s to take better care of the earth. Turn your lights and water off when you aren't using them, carpool, wash your car less, don't drive unless you absolutely need to. It's the small things that matter! Try to make this world a better place to live in!

1. Do as many things you can to help!!!

2. There's too much urbanization!

3. Too many trees are being cut down and not being replanted!</description>
