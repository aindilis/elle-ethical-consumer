  <description>Right now in Uganda, Africa, there are millions of children dying of hunger, poverty, and war each day.  Children as young as five and many of them orphaned by Africa's AIDS scourge, are in constant danger of being abducted by the mysterious rebel group Lord's Resistance Army, to fight in a twenty-year-old civil war.  Rebel leader, Joseph Kony, wished to rule Uganda, abducting and killing thousands of children and displacing nearly two million people. Fear has overcome these children, forcing them to run from their homes and sleep in abandoned buildings, therefore becoming &#8220;invisible&#8221;.  A truce was signed in August, but the survivors still need to rebuild their community and pay for their necessities, and that is where our club comes in.
