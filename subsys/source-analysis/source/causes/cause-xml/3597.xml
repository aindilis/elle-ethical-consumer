  <description>Established in 1994 by M&#183;A&#183;C Cosmetics, the M&#183;A&#183;C AIDS Fund supports men, women and children affected by HIV/AIDS globally. Introducing its first VIVA GLAM lipstick that same year, M&#183;A&#183;C decided that every cent of the selling price of the VIVA GLAM lipsticks would go to the M&#183;A&#183;C AIDS Fund. With a total of four VIVA GLAM lipsticks now sold worldwide, and through the annual Kids Helping Kids Card Program, M&#183;A&#183;C Cosmetics has provided over $150 million (US) to date for the M&#183;A&#183;C AIDS Fund. The M&#183;A&#183;C AIDS Fund is the heart and soul of the company &#8211; with its employees giving their time, energy and talent to help those affected by HIV/AIDS worldwide.
