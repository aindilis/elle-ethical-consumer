  <description>"The Earth's forests are in crisis. We've already lost 80 percent of Old Growth forests worldwide, a figure that increases to 95 percent in the United States. According to the United Nations, at least 37.5 million acres of rainforests are lost annually -- an area the size of Georgia. Despite the relatively small land area they cover, rainforests are home to about half of the planet&#8217;s 5 to 10 million plant and animal species." ~Rainforest Action Network

These forests need our help.  We CAN stop the destruction of nature's most valuable resources.  There are thousands, maybe millions of plants to be discovered in these forests that some sources say may help create a cure of cancer and other outstanding diseases.  These rainforests are home to thousands of animals and insects, and their habitats are being destroyed right and left.  It's time we step up and do something. 

1. Protect the rainforests and the rights of their inhabitants.</description>
