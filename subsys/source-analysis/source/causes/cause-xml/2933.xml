  <description>Egypt is overflowing with corruption, whether it is political, economic, or social. Egypt as a whole is corrupted, however, the source of this corruption comes straight from the three governmental institutes; Executive (i.e.; government and police), Parliament, and the Judiciary. 

For the sake of a better Egypt, and for the sake of future generations, this corruption has to end to achieve full economic prosperity, human rights, equality and democracy among all socio-economic classes in Egypt.

1. End to Political Corruption, Persecution and injustice

2. End to Economic Corruption, "Wasta", rising prices, and Monopolies (Ahmed Ezz and Steal)

3. End to Human Rights Violations, Police Brutality, and Police Torture</description>
