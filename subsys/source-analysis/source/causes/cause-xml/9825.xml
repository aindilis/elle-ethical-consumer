  <description>In our every day life, throughout society, we frequently encounter individuals of questionable intelligence that lack the ability of acting rationally. We are constantly disappointed that these people, mostly women, cannot defend or explain the motives of what they've done. Among these actions are: adultery, pointless lies, deceptiveness, indifference to human emotions, inability to tell the truth, incompetence and incapable of appropriateness in social interaction.

We feel that failure to verbally or emotionally repent these wrongdoings constitutes a mild and sometimes severe form of social retardation.

We want to understand, we need to understand&#8230; it is imperative that we understand!

Please help us understand!
