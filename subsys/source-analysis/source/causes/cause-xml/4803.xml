  <description>we all do it,at one stage or another,judge people,tease people,but how would it feel to look across at someone you dont usually interact with,and say,"i feel you?,its based on an oprah show that inspired me to do this,and to say,its ok to be who you are. Also to think about people you may have hurt,and apologise,whether its privately or to them...so please,think about what ive said,and very importantly how you feel about the subject.I hope,that if nothing else,this makes you think,about your actions toward others...races religions societal status,hair colour,we all have the same heart,that beats the same,in all of us...Remember,a little compassion and understanding,can go a very long way to those on the recieving end...im not trying to do some peace and free love thing here,just stand up,for what i believe, and I hope you do too,no one can be perfect all of the time,and occasional judgement is inevitable,but as best we can,i believe we should try to understand rather than judge

1. racism of any kind is not acceptable

2. it is far easier to simply judge a person,then to try and understand their situation

3. compassion,will get us a lot further than any kind of anymosity</description>
