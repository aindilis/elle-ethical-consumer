  <description>The Newport administration is the biggest group of dipshits ever...they have destroyed the Newport spirit...suspended random people unreasonably or even worse, without reason...put up stupid rules...got rid of senior walls and senior wills...why won't they understand high school culture when they are the administrators for a high school...someone has to tell them what high school culture is like and get Newport spirit back...and that is our job as students of Newport High School

...support the Knights but fuck the administration

1. Newport spirit

2. A wish to get Newport back to its old self

3. Hate for what the Newport administration is doing

4. Hate for what Newport has become because of the administration</description>
