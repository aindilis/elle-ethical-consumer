  <description>"It's up to us to make a difference. It's up to us to care." &#169;

This message from David Saltzman's book "The Jester Has Lost His Jingle" spells out the underlying philosophy of The Jester &amp; Pharley Phund, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation with a vital and powerful educational mission, which has its genesis in David's book.

Dying of Hodgkin's disease at the age of 22, David had a key wish: To get his message of hope, love, laughter and charity to children around the world who needed to find their smiles.

It didn't matter to David what challenged these children - a life-threatening disease, a chronic illness, an environment of hopelessness, a seemingly insurmountable obstacle, an abusive situation, lack of skills to read and write, or even just a bad day at school.

David wanted to reach out to these youngsters to offer them personal encouragement. He wanted them to know that no obstacle is too difficult to overcome and how important it is to never give up.



1. Spread the message of hope, love, laughter and charity to children around the world who needed to find their smiles.

2. Donate books to ill and special-needs children &amp; literacy programs.

3. To fund research for Hodgkin's Disease.</description>
