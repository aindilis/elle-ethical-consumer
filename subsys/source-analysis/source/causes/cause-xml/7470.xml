  <description>Why are we flying halfway around the world to help total strangers in a foreign nation when there are people just down the street who need just as much help finding food, shelter, and a decent job? People need to help their friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens  before looking thousands of miles away for someone to help. You want to help starving kids.. there are plenty right here. 12% of Americans do not have sufficient food to eat on a daily basis. If you want to help give shelter to others, there are 3.5 million homeless in the U.S. 35 million live in poverty. In addition, 30% of all Americans live on the edge of poverty and the percentage of Americans below the line has grown in recent years.
