  <description>For over 60 years, the Palestinians have lived under a brutal Israeli occupation, The world has stood by and done nothing, all while Israel kills innocent people everyday, disrupt the lives of millions of Palestinians with checkpoints, house demolitions, illegal imprisonments and cold blooded murder.

The People of Palestine have been fighting an advanced military equipped with the latest weaponry and war planes with nothing more than rocks, home made rockets and rusty AK-47's. 
A justified fight to gain their independence, a fight that is allowed by international law and U.N resolutions.

The State of Israel has been in defiance of International Law for too long, they are even building a separation and racist wall that is stealing more land, and disrupting the lives of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.

All while the world watches, and all while the Palestinians are labeled as terrorists for doing what is in their right to do, which is resist occupation.

The History of the land clearly stands on the side of the Palestinians, they are the rightful owners of the land, and they have compromised a lot so far.
Ending the Occupation is the only solution to this problem that has shaped the Middle East for the Past half a Century. 

This Illegal occupation must end.

1. End the Occupation 

2. Raise awarness of the illegal tactics of the IDF
