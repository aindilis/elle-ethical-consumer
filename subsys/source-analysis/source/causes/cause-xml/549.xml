  <description>This year's Spotlight Campaign focuses on the women of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. "Stop Raping our Greatest Resource: Power to Women in the DRC" is a new global campaign to call attention to the wide-scale atrocities committed against women and girls in Eastern DRC and demand an end to the impunity with which these crimes are committed.

V-Day has developed a PowerPoint that you can use to conduct a teach-in at your school, workplace or in your home.  We urge you to take advantage of this opportunity to educate yourself and members of your community about conflict in the DRC. 

Visit http://newsite.vday.org/congo-teach-in to sign-up to host a teach-in and check out the new facebook page, "Congo Teach-In: Educate and Activate" for more information.
