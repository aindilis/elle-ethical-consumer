  <description>Hello! I'm Vikki, founder of the 'For the love of Andrew Lloyd Webber' cause. I am a huge fan of him and his works. You might not have heard of him, but it's more than likely you've heard of some of his works. A few of his best known are: Cats, Joseph and the Technicolor Dream Coat, Starlight Express and The Phantom of the Opera. You can check out his website at www.andrewlloydwebber.com and don't forget to sign up for the e-newsletter!
