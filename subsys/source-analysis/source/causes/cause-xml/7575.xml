  <description>lots of people LOVE animals, some people have animals as pets and could not bare to loose them, well unfortunatly, there are animals out there that dont have a home and have to go through the pain and suffering from animal testing. I am an animal lover and I can't STAND animals getting hurt, and they can't do anything about it... so we need to be there voices, we need to help these animals !

1. Animal Testing is not required by law !!!

2. WE NEED TO STOP ANIMALS FROM BEING USED LIKE THIS !!

3. Animals deserve the same rights as humans</description>
