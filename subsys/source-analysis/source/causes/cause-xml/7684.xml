  <description>In 1942 David Ben-Gurion established the Committee for the Welfare of Soldiers, whose first order of business was rounding up donations of blankets for the young Jewish men and women of the Yishuv's fledging Jewish Brigade.

Now named the Association for the Wellbeing of Israel's Soldiers (AWIS), this independent, non-profit organization has come a long way and has made major contributions to the State of Israel. 

Neither the government, the Israel Defense Forces, nor any other body subsidizes the Association. 

The Friends of the Israel Defense Forces (FIDF) is the American partner of the AWIS. FIDF helps support social, educational and recreational programs and facilities for the young men and women soldiers of Israel who defend the Jewish homeland. We also provide these services to the widows and children of soldiers who have fallen in defense of Israel . FIDF is a tax-deductible organization by US law. 

Today's support includes; building, maintaining and operating 17 modern and sophisticated facilities; establishing and renovating hundreds Isconstant caring for each and every IDF soldier. 

All this has been achieved thanks only to the assiduous endeavors of the FIDF, its friends and dedicated supporters.
