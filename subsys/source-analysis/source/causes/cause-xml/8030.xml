  <description>Please join my club. I am so sick of seeing and hearing Paris Hilton's name.  She is not a celebrity and does nothing but make a scene.  Please stop giving her fame when none is deserved.  As for Julia Stiles....She just irritates the hell out of me and I don't think I am alone...Otherwise we would have seen her in more and better movies. Although her protrayal in "The Omen", namely her death...was spectacular. Make no mistake I wish her no harm.There is no charge and we will never ask for donations. 

1. Julia Stiles is irritating!!!!!

2. Paris Hilton is NOT a celebrity!!!!

3. Paris Hilton and Julia Stiles should be ignored and removed from all media.</description>
