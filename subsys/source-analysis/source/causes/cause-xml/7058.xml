  <description>To provide safe and happy environments  for Garden Gnomes everywhere. To provide them with trees and shrubs for privacy, to allow them access to flowers and bushes that are attractive to them. To ensure they are not sprayed with pesticides, and to provide them with umbrellas  to prevent  them from drowning when dogs and other animals  pee on them.
We can do this people, if we only try!



1. Garden Gnomes are brutally abused by rabbits, we must stop the raping of Garden Gnomes by rabbits!

2. Every Garden Gnome must have an umbrella.

3. To let the world know that Garden Gnomes are not cruel or vicious, they are just misunderstood</description>
