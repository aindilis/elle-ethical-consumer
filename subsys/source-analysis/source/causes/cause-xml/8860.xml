  <description>On the morning of December 26, 2004, an earthquake tore apart the ocean floor off the coast of northwest Sumatra.  The earthquake was the second largest of its kind and unleashed a ravaging tsunami that took the lives of over 200,000 people across southern Asia.  The devastation displaced thousands and left many without parents, siblings, and other relatives.

The city of Galle, located on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, was one of the hardest hit cities.  The objective of the Tsunami Victims Ohio Project is to provide for the long-term educational (until the end of secondary and possible tertiary education) welfare of twelve young students affected by the tsunami of 2004.  The scope of the proposed project is to develop a program to rehabilitate and develop long-term educational care plans for the twelve students of Sudharma Elementary/Secondary School, Galle.

Funds for the project were raised during early to mid 2005.  So far nearly $13,000 has been collected.  Donations were made by LAcNet, Battelle employees, Hilliard Darby High School Student Senate, and other concerned individuals.  In addition, some school supplies were donated by the students of Hilliard Heritage Middle School.
