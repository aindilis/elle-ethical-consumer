  <description>The Shelter Association of Washenaw County's mission is to provide temporary shelter and supportive services in a safe and caring environment and to work with the community to allocate the necessary resources to meet the needs of individual adults who are homeless.


The Shelter Association serves the largest percentage of those experiencing homelessness in Washtenaw County: single adult men and women.  All of our clients share two characteristics: they have no place to live, and they do not currently have the resources to secure and maintain housing.  Many of our clients are unable to obtain housing on their own, because they are facing multiple barriers that impede their ability to do so. 

We offer a variety of services and programs to help individuals who are experiencing homelessness.  Services range from providing emergency shelter, referrals for substance abuse treatment, clothing vouchers, transportation, and food to providing health care, housing assistance, and money management. 

1. Homelessness, it can happen to anyone.

2. Ending homelessness one person at a time.</description>
