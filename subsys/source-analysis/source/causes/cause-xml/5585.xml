  <description>I would just like to say that; there is so much negitivity going on in this world and it needs to stop. Stop taking yourself so seriously and laugh. When someone makes a joke about your beliefs, LAUGH. Then, maybe, we can change evrything else. 
The world isn't as bad as it seems. We just need to unite and stand together and we will be fine.


Hey, cheer up! You're loved!
We are the future, not the past. We can change.


Charles Swindoll once said, "We connot change our past. We cannot change the fact that people will act a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play the one string we have and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it."
