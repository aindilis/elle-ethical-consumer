  <description>the war in Iraq has gone on too long and must be stopped, this is to show the government that this war is not supported by over half the nation and must be ended.

1. this is not America's war... It is Bush's war

2. This war is not for terrorism, it is for oil

3. this war is unwinnable

4. if nothing is done soon this war will become a repeat of the vietnam war</description>
