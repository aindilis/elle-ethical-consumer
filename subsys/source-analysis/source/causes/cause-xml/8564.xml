Any horse taken under the society's stewardship, is 
given a permanent home among the  gently rolling hills 
of the facility's 120 acres pasture. 

The Friesian Rescue Society is a 501(c)3 non -profit 
organization(status pending).
All positions are volunteer and an endowment is being set in place 
for the perpetual care of Friesian horses that are in need of 
sponsorship.  If you wish to sponsor a Friesian or wish to provide 
funds to insure the success of the organization, please contact the
