  <description>My Mother Sheila Rennie, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1999 and underwent treatment and was given a clean bill of health after treatment.  In 2003 she relapsed and the cancer was too far gone, had spread to her liver and head and she survived only four months, passing on May 25, 2004.  She would be honored with anyone who supports the missions we've listed here and would be very proud of us! Mom I miss u soooo much, and i love you
