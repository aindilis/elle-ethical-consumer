  <description>The Light The Night Walk is The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's nationwide evening walk. Walkers carry illuminated balloons to celebrate and commemorate the lives touched by cancer. Funds raised will support our mission to cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, and to improve the quality of life of patients and their families.

Tamara is fundraising in memory of her father, Ken Glickman, who succumbed to Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma after a two-year battle.  He was given a prognosis of ten years.

Your participation saves lives.  Please donate.


1. Every five minutes someone is diagnosed with blood cancer. Every ten minutes, someone dies. 

2. Leukemia causes more deaths among children than any other cancer.

3. More than 20,000 Americans died from lymphoma in 2006.

4. I'm not sure where the link provided by Facebook goes, should you decide to make a donation.

5. So, please donate at my fundraising page:
