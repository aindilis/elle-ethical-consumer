  <description>Acting on AIDS is a movement started by Christian college students to create awareness and promote activism of the global AIDS pandemic at colleges and universities across the nation. 

Motivated by our faith in Jesus, we are raising resources for communities most affected by the global AIDS pandemic through World Vision's HIV and AIDS Hope Initiative.

Your support will help care for orphans and other children, equip volunteer caregivers for orphan families, offer HIV-prevention and abstinence training for youth, train community leaders and prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

1. The global AIDS pandemic is the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time.

2. Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress (James 1:27)

3. Just one dollar a day can make a real and lasting difference for children and families affected by HIV and AIDS.</description>
