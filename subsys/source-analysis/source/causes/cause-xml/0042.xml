  <description>Have you ever seen the look on a person's face at the moment of self-discovery, when they experience the power of information at their own fingertips? With the click of a mouse, a person can find a job, get help with homework or learn about how to manage their health. Imagine if every person who wanted that experience could have it, what would our country look like? Indeed, what would the world look like? 

That is exactly what One Economy set out to do with a bold strategy of bringing broadband access, technology skills and online educational resources into the homes of low-income people.

Unfortunately, we still live in a world where too many people are locked out of the economic mainstream. The good news is that technology, and the Internet in particular, gives us an unprecedented means to open the doors of opportunity for those who need and want it most. With the smart and focused use of technology, we can change the way we think about and fight poverty.

Your support will enable us to put these tools into the hands of the people that need them most.
