  <description>Soccer was intended to be referred to as football. To those who don't know the history, here's a lesson: In the beginning there was football, actually as early as 217 A.D. In 1823, however, Rugby was invented. It was to be based on the rules of football except altered to involve usage of the hands, which of course is not allowed in football. Rugby though, was also at this time still referred to as football. This caused some to rename football as "association football" which was shortened to "assoc" and is where the term "soccer" originated, but eventually, the term football was to be used strictly for football and rugby was renamed as such. 

The same should happen today; American football should be renamed just as rugby was. Football in America deserves to be called by the correct name, otherwise it shall never become as popular as in the rest of the world, and the sport in America shall never gain the respect it deserves from the rest of the world either.

p.s. Don't bother donating. You can if you want, it just goes to the U.S. Soccer Foundation... It's not going to ACTUALLY help the cause though.

1. Refer to "soccer" as football.

2. Refer to American football as "American football" until a better substitute has been suggested.

3. Spread the word of the cause to those you know in hopes of it reaching the masses.</description>
