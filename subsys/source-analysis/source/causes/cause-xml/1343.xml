  <description>The Chicago Anti-Hunger Federation serves an average of 150,000 hungry people each month through a regional network of 160 soup kitchens, food pantries, shelters, daycare and adult care facilities.  Through our efforts, many children, seniors and other family members are able to eat 3.6 million meals each year.
Our programs include Healthy Food Distribution; Oliver's Kitchen; Westside Providers Network; and Project "Newtrition."
In 2008, the Chicago Anti-Hunger Federation made the decision to accept, purchase, and distribute only healthy, nutritional food throughout the organization&#8217;s emergency food distribution process. In doing so, the Chicago Anti-Hunger Federation has set a new direction for the organization and for the future of emergency food distribution. Additionally, the Chicago Anti-Hunger Federation will not accept or distribute any food that has been deemed unfit for sale. You would not serve a child a bruised peach and neither would we.
Our work is done with the simple belief: dignity served daily.


1. Dignity should not be sacrificed when receiving food from assistance programs

2. Health and nutrition must be considered when ending hunger

3. Managing hunger is not the same as Ending  hunger.</description>
