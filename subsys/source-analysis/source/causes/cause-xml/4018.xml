  <description>From June 15 to June 30, Revolution Health is sponsoring an online health fair.  You can visit it by going to www.revolutionhealth.com/healthfair.  At the health fair, you can learn about your risk from 10 common health conditions, and learn more about the work that groups combatting these conditions have underway.  And, Revolution Health makes a donation to each group when you visit their "booth" at the online health fair.  All you have to do is show up and look around!

1. Everyone should know about their health risks

2. Everyone should support groups working to reduce health risks</description>
