  <description>Every Tuesday in the month of June, we give 60 elementary kids 2 hours of sports, fun, and teamwork and leadership buildling.  We're partnered with ASPIRE a program run at Anderson Mill Elementary.  We go from 9 am to 11 am so its pretty much perfect: you get to relive your childhood days of recess for two hours AND its not like you're missing out on anything else because nobody is up yet.    

WE NEED VOLUNTEERS!

please message me, wall me, or call me (565.8779) to sign up.

ps - we want time and love, not money.



FOR THE VOLUNTEERS:

1. You can really learn things from running around and playing.

2. It's not all about academics.

3. Every kid deserves a fun summer.</description>
