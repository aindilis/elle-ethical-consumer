  <description>The Unicorn population is dwindling. Our support group will focus on legislation to place the Unicorn on the Endangered Species Act and to form worldwide, regional groups to promulgate the mission. In addition, the regional groups will focus on expanding membership and support of our cause.

1. The decline of the Unicorn population must end.

2. The rights of Unicorns must be acknowledged and upheld.

3. The Unicorn is a sentient life-form and has every right to exist in peace with other life forms.</description>
