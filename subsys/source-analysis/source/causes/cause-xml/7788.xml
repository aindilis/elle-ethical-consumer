  <description>With the genocide raging on in Darfur, eventually, there will be no one left. Thus, we are presented with 196,555 square miles of unused land.

And that's where the paving comes in.

With your help, we're going to turn Darfur into a gigantic paid parking lot.

1. Speculate on the future use of Darfur

2. Build a gigantic parking lot on what was once Darfur

3. Donate 1% of the revenue from the parking lot to charitable causes</description>
