  <description>VOCAL was founded in 2007 to break down walls of cruelty and build monuments of compassion and knowledge. With our three core values of communication, education, and stimulation, VOCAL works towards its goal of aiding animals all over the world through creative outreach projects and with educational materials.

1. Animals are not lower-class citizens.

2. Animals deserve respect and should not be abused.

3. Animals should not be worn as fur.

4. Animals should not be eaten as food.

5. Animal testing is inhumane and too inaccurate to be used. </description>
