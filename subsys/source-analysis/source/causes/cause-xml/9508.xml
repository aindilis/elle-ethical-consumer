  <description>Increasing your car's horsepower doesn't mean you intend to street race. There are many vehicles that come with upwards of 600hp from the factory, capable of running near 10 second 1/4 mile passes. Targeting modified car owners is simply cracking down on the poor, since the rich can still buy a 911 Turbo, Corvette Z06, etc..
Street racing is also not limited to owners of modified vehicles. If you read the paper, the majority of street racing accidents involve higher end luxury sedans and SUVs. It's interesting how the Att.Gen. Michael Bryant keeps blaming modified car owners, but does not bother to back it up with statistics.
Finally, street racing itself is a ploy by lazy politicians to allow them an easy platform to run their campaign on, rather than having to tackle issues that matter like education, healthcare and the lack of funding that Toronto is receiving. Less people die in street racing incidents than in SNOWMOBILE ones. Politicians attempt to create outrage and make an issue out of something that isn't one to begin with.

1. Police discrimination against modified vehicle owners must end immediately.

2. Politicians should stop using made up issues such as street racing to further their own agenda.

3. Modified vehicle owners aren't street racers, people that STREET RACE are street racers.</description>
