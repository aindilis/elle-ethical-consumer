  <description>One day. One night. One community. Your Relay For Life&#174; is about celebration, remembrance, and hope. By participating, you honor cancer survivors, pay tribute to the lives we've lost to the disease, and raise money to help fight it &#8211; all right here in your community. You won't want to miss one moment of this life- and community-affirming event!

If you would like to donate ask me or one of my team members.
