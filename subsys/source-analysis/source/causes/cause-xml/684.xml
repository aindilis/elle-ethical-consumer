  <description>SC Clean air is a collaboration of the Smoke Free Action Network (SFAN) and The South Carolina African American Tobacco Control Network (SCAATCN).  We work to promote smoke-free workplaces for all South Carolinians.

We have been instrumental in getting the following nine municipalities to go smoke free in South Carolina: Sullivan&#8217;s Island, Liberty, Greenville, Columbia, Beaufort County, Bluffton, Charleston, Aiken County, and Hilton Head Island.
