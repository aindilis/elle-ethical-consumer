  <description>My heart is set on supporting and helping the poor mistreatet and tortured Spanish Galgoes, living under terrible conditions in The Great Vacationland of Spain!! 

Those horrific "galgueros" (galgo-owners) need to be stopped once and for all. But as everywhere else, these "clever" and sneaky creatures mostly get away with their terrible actions.

My cause is started to set eye on their act of cruelty against these poor angels, and to support Greyhounds In Needs great work down there.
