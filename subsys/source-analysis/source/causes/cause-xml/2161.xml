  <description>The Linda Blair WorldHeart Foundation was founded out of necessity by award winning actress, humanitarian, and recipient of the coveted Los Angeles Proclamation, Ms. Linda Blair. LBWF's objective is two fold. Primarily, we rescue abandoned and abused companion animals from the harsh city streets and shelters. We provide medical care, socialization, rehabilitation and ensure that they are given a second chance at life, as well as, a forever, loving home. Secondly, by utilizing Ms. Blair's status as a public figure, we are able to bring much needed attention to this growing problem. By calling upon the media as an outlet, we are able to educate and bring awareness to major issues such as pet overpopulation and dog fighting. Please take a minute to visit www.LindaBlairWorldHeart.org for more information.

With your help, We Can Make A Difference!
