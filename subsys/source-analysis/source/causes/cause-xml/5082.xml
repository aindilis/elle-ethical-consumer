  <description>We have got to get someone competent in the white house! This cause is for people who plan to vote or might vote for Barack Obama. Some things Obama stands for as written on his website are: "ending the Iraq War, honoring our commitment to our veterans, achieving energy independence, stopping the genocide in Darfur, improving our schools, and affordable universal health care for every single American."

1. First and foremost just get Bush out!

2. Second vote Obama in!

3. Last have a good country!</description>
