  <description>These agencies are encouraged to apply for financial assistance for training, equipment, search and rescue animals or any item that can help improve their search and rescue efforts.  Our hope is that through providing this additional assistance, these agencies will be better equipped for search and rescue, and therefore be more successful in their efforts to safely return missing persons to their loved ones.
