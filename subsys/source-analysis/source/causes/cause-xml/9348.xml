  <description>during the 90's, scores of women were murdered senselessly and violently, and had their bodies tossed away in the deserts of Ciudad Juarez, a city in Mexico bordering El Paso, Texas. This could still be going on, and the Mexican State Police have been grossly inefficient in finding these murderers. You can make a difference

1. Inform people that these murders occured

2. Encourage better treatment of Women and the Impoverished in general

3. stop senseless murder</description>
