  <description>Whales are living and breathing creatures dammit!
If a boat was to ride over you and cut u up would u like that?? Think about that! Also Whale hunting is very popular and it shouldn't be. People one day will go to whale watch and there will be nothing to watch because so many people have poached them and killed them in brutal and disgusting ways. They are still living and they cut off a fin or eye and torture them until they finally say goodbye to the earth and wither away!
So many whales are in danger of starvation, poaching, and just plain murder that one day the precious creatures that roam the seas will be no more
You can help that by saving these whales so please donate or just plain send out this message the whales are counting on you...

1. Whale hunting must end immediately

2. Whales have the right to live too

3. Living thing or just a stupid piece of nothing?</description>
