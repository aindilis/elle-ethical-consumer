  <description>"This group attempts to expand from just the facebook and connect with the real world. Unlike phony groups about world causes that ask their members to donate money to special causes or describes to them the harmful effects of littering, this group connects with the world in a way that truly unites all members. With a special symbol of trust and loyalty displayed by all members this group promotes the "team" concept. Once joining this group we ask that every member, as a sign of their belief in the Pen15, cause writes PEN15 on their forehead. This simple act will allow fellow group members to identify you as a select supporter of the pen fifteen cause. Through our efforts on facebook we hope that everyone in the world will join this group and display their marks proudly. It may be the last chance at world unity."
