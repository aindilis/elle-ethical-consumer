  <description>Abode for children is a non-profit public charity which is fulfilling the purpose of taking care of orphans around the world. This endeavor is made possible with donations and orphan sponsorships. 

So many of these children are without the pleasures of the western world. These children are the victims of social and financial instability. Some have lost their parents and have no one to fend for them. Some have just fallen through the cracks of this imperfect world and suffer as a result.

Due to the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, the number of children without parents is projected to grow rapidly over the next decade.  Our orphanages provide food, clothing, shelter, an education, and a future for children who have lost everything.  Our vision is to build an orphanage on every continent, which helps us to take care of orphans.  We would like our next orphanage to be in Mexico.  You and other supporters in the United States will be able to visit this orphanage, help to build it, take care of the children, and to teach them.
