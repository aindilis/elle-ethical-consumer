  <description>Since its opening in 1940, Berkeley Iceland has been an important place for the community of Berkeley, California.The oldest skating club in California, Berkeley Iceland played host to the U.S. National Figure Skating Championships in 1947, 1957 and 1966 and was the home club for world and Olympic champion Kristi Yamaguchi. At 200 by 100 ft., the rink surpasses Olympic size.

The owners have closed down the rink since March 31st, 2007, and groups like Cal Ice Hockey and Cal Figure Skating are forced to move their practices and events to Oakland Ice Center. 

Also, landmark status does not prevent the destruction of Berkeley Iceland. A local non-profit, Save Berkeley Iceland, is working to raise $2 million in order to re-open the rink immediately.

1. Raise money for purchasing Iceland, making necessary improvements, and operating the rink for the benefit of the entire East Bay Area community.</description>
