  <description>At least 70 percent of people have suffered a traumatic event at least once in their lives.

Of them, 20% come to develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Trauma includes both human-induced traumas (i.e. rape) and mechanically induced traumas (natural disasters). People in the United States experience trauma from any of the following causes:
Rape
Severe Beating or Assault
Other Sexual Assault
Serious accident or injury
Shooting or stabbing
Unexpected death of family member
Child's life-threatening illness
Witness to killing or serious injury
Natural disaster


People who have endured trauma deserve a chance to recover and develop a healthy way to cope with it.

1. Human induced trauma must end.

2. Sufferers of trauma deserve to acknowledge and process their pain.

3. Trauma sufferers deserve to find hope and gain skills to victoriously recover from their trauma.</description>
