  <description>-We believe that allowing civil marriage in Lebanon is a major step toward reinforcing the dialogue across religions, building one common Lebanese identity and a successful Melting-pot.

-We believe that civil marriage is a right for people who wish no to marry in any of the religious institutions. Freedom of Belief, Decree and thought are essential according to the Universal Declaration of Human rights, articles 18, 19 and 20. 

-We believe that men and women are equal and should enjoy the same social and economical rights.

-We believe that Lebanese women married to foreign guys should be able to pass the Lebanese nationality to their kids.


1. We believe that Civil Marriage is the first step towards a Modern State as it privileges its role and its relation with the citizens.

2. We believe that every Lebanese couple should have the right to get married in Lebanon, regardless of their race, religion, or beliefs.

3. We believe that a unified system of civic rights should be applied to every Lebanese citizen, regardless of her/his race and religion.</description>
