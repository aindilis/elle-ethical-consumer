  <description>uNIGHT: FOR THE CHILDREN OF UGANDA is a grassroots, not-for-profit organization founded in New York in 2005 to galvanize international opinion and support on behalf of the people of northern Uganda, and to help guarantee the future of these
lost youth. 

The children who have borne the brunt of the crisis are the same children who will determine the region&#8217;s future. uNight&#8217;s vision is to build a community of young &#8220;change-makers&#8221; &#8211; youth leaders and social entrepreneurs &#8211; capable of
reclaiming their lives and becoming catalysts for change.

We at uNight, we seek to: 1) provide war-affected children and young adults with immediate physical and psychological care and 2) to equip them with the
community support, social infrastructure and life skills necessary for long-term empowerment. 

To achieve our goals, uNight combines its chapter network abroad (especially in the US and UK) with its youth development initiatives in northern Uganda.

1. If the generations of two generation of Ugandan children who have never known peace are to salvage their future the world has to act now.

2. Urgent and comprehensive dismantlement of the concentration camps in northern Uganda must be made a top priority.

3. Young people- no matter what their circumstances- have the energy, innate ability, and potential to make a difference in their own lives and those of others; the war affected youth deserve the support necessary to help them suceed and rebuild.</description>
