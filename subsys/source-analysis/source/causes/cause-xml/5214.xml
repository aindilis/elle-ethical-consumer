  <description>Quoted from the Invisible Children website: 

"Mission: How We Are Creating Change 

     The Mission is the ultimate goal of Invisible Children. It is the resources, skills, and funds that hit the ground in Uganda. These resources provide health care, safety, education, and employment for the people of Northern Uganda who are affected by this 20-year-long war. It is our belief that we need to live for more, because the invisible children need more to live." 

The children of Northern Uganda need our help! Please join! 

1. Make sure that the resources, skills, and funds reach Uganda. 

2. Help the people of Uganda in any way that we can.

3. No one is left out in getting aid. </description>
