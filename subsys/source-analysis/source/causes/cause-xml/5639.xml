  <description>a few mounths ago my brother was diagnosed with type 1 diabeties. i know it may sound like a lazy diase to some people but its not. when you get diagnosed with diabeties you have to be ona strick diet and if you are not you die of high blood pressure. that means every morning you have to take your blood sugar with a machanicle needle 3 times every single day the rest of your life and you have to take a needle with incelon 2 every day. People who are readign this please take the time to donate money and save a person ro childs life.

1. Diabeties should have easier needles to take their sugar and incolen </description>
