  <description>One person at a time we feel we can make "Super people" into "Super Heroes".  For an excellent example of the types of people we are looking for you could look to Heather and Jenny!  Exceptional people, doing exceptional things everyday!

1. Heather really should be able to realize her childhood dream of becoming Wonder Woman

2. Jenny deserves the chance to kick Sheras ass and take her place, besides she's way hotter than Shera anyway!</description>
