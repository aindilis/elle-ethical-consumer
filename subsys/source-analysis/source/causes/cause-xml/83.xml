  <description>Polar bears face a daunting future. From Big Oil's rigs to toxic chemical pollution to trophy hunting in Canada, these great white bears are fighting for their very survival.

On top of it all, an even greater threat looms: global warming.

Their Arctic home is warming at an alarming rate, and the effects are grim: shrinking sea ice, essential for breeding, denning and hunting, is causing more and more polar bears to starve -- or even drown -- in their search for food. Worse, some are even resorting to cannibalism to survive.

Unless we do something now, polar bears may disappear forever.
