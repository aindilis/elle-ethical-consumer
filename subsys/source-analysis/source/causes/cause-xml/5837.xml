  <description>OmniPeace  was founded by Los Angeles-based entrepreneur, Mary Fanaro, whose vision is to address vital humanitarian needs through the distribution and sale of consumer products, raise awareness of extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and galvanize support for Millennium Promise. By purchasing an OmniPeace  branded product, consumers now have the vehicles to become activists while participating in Millennium Promise&#8217;s call to action.
 There comes a time in every generation when civilization redefines itself and momentum builds to bring down a status quo that people are no longer willing to accept; the abolition of slavery, woman's liberation, the fall of the Berlin wall, apartheid and now extreme poverty and disease. Help give the poorest people in the world a chance to survive by purchasing an OmniPeace branded product.
