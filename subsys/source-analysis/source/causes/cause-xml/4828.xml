Now, someone make an arguement with me on why they are so bad!? I have 3 and they are gorgeous so loyal and very obediant!

It's the owner who makes the dog what it is... if you ban pitbulls than you may aswell ban every damn dog in this world... even little tiny dogs can be vicious... People can be vicious same as animal can be.... but its not there fault so why punish the animal? It's the owner not the dog so please help with this I really want to get rid of this ban!
