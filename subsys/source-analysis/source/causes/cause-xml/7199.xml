  <description>Since its founding in 1985, CitiHope International has followed a humanitarian relief strategy of focusing resources on a few major world areas to make a significant difference in the lives of needy people.

CitiHope strives to uphold the values of stewardship, integrity and compassion exampled through concrete actions of people of faith.

CitiHope International has procured, shipped and distributed over $500 million in medicine, medical supplies, nutritional and developmental resources worldwide since 1990.

Focus countries for 2007 are Belarus, Dominican Republic, Kyrgyzstan, Malawi and Uzbekistan. These countries represent Hope-Filled Initiatives being carried out today! Lives are being saved and changed forever thanks to American generosity and compassion.

Our work may begin with a cup of warm soup and a piece of bread - or a delivery of basic antibiotics - but in the hands of people of faith it becomes a foundation to restore hope and dignity.

CitiHope deeply appreciates the sacred trust afforded by its private donors and corporate partners. You can make a difference in the lives of needy people today by donating today via the link below.
