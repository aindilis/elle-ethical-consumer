  <description>The idea is, that if we throw down the idea of race, of countries, of social classes, Capitalism will have nothing to thrive on. Would there ever have been racism or slavery if it were not for the goverments of the past or our very own capitalism? Doubt it. Slavery was for money. Without racism, the holocaust would have  never happened.  So what if your black, so what if your white, you could be silver for all I care. All these ideas are here to separate us, the people from doing what is right. Instead of fighting tyranny, we fight each other, instead of choosing who we want to lead, there are electoral colleges and corrupt officials, throwing the allegiance with whoever has the biggest checkbook. Thats just plain wrong. Capitalism is a good step from imperialism, and Communism, but were not quite free. Not yet.

1. Choose whats right for our selves, not be told whats right by others.

2. Take the next step in governing ourselves.

3. Take freedom of speech to the next level. Tell your local goverment what you really think.</description>
