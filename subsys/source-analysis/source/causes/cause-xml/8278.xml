  <description>The Alpha Omega Epsilon National Foundation was founded December 5, 1996 by five members of Alpha Omega Epsilon International Sorority who wanted to 
further encourage other women in engineering and technical sciences.

The Foundation was granted tax exempt status under the 501(c)(3) IRS code in March of 1998, retroactive to date of founding.   The 501(c)(3) status allows the 
Foundation to accept tax-deductable donations within the United States.

The AOE National Foundation sponsors an annual scholarship program and awards bi-yearly grants for activities that enhance opportunities for women in engineering and technical sciences.
