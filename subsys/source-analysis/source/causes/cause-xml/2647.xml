  <description>    For decades the leatherback sea turtle has been under siege by humanity.  Long line fishing, beach development and egg poaching have caused major declines in the turtle population and have caused them to become the most endangered sea turtle species on earth.  Fortunately for the turtles, there is an organization, The Leatherback Trust, dedicated to the conservation of the turtles.  This organization buys beaches, protects the beaches and does research on the turtles.

    Leatherback turtles are the largest turtle on earth and are sometimes over 9 feet in length and over 2000 pounds!  The female turtles come onto land in order to lay their eggs in the sand.  They dig a nest approximately two feet deep and lay in it 50 to 100 eggs.  She covers the nest and returns to the sea.  This is really the only time these turtles are seen and therefore very little is known about them.
