  <description>Rubina Hope for Kids was started in memory of Rubina Wong, who passed away during the SE Asia tsunami in Dec 2004. Our short term goal, which was to build a daycare to help those children in Thailand who were directly affected by the tsunami, was accomplished. We now wish to aid other children who are in need. For more information about our non-profit organization, based out of BC, Canada, please visit our website at www.hopeforkids.ca.
