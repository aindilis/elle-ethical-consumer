  <description>In 1933 Adolph Hitler came to power in Germany and threatened to cause genocide against Jewish people in Europe. The world stood by and did nothing, and we all know what happened. Now, in 2007, the Iranian President is threatening Israel with destruction. We need to awaken people to the parallels between 1933 and 2007. Please join this group and make sure we don't allow the mistakes of the past to become the mistakes of the future. Help spread knowledge of this situation to everyone you can and together we can make a true difference in the world.

1. This generation has a duty to learn from the past and build a peaceful future.

2. We must speak up against, and oppose those who threaten to destroy Israel, or any other nation.</description>
