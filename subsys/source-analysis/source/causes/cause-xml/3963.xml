  <description>Our goal is to create a new country somewhere in the world. More than likely it will be in Africa because land is cheap and it would be easy to stage a revolution. Donated money will go towards raising a military, public buildings such as schools, banks, hospitals, or if we raise enough money we will simply buy a country instead of trying to militarily conquering a country.

Oh And the new country will be a democracy, not a totalitarian government, and there will not be a ridiculous amount of laws like most countries, making the new country a haven for all sorts of things such as unrestricted scientific research, weaponry trade, and various other things. Although drugs and gay marriage will not be allowed.

1. A new country should be made.</description>
