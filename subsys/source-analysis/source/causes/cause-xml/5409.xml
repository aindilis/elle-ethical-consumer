  <description>     In May of 1995, Tibet's Panchen Lama was believed to have been kidnapped by the Chinese Government, making him the youngest political prisoner in the world.  
     The Panchen Lama is Tibet's secondmost important religious figure.  He is second only to his holiness the Dalai Lama.  Following the death of a Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama is responsible for recognizing the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama.
     Although his holiness, the Dalai Lama selected Gedun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the Chinese government selected their own Panchen Lama, most likely in an attempt to display absolute power over Tibet's sovereignty.

1. All individuals, regardless of religious beliefs should make an appeal for the safe return of this young political prisoner.

2. Everyone is capable of doing something to help.

3. The Panchen Lama has been missing since May 17, 1995.</description>
