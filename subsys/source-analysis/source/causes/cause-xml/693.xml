  <description>Ever wonder how many tapirs there are left in this world? So have I, and the answer is approximately 153,000. That is close to the amount of people in Queens, which is nothing!!! We must act now to save these shy beasts, will you help?
We all must spend our time and effort on recruiting our friends, peers and acquaintances and on donating money to the cause. These tapirs have lived on this planet for longer than most other vertebrates have. Are we now to neglect them and leave them to perish after all these eons?

1. Tapirs must not become extinct.

2. Tapir hunting must be outlawed.

3. Destruction of the rainforests (the tapirs' natural habitat) must cease.</description>
