  <description>The Athens Music Foundation is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit organization founded on October 31, 2006. 

One of our main missions is to improve the lives of underprivileged youth in Athens, GA. 

Clarke county is one of the poorest counties in the entire nation, and it's the smallest county in the state of Georgia. 

Because UGA takes up most of the county and doesn't pay real estate taxes, there are many children growing up in Athens that are underprivileged. 

We believe that music is a language that can unite young people create a positive impact on their lives. 

Music brings kids together, improves their learning and communication skills, builds self-confidence, allows an outlet for personal expression and creativity, and focuses their energies in positive ways. 

Please spread the word and donate to this cause. 

For more information, you can also email us at athensmusic@gmail.com

Sincerely, 

Brinkley Warren
Co-Founder
