  <description>Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)-- commonly known as the "brittle bone" disorder-- is a genetic disorder characterized by bones that break easily, often from little or no apparent cause. A person with OI may break a rib while coughing, or a leg by rolling over in their sleep. OI has been documented in all ethnic groups, and affects a person throughout their lifetime. This is a disease that my young brother was born with and has suffered from his entire life. And effects hundreds of people throughout the world. There Is NO Cure.

1. Help us alert young people to this disorder and maybe one day a cure can be found.</description>
