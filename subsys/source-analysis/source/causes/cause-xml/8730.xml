  <description>After seven months of working at Ghostrider farms, I never want to see so much neglect at a horse farm again.  We saw horses die, were forced to feed them moldy food, and watch as they were refused regular ferrier work, any turnout time, and no deworming. This has been reported to the Edmonton Humane Society, and is under investigation.

1. Animals lives should be treated with respect and decency

2. There is no excuse to neglect or bring an animal any harm 

3. Spoiled rich owners don't make good owners</description>
