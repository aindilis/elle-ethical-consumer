  <description>This cause is to help raise awareness of self-abuse in its many forms. We need to let people know that self-abuse is not the correct way to solve their problems.

1. Cutting does not solve problems.

2. Anorexia and Bulimia are not good ways to lose weight.

3. Drinking does not solve problems.

4. Drugs do not solve problems

5. Anyone involved in self-abusive tendencies should find someone to speak with immediately.</description>
