  <description>We are members of the undefeatable Dwight Schrute Army of Champions! Our leader, the glorious Dwight Schrute (great-grandson of Dwide Schrude) must be installed Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. And we must fight together for our fearless leader to be installed as Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton FOR IT IS TOGETHER THAT WE PREVAIL!

1. Schrutebucks are worth infinitely more than a Halpertdollar

2. Angela can be in charge of the women

3. I will lead you into the black with ferocity!

4. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also, weak arms.

5. Ryan started the fire!

6. IT IS TOGETHER THAT WE PREVAIL!</description>
