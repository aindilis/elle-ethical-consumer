  <description>Progressive supranuclear palsy is an under-recognized brain disease, often mistaken for Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. Symptoms typically begin in one&#8217;s 60&#8217;s, but can start as early as the 40&#8217;s. Those affected usually survive six to ten years after the initial symptoms occur. In people with PSP, gradual loss of certain brain cells causes slowing of movement and reduced control of walking, balance, swallowing, speaking and eye movement. People with PSP eventually become wheelchair bound or bedridden.

Those with PSP are robbed or their motor functions, while their memories and congitive thinking remains. Although PSP gets progressively worse, no one dies from PSP itself. The most common complications are choking and pneumonia, head injury, and fractures caused by falls. The most common cause of death is pneumonia and starvation, due to the difficulty to swallowing (dysphagia).
