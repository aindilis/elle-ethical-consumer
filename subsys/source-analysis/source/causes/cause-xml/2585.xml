  <description>For many years there has been a big issue with human trafficking in countries such as Cambodia. Children as young as five are being sold into prostitution and distributed to people as sex slaves. Many of these children end up dying in the brothels they are places in due to the many diseases that people are spreading to them. Many people are aware of this problem, but not much is being done to stop it. It's extremely hard to carry children out of these brothels since their families have sold them and they are now the property of these cruel people. With support from enough people there can be a stop to this disgusting trend that is growing at a faster rate than ever before.

1. The sex slave trade needs to be put to an end.

2. Children in these poor countries need to get better medical attention.

3. The brothels need to be shut down completely preventing people from abusing more children.</description>
