  <description>Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer caused by the UV rays from the sun. it is a rare but extremely deadly cancer.  I believe that people should know about this and help donate so doctors and specialists can find ways to get rid of this cancer

1. Melanoma can kill millions of people

2. People think that being careful is dorky, but isn't dorky when you're in chemo therapy!!

3. I have lost 2 members of my family to this cancer and i am at risk of having it myself!</description>
  <mission>show people that even that being careful about the sun is a good thing</mission>
