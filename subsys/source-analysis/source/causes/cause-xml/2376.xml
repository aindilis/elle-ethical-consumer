  <description>Many people are probably confounded by all of the candidates who are in the presidential race for the 2008 election. Many people don't know who to vote for. Who should you vote for? Dennis Kucinich. 

He will get things done, like getting our troops out of Iraq, fixing our education system, making sure universal health care becomes a reality, making sure that everyone's truly equal, etc. The list goes on and on and on. 

Vote for Kucinich '08!!!

1. Our troops should be withdrawn from Iraq.

2. Health care is a universal right.

3. Our education system needs fixing.

4. Same-sex marriage should be allowed.

5. The death penalty should be abolished because it's cruel and inhumane.

6. The Patriot Act is unconstitutional.

7. War is never the answer and using assissination for political purposes is wrong.

8. America should leave WTO and NAFTA to protect American jobs.</description>
