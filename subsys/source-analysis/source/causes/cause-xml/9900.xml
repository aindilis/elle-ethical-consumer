  <description>most people don't think of domestic violence as being a big deal, but it is and it is a crime. more women than you know are going through domestic violence and abuse at this very second, and are not strong enough to get out and save themselves.  more than half of domestic violence cases go unreported. and most cases involve children. we also need to consider the children...seeing their mother be abused is not exactly a healthy influence. it can be stopped!!
