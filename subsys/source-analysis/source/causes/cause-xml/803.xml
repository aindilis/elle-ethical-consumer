  <description>The biggest issues faceing most people today can all really be boiled down to someone(s) somewhere sucking. Go aheads, think about how much would be helped if the suckage facter of people was reduced.

And that. . . that would be just great.

2. But if they do, they should contain the suckage so that it does not get up into others grillz. </description>
