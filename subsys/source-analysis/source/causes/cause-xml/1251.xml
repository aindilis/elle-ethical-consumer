  <description>Gentrification has become a grave concern within the Washington, DC area.  With little affordable housing, many families are struggling to survive.  The goal of our organization is to provide these families with safe, comfortable, affordable housing and alleviate some of the issues they are facing.  The group depends greatly upon the monetary support and time provided by volunteers.  Due to the fact that Habitat for Humanity is charging our group to volunteer and has greatly discouraged support from college students in our area, this group is now affiliated with the Fuller Center. The Fuller Center was also created by Millard Fuller after the board of Habitat for Humanity International forced him to resign from the organization he began.
