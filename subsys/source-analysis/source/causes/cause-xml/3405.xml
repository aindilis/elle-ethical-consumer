  <description>This is meant to explain that Agnosticism is not the same as Atheism. It is not the belief that no God exists. 

The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as:
One who holds that the existence of anything beyond and behind material phenomena is unknown and (so far as can be judged) unknowable, and especially that a First Cause and an unseen world are subjects of which we know nothing.
[Suggested by Prof. Huxley at a party held previous to the formation of the now defunct Metaphysical Society, at Mr. James Knowles's house on Clapham Common, one evening in 1869, in my hearing. He took it from St. Paul's mention of the altar to &#8216;the Unknown God.&#8217; R. H. HUTTON in letter 13 Mar. 1881.] 

In laymen's terms, this means that is impossible for anyone to determine the true existence of a god, whether it be Chrisitian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Buddist, or any other major religion. One can not prove the existence of god without being dead first (and then it would be hard to tell everyone). 

This is not a money making idea...This is just a cause for information...to inform the world that agonstics are on a ceasless quest for answers, some of which may never be discovered; this, however, does not diminish the drive of agnostics to seek those answers regardless, nor to accept them without necessary empirical evidence

1. Inform the world about agnosticism

2. Atheism and agnosticism are hugely different</description>
