  <description>  I started this cause because my little brother, Patrick, has a mitochondrial disorder. It prevents him from walking, talking, seeing, and possibly more.
  The mitochondria convert food into energy for the cell which makes the cells be able to function properly, but if the mitochondria cannot produce the energy, then the cell cannot function properly. 
  About one in 4,000 children in the United States will develop mitochondrial disease by the age of 10 years. One thousand to 4,000 children per year in the United States are born with a type of mitochondrial disease.
  For many patients, mitochondrial disease is an inherited condition that runs in families. An uncertain percentage of patients acquire symptoms due to other factors, including mitochondrial toxins.

As of now, there are no cures for mitochondrial diseases, but in time and with the development of modern medicine, hopefully there will be one day.

1. To find a cure we must create awareness of mitochondrial diseases.

2. I want people to know that they aren't alone in the struggle against this disease.</description>
