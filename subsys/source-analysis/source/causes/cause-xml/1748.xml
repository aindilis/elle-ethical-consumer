  <description>Malaria kills close to One million people annually, most of them children.

This disease can be stopped by $5 bednets. 100% of the funds donated to against malaria is used to buy nets. There are no marketing expenses etc. We are all volunteers.

On World Malaria Day (April 25) we are attempting to blackout facebook to help shine a light of darkness to highlight the catastrophe that is malaria. Please mark here that you are attending the blackout - http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=157541787600581&amp;ref=ts and please invite your friends to attend.

1. Malaria is a disease without borders

2. One million malaria deaths each year is a genocide of apathy.

3. Nets cost $5 - last for five years </description>
