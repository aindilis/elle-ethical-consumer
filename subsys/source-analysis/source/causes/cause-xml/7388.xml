  <description>Far too long has the Emo people poisoned our minds and media with their belief system and their infuriating "ideas". Think of the children! The corruption must end! If this "race" of people continue their campaign against sane families and sensible thought, the future of our nations will be at stake. We must stop the Emos before they control our very minds. Stop The Spread Of Emo Culture At All Costs Before It Is Too Late! 

1. The Emo race is an infectious disease

2. The abolation of ALL Emo culture from media

3. Inform our youth the dangers of "trying to act different" and that the Emo Persuasion will corrupt their minds </description>
