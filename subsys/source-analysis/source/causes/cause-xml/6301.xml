  <description>This is for anyone against the BSL (breed specific legislature)  put in place in Ontario and anywhere else that has a ban against "pit bull" type dogs, including the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier and any mix of them. This ban was put into place August 2005, and many animals have been euthanized simply for being the "wrong breed". 
--------------------------------------------------------------

However, what most fail to realize is one key clause in Bill 132.

Found on the forums of Dogomania; poster: mutts4me
"Ontario's Bill 132 permits an officer to enter your home without a warrant and seize or destroy your dog, regardless of breed. Destroy your dog in your home."

Whether you are for against the ban, if you own a dog, you can't possibly agree with this!
We are getting our rights as dog owners taken away from us!

1. Pit Bulls are no more prone to aggression than any other dog.

2. Pit Bulls jaws' are no stronger than any other dog of its' size.

3. The dogs' owner is responsible for it's behavior, through upbringing and training.</description>
