  <description>Please help us by making a difference in the needed ones lifes. And show that you want to help making a difference. Start by joining this group. And work from that. Donate old clothes that you don't wear anymore. Donate left over birthday money or christmas money. Because it might be hard to belive for some but they need it ALOT more than we do! If you want to make a difference in the world, show the world that you can. And start right here. Because everynight kids like us don't have parents to say "good night" to them. And don't have a bed to sleep in. But sooner-or-later if we all start to help make a difference that little bit of difference can change a life. Please join and donate.
