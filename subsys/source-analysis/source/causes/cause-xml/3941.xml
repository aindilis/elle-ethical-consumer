  <description>Rail based mass transit has many advantages over bus based transit. 

-Rail transit usually operates over separate right of ways, and is not usually affected by traffic jams. 

-Train wheels on iron rails have a friction force equal to  ice skating. 

-Rail transit can carry many more people per unit than a bus can, at significantly less pollution. 

-During peak times, trains can be expanded to hold more people, and during light times, trains can be cut down to use less fuel. 

-Many rail transit systems use electric engines powered by overhead wires or third rail, this energy may be generated cleanly.

-Train accidents are rare.
