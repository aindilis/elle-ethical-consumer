  <description>I have gone through many trials and tribulations when it comes to True Beauty! What is it? Where can I find it? Who has the right definition?

I have found some of these answers but not all...

Thats were you come in! The point of this cause is to spark awareness and discussion about where True Beauty comes from and how we can help each other find it!

There will be many different types of girls who join this group... but since there is no definite answer lets all join together young, old, black, white, fat, skinny, tall, short, popular, outcasts and help each other

1. That everyone has True and Genuine Beauty... I just want us all to find it!</description>
