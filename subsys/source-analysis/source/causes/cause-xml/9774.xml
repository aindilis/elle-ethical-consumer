  <description>Sarcoidosis is a complex multisystem autoimmune disease which affects the lungs, skin, joints, eyes, brain, and other soft tissue organs.  It is often misdiagnosed.  At this time, there is no known cure for sarcoidosis.  I want to create an awareness for this because often times doctors do not know how to diagnose this disease.

1. Create Sarcoidosis awareness.

2. Teach doctors correct diagnostic tools.</description>
