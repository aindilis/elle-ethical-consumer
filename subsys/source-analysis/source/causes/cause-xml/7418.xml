  <description>It's ridiculous that ferrets are illegal to own in the state of California. 48 of the 50 states allow ferrets to owned and sold..so why not California. They're afraid of over population. If a domesticated ferret escapes its chances of survival are extremely low. It would more than likely starve to death or be killed by a predator. So, please, lets all sign the petition to legalize them!! 
It's ridiculous to outlaw such amazing, beautiful and smart creatures.

ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU SIGN THIS PETITION AND INVITE AS MANY FRIENDS AS YOU CAN!! PLEASE!!!
