  <description>Our goal is to protect a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body.  This includes the right to an abortion if she so chooses.

We believe that choice is a precious and beautiful right, and should be guarded.

1. Abortion should be legal.

2. Roe v. Wade should be protected.

3. A woman's body is her own business, not the government's.

4. Birth control should be readily available to all women.</description>
