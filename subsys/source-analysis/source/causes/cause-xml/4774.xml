  <description>Founded in 1957, The Meeting School is a coed Quaker boarding and day school and working farm for students in grades 9-12. TMS prepares students with life skills as well as academic knowledge. At The Meeting School, 30-40 boarding and day students in grades 9-12 live, work and learn together. Students and faculty share the work and the joy of life in community, small classes (typically 5-7 students), and raising food on our organic farm. Boarding students live together in our five faculty houses. We cook together, clean together, eat together, reflect together, play together and grow together. Learning is hands-on, authentic, vital and experiential. Students learn important skills for every area of life. The community takes the time to make important decisions collectively, in the manner of Quakers. Young people with initiative and vision can make a real difference at The Meeting School!

1. The school community cultivates a simple lifestyle where students experience intellectual, physical, and spiritual work.
