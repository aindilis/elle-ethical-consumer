  <description>People of this world, it is time we joined forces to give our support to the Smurfs. They are a small ethnic group that are not allowed live like us. 

Forever have they being harassed by Gargamel and the rest of his cronies. 

They are human being just like you and me. Sure they may be a little small and blue. But is that reason enough to desert.

I call on all of you with compassion in your heart to join my fight. 

Love live the Smurfs

1. Smurfs must be awarded basic human rights

2. End the discrimination against Smurfs

3. Live for the day when they can walk side by side with me to the pub</description>
  <mission>ensure Smurfs are awarded the same civil rights are you and I</mission>
