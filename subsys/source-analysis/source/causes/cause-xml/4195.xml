  <description>"More than just a &#8220;bad headache,&#8221; migraine is a legitimate, biological disease affecting 28 million Americans &#8211; equivalent to 13 percent of the U.S. population. According to data released by the National Headache Foundation, one in every four U.S. households has a migraine sufferer."
