  <description>Alcohol and drugs are universal in this world, and it is harder for some of us to ignore it than others. The people like us that know that alcohol and drugs ruin your dreams and future need to help everyone else understand and help those who have already fallen for the drugs.

1. Overdose of drugs/alcohol will ruin millions of futures.

2. People in this world need to be more aware about the effects of drugs and alcohol.

3. The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.

4. Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced

5. Where there is no vision, there is no hope.</description>
