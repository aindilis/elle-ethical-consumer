  <description>This cause benefits the National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force, which is one of the largest groups in the country working to further the rights of GLBTQ people nationwide.  They work on everything from adoption rights and marriage rights to gender issues and hate crimes to health to issues surrounding young people (such as gender-on-campus, coming out, homelessness, etc).

1. All GLBTQ-identified people should have the same rights as anyone else

2. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression should be illegal

3. Same-sex couples deserve the same rights as opposite-sex couples</description>
