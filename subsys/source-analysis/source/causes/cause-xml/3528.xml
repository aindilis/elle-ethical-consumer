  <description>Cancer Research is a well known charity organisation that needs your help. They need us all to donate money in order to help create a cure for cancer. It seems an impossible dream to find a cure for this life-threatning disease but the more we try, the more likely we are to save the ones we loved. 

Every person will lose someone close to them and the most likely cause will probably be a form of cancer.

Research has developed in cancer and we know more about cancer now than we did, say, 20 years ago. However, it doesn't stop us from losing the ones we love but with your help in promoting the cause and donating to the cause, you too can save a life.

1. Cancer effects us all at one point in our lives. We can't run away from it

2. I have lost someone very very close to me to lung cancer and I would hate to be in the position of losing somebody else to cancer

3. You yourself may one day have a terminal illness and you too will appreciate all the help that is given. Life should be fought for instead of ignored. Cancer is just another obstacle that we can fight against but we need all te help we can get!</description>
