  <description>Every day the world's shark population shrinks.  Some estimates suggest that over 100 million sharks are slaughtered every year.  At this rate, the risk of extinction draws ever closer for certain species.  'Finning' or the killing of sharks and dumping of their carcass after the dorsal fin is removed is the primary culprit for the massive numbers of sharks killed annually.

Help join the fight to save one of the world's most incredible animals and prevent an ecological catastrophe.
