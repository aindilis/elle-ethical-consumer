  <description>We are an outpost for the Cincinnati Community Kollel in the northers suburbs of Cincinnati (Mason).  Our purpose is to offer Jewish educational experiences to Jews who are looking for more.  We attempts to reach people at their level, and to give them what they need.  Over 150 Jews have been touched by our programming in our first years of operation.
