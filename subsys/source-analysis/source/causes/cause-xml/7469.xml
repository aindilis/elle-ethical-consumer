  <description>The Avery County Humane Society's goal is to ensure its animals find their true "forever home" with responsible, committed pet owners. 

While we strive to achieve our goal, the Avery County Humane Society is unique from other area animal shelters in that, due to the absence of a county operated animal control program, the burden of animal welfare rests entirely on us. 

We also work with local area vets to provide low-cost spaying and neutering for all of our pets. 

***Statistics from January 1, 2007***

180 Dogs have been adopted or reclaimed.
63 Cats have been adopted or reclaimed.

The Avery Humane Society is always in need of volunteers and donations. On our website, you may participate in our "Virtual Adopt-a-Pet Program" which sponsors a shelter pet for a one time donation of $35 or a monthly donation of $10 through PayPal or through e-mailing us at "adoptapet@vol.com" (all donations are tax exempt). 

We can be reached by phone at (828) 733-6312.

1. Pets deserve loving and committed pet owners who will provide them with a "forever home."

2. Pets should not face death waiting for their forever home.

3. Humans are responsible for the welfare of animals - if the government will not provide for animal welfare, we will. </description>
