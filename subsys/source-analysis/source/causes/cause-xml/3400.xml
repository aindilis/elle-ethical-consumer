  <description>The generation that we are living in is surrounded, englufed, and controlled by violence. But as we live to far away from violence we seem to forget that its going on all around us. If our voices arent heard and we dont act on what we believe then nothing is ever going to change, and peace will never come. We need to use our voices, express our opinions, and act on our beliefs. The government and the world must know that we do not stand down and let everyone else dictate our lives. The time is now to advocate peace and stop world voilence and war. It is our civil right and duty as people of the world to do what we believe to be right, and stop letting governments tell us what is right and wrong. The governmant can not go against what we do not intend to support. This is Our County. This is Our World.
