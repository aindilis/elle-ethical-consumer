  <description>Recently I read about a most horrifying and despicable practice in Pakistan.  Equally if not worse than the practice of 'honor killings'.  

In a report titled 'Married to the Quran' in the Pakistani weekly newspaper 'The Friday Times' of Pakistan, it said: 

"According to Khabrain, a large number of feudals in Sindh had married their daughters to the Quran. The ceremony took place after the girl of the family was asked to take a bath, after which a Quran was put before her as the men folk apologised to her for the ritual which would condemn the girl never to get married but to read the Quran every day. In Sindh, MPA Shabbir Shah&#8217;s sister, ex-minister Murad Shah&#8217;s sister and two daughters, three daughters of Mir Awwal Shah of Matiari, daughters and sisters of Sardar Dadan and Nur Khan of the Lund tribe, nieces of Sardar Ghulam of Mahar tribe, and the daughters of the Pir of Bharchundi Sharif, were all married to the Quran to prevent their share of the land going to them and thus avoid redistribution of land."


1. This is an extremely Jihaaliyat (uncivilised) and UNISLAMIC Practice

2. NOT IN THE NAME OF ISLAM</description>
