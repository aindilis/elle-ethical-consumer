  <description>Essential2Life is an extended family for Atlanta's urban youth. Six days a week for the past decade in Atlanta, Georgia, we have gone where few people care to venture - directly into our city's public housing communities. We deliver Kid's Explosion, an innovative after-school program, to three of the poorest neighborhoods. Using two custom-designed mobile units, we attract almost 3,000 kids per week to hear culturally relevant messages of hope using games, music, skits, and illustrations. Most importantly, we visit almost 1,500 children and their families weekly in their homes. Because we know that nothing is more effective for making a lasting impact on their lives than a personal relationship with our children.
