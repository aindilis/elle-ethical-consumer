Follow the link to add your signature to petition parliament. The more signatures that are collected the more we can be heard.
Signing the petition will not take more than 3 minutes.
This is not for profit of any kind. DO NOT SEND MONEY. In order for our voice to be heard we need to come together. 
I realize that some of this does not affect you directly but if you have children in school you will see it from their eyes. No child deserves less than others. All opportunities should be equal among all children in any community.
Using 2005 figures: a Canadian family making under $22,000 receives $1945 / yr for 1 child. While receiving assistance a person has $1463 deducted - leaving $482 for the year. 

(For more facts on the amounts received please visit Income Security Advocacy Centre)

Again follow the above link to sign the petition.
