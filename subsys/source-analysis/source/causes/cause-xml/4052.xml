  <description>Being 18 years old, and a smoker for about four years now, I've come to the realization that raising cigarette taxes is not the answer. By raising a cigarette tax, you are not only hurting the smoker, who already pays an outrageous amount of money to enjoy premium tobacco products, but also the little guy. The corner store who's main source of income is selling milk and cigarettes to the locals. By raising his or her cigarette tax, now he must still sell those cigarettes, and the people get mad because they must pay more for their products. Smokers should not have to support the government more than they already do. It is not fair that because people do not agree with what we do (smoking) that we should have to pay more. They have already banned us (Rhode Islanders) and I am sure many more states, with smoking inside of any public establishment. What is next? Not being able to smoke in your own home? It is not fair, and the government trys to regulate these things but allowing higher taxes. Please talk to your congressmen and tell them to vote NO on any proposition that decries higher taxes on tobacco.
