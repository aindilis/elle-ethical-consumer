  <description>SFP Girls deserve to wear skirts!
*Guys want skirts back because they are tired of hearing girls complain about not having skirts and how they have to wear their dreadful pants!

1. Girls Should Be Allowed To Wear Skirts!

2. Every other Catholic school, whether co-ed or same female sex, is allowed to wear skirts, why shouldn't Prep be allowed that same privilage?

3. Just becuase there are a few bad apples in the tree doesnt mean the whole tree it self is bad! ( I mean just because some girls wear it inappropriately doesnt mean they all will!)</description>
