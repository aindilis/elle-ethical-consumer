  <description>The Advocates for Self-Government is a nonprofit, nonpartisan, educational organization, founded in 1985. We:

1. take the ideas of liberty to the public and to opinion leaders, in an honest, persuasive manner, and by doing so discover and create more libertarians and help bring about a more powerful libertarian movement;

2. help libertarians become effective and successful communicators of libertarian ideas;

3. strive to change the dominant political "map" from the old, inaccurate "left-right" model -- which excludes libertarians -- to a more accurate and inclusive map such as that found on our World's Smallest Political Quiz.

1. Individuals have inalienable rights to life and liberty.

2. It is wrong to initiate FORCE against others.

3. Everyone is better off when individual liberty is maximized and government is limited to protecting that liberty.</description>
