  <description>Please help this cause by donating or simply advertising this attempt to end child illiteracy. In 1999, 66% of high school seniors taking a basic economic literacy test failed. The results were worse in 2000 and 2001. The literacy level in America is more than shocking, it's unacceptable. With donations and community support, we will be able to provide underprivileged children with the option of a literate mind and with hope, a contributing place in society. Education builds a stronger society, a stronger world. Please help me generate this dream into a fervent reality. 

1. Illiteracy must end. 

2. Children must be cared for. 

3. Education builds a stronger society. </description>
