  <description>Yeah, so I'm asking everyone on facebook to each give me two dollars. Jeffersons ($2 bills) are preferred, but I will be happy to accept two Washingtons or change out a Lincoln, Hamilton, Jackson etc...

I'm sure those of you who are giving this cause the time of day to investigate it are wondering "Why the hell should I give this guy two dollars?"
Great question. I'll accept lesser or greater amounts as well.

For you skeptics who may be wondering "Why should I give this guy any money at all?" 
Well, I'll tell you why you shouldn't not give me money. I'm not a strange, smelly, hobo waiting outside a gas station or Albertson's at 2 am trying to score some cash for crack or a 40 of Schlitz.

You know you've given those social parasites money before and you know it hasn't gone to food. So that you know where this money will go, it will probably be invested in my skydiving career to help advance myself within the sport.

If you are interested in making a donation, please feel free to call up Marcus at 954-303-0377 and arrangements will be made.
