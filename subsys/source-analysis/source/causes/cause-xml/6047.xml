  <description>In Europe and other parts of the world there is a disease spreading and it is becoming rife! Footballers have developed a condition that makes them loose the use of their legs should a player from the opposing team come within touching distance. This causes a dramatic and often comical fall from grace.

Unfortunately this disease is spreading as more foreign players decide to play in the greatest league in the world....The Premiership!

We cant let this disease spread and must help those most affected, namely Cristiano Ronaldo and Didier Drogba. How we will help them is up to you!!!

1. The english game must not be tarnished

2. Those affected look like complete wankers</description>
