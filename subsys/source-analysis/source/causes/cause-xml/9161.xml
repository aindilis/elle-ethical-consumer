  <description>Now I am sure you have all seen the pics and heard the news about the flooding in the UK, assuming you don't actually live there and are experiencing this for yourself, well for me you all know how I feel about England so I decided to contact the mayor of Gloucester where the worst flooding has happened, and have gotten the information for their flood fund. Many people in that area have lost everything so for those of you who know about my gallery and for those of you that don't here is the link www.wiccangodess.deviantart.com, or you can go to www.wiccangodess.com and I have let the mayor's office  know that all profits from any sales of my prints or other merchandise there will be donated to their fund.

If you would prefer to make a donation directly I have the contact information for those that are interested.

As well if anyone is interested in holding a fundraising tournament for them please do let me know. 

Thank you all for your help in this. Every small gesture no matter how small is huge right now for those that have lost everything there.
