  <description> What is Straight Edge?


Straight edge is a life long commitment to abstain absolutely from all forms of recreational drugs including alcohol and cigarettes, and to abstain from promiscuous sex.

These are the only guidelines for straight edge; all other lifestyle choices such as diet, religion, and political views are all optional disciplines often associated with straight edge.

Straight edge is an independent philosophy and is not directly associated with any creed, trend, music, sexual preference, religion or principle. The the ONLY requirements of adopting a straight edge lifestyle is lifelong abstention from drugs and promiscuous sex.

The straight edge oath is one for life, taken to the grave (til' death). Straight edge is not for everyone. Straight edge is not flexible. Straight edge is a radical commitment to stay free of addiction and the destructive escapism common to society for your entire life. If you cannot maintain this promise until death, it is not for you.
