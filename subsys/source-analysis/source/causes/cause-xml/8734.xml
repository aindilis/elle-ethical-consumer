  <description>in 2006 USA Today reported that the average American college graduate has $24,000 of debt after obtaining their BA/BS degree, and a multiple of that number after pursuing a graduate degree (a prerequisite for many health care fields)

How can you help this epedemic

The Ben Fund is an IRS unrecognized non profit organization with the sole goal of helping one of these students pay off their debt from their pursuit of a Masters Degree in Physical Therapy.

In order to achieve this goal The Ben Fund needs to raise $50,000.

send your donation (no amount to small) to the Ben Fund and help this graduate put himself on the road towards achieving the American Dream.
