  <description>People Eating Tasty Animals.  That's who we are.  We love the taste of a rare slab of steak.  So rare that you can practically hear the cow mooing on the plate.   

1. Increasing the amounts of animals consumed each and every day.

2. We hold high the belief that animals belong in your stomach, not in the wild.

3. ONLY 269 chickens are killed each second... I'm saying we could squeeze a few more in there.

4. Pigs are friends... Not food...?  HAHAHA

5. Caesar Salad?  Better have some chicken on it!</description>
