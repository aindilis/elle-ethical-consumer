  <description>CREA was founded on the principals that conservation is not possible without research, education and action.  Environmental protection efforts cannot exist independently of community support and sustenance measures.  Therefore  CREA takes a holistic view, developing projects in conjunction with the efforts of local populations.  Our projects range from species protection to subsistance farming to rainforest restoration and protection.  We operate out of Panama City but have a field station at the Cocobolo Reserve where we have protected 1000 acres of private forest and where we develop most of our programs working with the farmers in the Mamoni Valley.

1. We are dependent on the rainforests found on the Central American isthmus.

2. Reduction of poverty and environmental protection go hand-in-hand. Environmental degradation is a result of economic struggle.

3. Hands-on education/training is necessary to teach the rural poor skills to enable sustainable livelihoods that benefit communities and the environment</description>
