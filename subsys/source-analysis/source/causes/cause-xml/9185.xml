  <description>Stated simply, we exist to provide meaningful opportunities for building relationships among Christian leaders, ministries and local churches, for the purpose of nurturing and equipping them to be more effective in building and multiplying strong local churches worldwide. We seek to provide sanctuary for ministers everywhere they can be supported, accepted, equipped, mentored, nurtured and strengthened. We seek to build Christ-centered relationships, provide resources for ministerial enrichment resulting in both personal and church growth, and provide opportunities for interaction with seasoned and gifted pastors with whom to personally consult, and provide equipping principles to assist each of our members in achieving their personal and ministerial goals. 

1. The Gospel of Jesus must be spread in all the nations.

2. Ministers and Missionaries must be equipped to carry the Word

3. It is the obligation of the Body of Christ to go and make disciples of the nations.</description>
