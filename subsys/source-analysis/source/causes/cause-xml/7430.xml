  <description>I'm sure you've all seen the home videos and the interviews.  Britney Spears has officially become a self-destructive time bomb.  Please find it in the kindness of your hearts, to put forth all your efforts in resurrecting the once-revered pop sensation.  (Don't pretend like your room wasn't wall-papered in Britney posters and magazine cut-outs.)  With a little bit of love from everyone, it is possible that Britney Spears might possibly be able to recover from her over-dyed hair disasters, her unusual speech retardations, K-Fed, her incessant drug use, K-Fed, her crocht bearing photographs, her baby "mishaps", the joke that is K-Fed, her dateline interview, her belief in time-speed travel, and basically any action or speech that she has produced in the last 4 years.

1. These cherades must end immediately.

2. If you keep the hope alive, it is possible she may recover.

3. If not, at least we could try to get child protective services to take her kids. : /</description>
