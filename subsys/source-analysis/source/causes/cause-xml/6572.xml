  <description>The mission of Baykeeper is to protect and enhance the water quality of the San Francisco Bay and its tributaries for the benefit of its ecosystems and human communities.  Baykeeper fills a unique water quality niche in the Bay Area by acting as the watchdog for the Bay and enforcing clean water laws in order to protect and restore the watershed.

1. San Francisco Bay is a remarkable natural resource that should be protected from pollution.

2. Everyone has a right to clean water -- our waterways don't belong to polluters.</description>
