  <description>We are the B.E.E.(Bee Empathy Experts), and we're for the liberation and proper treatment of bees. Did you know that most modern factories have bee killing rooms? A room that has nothing to do with production of there product, purposely built for the meaningless slaughtering of bees. And how do you think they get honey? It doesn't matter at all that bees produce honey naturally, they harvest the honey that bees make anyway. !!!!!!. Please help us put a stop to the harming of bees everywhere. Hopefully one day, we can all live in a peaceful world where no one kills bees. And we may all live among each other in harmony :').
