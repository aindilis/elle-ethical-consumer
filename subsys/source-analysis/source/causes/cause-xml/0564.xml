  <description>"The Mater Ecclesiae Fund for Vocations works to accelerate and to prevent the abandonment of vocations by guaranteeing the eventual retirement of the student loans of men and women who have generously answered a call to religious life. Similarly, we seek to help men answering the call to the diocesan priesthood.

The Fund for Vocations has taken over this important work from the Fraser Family Foundation which has issued 30 grants in the past three years. Twenty-one of those grants are still in force and the men and women who received them are now in formation and beginning a consecrated life of prayer for our Church and our world. Without those grants, they would be struggling in the workaday world to pay down their debt and meet expenses."
