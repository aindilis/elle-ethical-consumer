  <description>The mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.

I've been a scout chef and then an assistant scout chef since 1993.  In the last few years, I've been working for the 128e Scout troup in St-Conrad Parish, Anjou, Montreal, Quebec.

We are members of "L'Association des Scouts du Canada", the French Canadian Boy Scout.

We work in a poor Parish and most of our young Scouts can't afford to pay for any supplies for the camps.

For any donations, please send checks at "Les Scouts du Montreal Metropolitain" to the attention of 128e Groupe St-Conrad(http://www.scoutsmm.qc.ca/public/accueil.php) at:
