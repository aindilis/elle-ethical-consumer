  <description>From the craptacular "Armageddon" to the depressingly  mediocre "Transformers" remake, this camera-shaking hack has pinched out one cinematic turd too many!

Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?  Because nobody ever does anything to stop him!

1. A film entitled "Transformers" should focus on the Transformers.

2. A fim entitled "Pearl Harbour" should be about Pearl Harbour and not some stupid love triangle.

3. STOP SHAKING THE CAMERA ALREADY!  I CAN'T SEE WHAT'S GOING ON!</description>
