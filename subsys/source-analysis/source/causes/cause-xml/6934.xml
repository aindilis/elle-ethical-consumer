  <description>So you've put little boxes on your profile advertising something you care about. Great! Good job. How is that helping?

All the awareness in the world won't solve anything if there's not genuine action to go along with it. If you care about climate change, make a genuine effort to use less energy and fuel. If you want what's-their-name for president, vote for them, work on the campaign, encourage people old enough to vote for them, whatever actually DOES something. Volunteer places, send food or money, whatever it takes.

A Facebook application ain't gonna change the world.

1. There is crap wrong with the world.

2. It's important to be aware of this fact, but awareness alone won't help.

3. Do something. That helps.</description>
