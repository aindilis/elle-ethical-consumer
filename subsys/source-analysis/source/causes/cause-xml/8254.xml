  <description>In 2007 there were a total of 917 reports or animal abuse reported in the U.S. This is a revolving case that continually gets ignored... people all over the world are beating, hoarding, abandoning, shooting, and burning animals just to name a few of the creul thing people do for their enjoyment. Not only is this wrong but, in 2007, 39 abuse cases were due to acts of 10 year olds or YOUNGER. The point of this mission is to get it known around the country of what people are doing to innocent animals and to get it stopped. This can no longer be ignored... so join the fight against abuse to animals in the U.S. and help hundreds of poor, neglected animals.

1. Abuse and neglect to animals MUST be stopped.

2. Don't let anymore innocent animals be killed.

3. Animal abusers must be brought to justice.</description>
