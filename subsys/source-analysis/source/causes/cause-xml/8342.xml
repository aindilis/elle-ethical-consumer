  <description>The Childrens best interest, is a place where the voice 's of children can be encourged, and their rights respected,, and their parents can share all of what has worked for them, in being GOOD parents, and loving and nurturing, and teaching their children how to live in todays world. We need to work hard to abolish the attitude of violence and racism and hatred in our youngest generation by teaching them to feel pride and have dreams and goals, and No fear! We need to encourage the home to be a safe loving place for them to seek sanctuary from the world outside, because no child should ever seek a place away from loving famiy unless they dont know what that is, and they are trying to fill a void,and looking for love they never had. So overall the mission is to educate  and spread the word on what childrens rights are and what is in their best interest for their growth and development! 

1. No child should live without positive encouragment!

2. No child should ever be verbally , emotionally, physically, or mentally abused or mistreated!

3. Love is something they should be given unconditionally, even when they make huge  mistakes or bad choices, because that is the process of learning, and should be supported in all ways possible.</description>
