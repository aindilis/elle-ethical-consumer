  <description>Through Affordable College for America (ACA), and its partner companies, we will show the government the importance of changing their policy over federal student and parent loans.

The federal parent loan and student loan policy of the U.S. is wrong and needs to to be updated.

The current policy bases the amount of an award or type of an award primarily on the financial contribution of the family.  The family contribution is calculated through household income (HHI) and doesn't take into consideration whether the family has other major expenses.
