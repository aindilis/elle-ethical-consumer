  <description>MTV was launched by the end of 1990.
Thanks to a dynamic and creative crew, MTV 
has always been a forerunner in the Lebanese 
audiovisual sector. Its challenge was to innovate
and its local production as SLCHI, Khallik Maana,
Cin&#233; Cin&#233;phile, Mini Studio, MTV Sports, Chouf 
Halak, Kel Mayle Ayle are the best proof of its 
success. MTV also broadcasts major American
series, TF1 and France 2 programs, CNN news, 
as well as Formula One, NBA, and UEFA Cup.
