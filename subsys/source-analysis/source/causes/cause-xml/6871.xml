  <description>Trying to rescue Egypt from all the trash and limiting the litter all over the country- at least as much as w can. We must also support recycling. This is a NON-PROFIT cause.

1. It's everybody's right to live in a clean country.

2. It is our duty towards our country to save it, we aren't waiting for someone to save it for us.

3. Egypt is ranked in the top most garbage-filled countries in the world.</description>
