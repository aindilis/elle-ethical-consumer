  <description>Regardless of your stance on the current wars or our elected leadership, we support out troops. Whether in garrison or on the front line, we support them. Regardless of the mission, we support the people.

This group is from a soldier, for the soldier, and everyone that loves one.

Please call, email, or at least pray for our leadership in Washington to make the best decisions about the war in Iraq and Afghanistan; and all other world conflicts, regardless of your opinion of it.
