Marianne and her husband Dave were delighted to learn that they had become pregnant on their honeymoon.  Marianne's pregnancy was uneventful and extremely joyful.  They anxiously awaited the arrival of their daughter and the day finally came, January 28th, 2003.  Due to a cord accident during labour, their precious little girl was born still.
