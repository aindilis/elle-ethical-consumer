  <description>This is not a money making scheme. In fact, I don't want nor need any donations. This is just a way to bring the idea to of self-mutilation to the forefront of your mindset. This is an overlooked health issue because so few people report it to therapists and other medical professionals. Let this be a way for us to get the word out and possibly provide some success stories about overcoming these important issues.

1. To provide information about self-mutialtion

2. To provide a forum for those who wish to speak out against it

3. To bring SM to the conscious of the world</description>
