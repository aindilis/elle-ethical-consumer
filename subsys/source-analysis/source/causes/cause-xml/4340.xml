  <description>We at the S.T.G. foundation, believe that to be yourself is the right way, but when schools and workplaces take away your right to be individual, as stated in the 1st Amendment of the Constitution, you have got to fight back. Our mission is to break down barriers between all social groups and cliques, and show them what and who goths really are. Too long people like us have been treated badly because of stereotypes or because of what people believe we are, we need to come together and rise up against this madness. No matter what anyone says, "Be yourself, Be Individual."

1. Everyone deserves a chance to prove who they are, and everyone deserves a second chance.

2. Goths are not evil, do not always wear black, do not worship satan, are NOT evil, do not want to kill people, do not hate everybody, are not always depressed, can be happy too, are usually nice people, are normal just like YOU.

3. Stereotyping, harrasment, and discrimination should not be allowed in the society we live in.</description>
