  <description>Many people think public lands just include our National Parks. However, in all there are over 600 million acres of public lands in the U.S., which include Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land, National Wildlife Refuges and National Fish Hatcheries managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Forests and National Grasslands managed by the U.S. Forest Service, and other lands managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers.
