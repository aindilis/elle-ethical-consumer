  <description>With the support of the Inter-American Health Alliance, Primeros Pasos provides free medical and dental care, as well as health education to over five thousand patients a year in the Palajunoj Valley of Guatemala. Each day, groups for children from 12 local schools come to the clinic with their teachers to see a physician, a dentist, and to participate in health education sessions.

Primeros Pasos is an incredibly cost-effective operation and last year was able to provide clinical care to 5,425 patients and to provide an additional 493 health workshops in the Palajunoj Valley for under $23,000. 

The InterAmerican Health Alliance works with local community health organizations in Guatemala to provide financial, logistical, and technical support for cost-effective, locally-run health care programs. Our U.S.-operations are entirely volunteer-run, allowing us to provide almost 100% of funds raised directly to operations in Guatemala. 

You can also donate on a sustaining basis as part of our Five Times Five Hundred campaign, at www.fivetimesfivehundred.org. Just 500 people donating $5 a month can keep the clinic running!
