  <description>Ronnie Mitchell was my cousin... the father to Nic, Josh and Travis, son of Ron Sr. and Betty. Ronnie had Haemophilia and had several blood transfusions throughout his life.  In 1986, Ronnie discovered, around the same time Lori found out she was pregnant with Travis, that he had contracted HIV from a blood transfusion. He fought long and hard for the next 19 years. Until October 2005 when he had knee surgery... the surgery went well, but because of the HIV, his immune system was not what it used to be. Ronnie got pneumonia while still recovering in hospital and his body could no longer fight it. He died October 10th, 2005. 
 
Ronnie fought the government for many years trying to get compensation for the hundreds of people who were infected with HIV in the 80's because blood was not tested back then.
 
He was loved by so many. His infectious laugh was hard to ignore. He was always smiling, and he always had a good story or two to tell anyone who would listen. He is missed and will always be remembered by our large family, and many throughout the community.
