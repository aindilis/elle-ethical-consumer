  <description>I was looking at some other causes, and I noticed that there was no "religious equality" cause...so I decided to make one, If you agree that someone shouldn't be judged based on faith and/or personal beliefs, then you belong here.  

ALSO, if you are looking to find a faith that suits your personal beliefs, this group is also for you.

1. Create Religious Equality

2. Learn about other religions

3. Help people who are looking for a religion find one</description>
