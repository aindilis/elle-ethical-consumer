  <description>This group is designed to focus the healing power of humanity on the resources of the earth.  The earth gives us all that we need, let us honor the earth by giving back.  

Donations are great, but best is the practice of leaving a place better than you found it.  If you are an individual person this is as simple as picking up a little trash and keeping things clean.  If you represent a corporation, this would mean leaving an area where you do business, better than how you found it.  If you cannot do this because of budget restraints, then the project is not sustainable and should not be undertaken.

The power of choice is yours.  You can do as you please on this planet, but the honor of acting responsabily will give you what you seek.  

1. Caring for the earths creatures

2. Protection of mineral resources

3. Teaching responsible business practices</description>
