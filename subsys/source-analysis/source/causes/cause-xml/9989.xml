  <description>As members of this cause, we look to spread the awareness of vampyres to the mundane and often closed minds of others in the world, ultimately showing that we can be helpful within the community.  The shear fact is that others react to Vampyres the way they do based on the fact that they know nothing of who we are.  We all feel here that we can prove ourselves to others around who are not so understanding.  We wish you luck in all your campaigns and please remember to make them a peaceful ones.  Blessed be.
