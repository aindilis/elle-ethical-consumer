  <description>Homophobia is splitting our society into two groups straights and gays which isn't right. Everyone is equal and should get respect from others, but when people are discriminated against and ridiculed and in some cases physically injured because of there sexual preference and for being who they are. These acts are commited to try and make people feel ashamed of who they are and it has worked on some people. The most cases of suicide occur in gay and/or transgendered teens. Its the 21st century and times have changed, gay people aren't going to go away so it's about time people get real information and not just preconceieved notions from the media and peers and etc. This cause is to inform and end homophobia by showing support and giving real facts.
