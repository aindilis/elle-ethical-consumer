  <description>Yes we are talking about Duxbury Massachusetts here....

Yet there are many people living homeless in and around the town of Duxbury. You may not see them, but yes, they are there. Most live in desolate areas or reside in other towns, even though they are residents of Duxbury. This is due to the embarassment and harassment they would have to face if sighted in Duxbury. People in this small town may seem friendly, but can be, in fact, rather cruel to the unknown. Please, help them. They once too used to be people of prominance and wealth. They too used to ride around in their BMWs and Mercedes not knowing that one day, they would be on our streets! It can happen to anyone. One twist of fate and you could be in their shoes!

Help us help them.

Raising awareness of this situation is just the beginning.

No donations required, just your awareness.
