  <description>Chabad at the University of Delaware, an affiliate of Chabad of Delaware, is a Jewish social service organization. We provide an environment and resources for members of the University community to explore and strengthen their Jewish identity. We provide meals and services for Jewish holidays and the Sabbath. We also offer classes on Judaism in a variety of different settings and forms. 

1. Judaism should be fun and inviting

2. Everyone is connected to G-d

3. Where we find ourselves now, can always be improved</description>
