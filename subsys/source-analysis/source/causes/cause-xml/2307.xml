  <description>By joining this cause and placing it on your profile, you are taking an oath to stand your ground and Save Lebanon from being ripped to shreds by poverty, war, and let's not even begin to mention names. 
So, whoever you support, simply join me and say: "Nobody will drag me into killing my fellow countryman, my neighbour, or my brother!"

1. We believe the Lebanese have a right to live in freedom, peace and prosperity.

2. We believe that all the killings in Lebanon must end.

3. We believe that we will never carry a weapon against our fellow countrymen.</description>
