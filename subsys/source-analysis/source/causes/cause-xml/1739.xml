  <description>The average no of Units of blood per year required in Trinidad is over 65,500 and we only get 20 % of that. The investigation done into the Health Ministry also varifies this figure.

the Hindu Students Council will be embarking on a blood awareness program where we will have competitions for youth organisations, and individuals that can get the most blood donated. 

We will be also distributing alot of material on the benefits of donating blood and how easy and safe the process is.
