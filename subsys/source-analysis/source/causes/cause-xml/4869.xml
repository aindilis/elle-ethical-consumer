  <description>We provide shelter and veterinary services to each animal in our care until a permanent, committed home is found through our adoption program. We work towards alleviating animal overpopulation by ensuring that every animal handled by our organization is spayed or neutered.


1. Every animal deserves a home.

2. Animals are not disposable, temporary or a matter of convenience.</description>
