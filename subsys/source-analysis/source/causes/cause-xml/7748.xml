  <description>The GMU Chapter of MTNA has been growing more and more active and is looking for your support!

We are music students at the GMU Music Department but also teachers in our neighborhoods.  If you're a music student at GMU with students of your own, this group is for you!  State and chapter dues are small.  Contact an officer if you're interested in joining!

1. To advance the value of music study and music making to society.

2. To support the professionalism of music teachers.

3. To grow individually as strong influences in our musical community.</description>
