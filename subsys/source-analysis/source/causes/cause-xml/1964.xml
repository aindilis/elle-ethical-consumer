  <description>A worthy cause dedicated to family and friends who have no choice but to bask in the presence of the "unaware"....This is a severe wake up call to everyone because as human beings our bodies have the tendency to release an odour IF WE ARE NOT CAREFUL...so everyone please be aware and be paranoid because you do not want to be the clueless person who is making everyone else pass out..

1. We believe that deodorant is your friend.

2. If you feel slightly uncomfortable about ur "freshness", you should probably trust your instincts and take the preventive steps. 

3. Most importantly, look out for your friends, make sure you all are quick to point a stank friend to the bathroom, its pure wickedness to your friend and unfortunate passer by's to allow an "unaware" person to roam the club/streets unchecked. </description>
