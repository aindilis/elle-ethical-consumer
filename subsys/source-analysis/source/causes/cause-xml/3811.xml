  <description>Peter Armstrong used to play games with us, and then he became a father. Nothing against being a father, at all, but it sure would be nice if he joined us for some Settlers of Catan or Empire Builder a little more often!

All donations to this cause go to Mission Data International. The more money we raise the less stress Peter will have and the more inclined he'll be to get out of the house once in a while *wink*

1. Living in community is an important part of a healthy Christian lifestyle.

2. Peter needs to have more fun.

3. Our group of game players has dwindled.</description>
