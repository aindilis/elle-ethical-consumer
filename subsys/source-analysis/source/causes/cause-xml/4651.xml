  <description>Out To Pasture Farm &amp; Rescue, Inc. is a family-run 501c3 nonprofit animal rescue/rehabilitation organization that cares for animals in need. Their goal is to give these animals which are elderly, abused, terminally ill and /or physically challenged, a home where they can live out their natural lives with the physical and emotional support they deserve. This animal hospice/sanctuary is located on eleven acres in rural Connecticut.

OTP takes in dogs, cats, horses, sheep, goats, birds and more! At Out to Pasture Farm &amp; Rescue, Inc., the costs associated with the care of our special-needs animals are overwhelming. An average month costs @$5,000. A month when we take in an unusual number of sick animals can run $10,000. We take in animals from rescues that do not fund us, and we don't adopt out. OTP becomes home for our special needs animals, so we don't receive adoption fees. Therefore, our organization's success in providing the animals with the necessary specialized care they deserve depends solely on the generosity of donors like yourself.

1. All animals should be given a chance to live out their natural lives in a safe and comfortable home.

2. Terminally ill, elderly, abused, and physically disabled animals need a loving home where they can receive the care they need and deserve.</description>
