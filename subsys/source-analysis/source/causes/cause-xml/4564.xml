  <description>"The community of Nazareth Farm lives in and serves the people of Doddridge County. We are prompted to reach out to the families of Doddridge and surrounding counties with whom we minister, build relationships, and offer home repair. This service is rooted in the four cornerstones of prayer, simplicity, service and community. 

Nazareth Farm provides a communal experience of  Church as a center of action and prayer. The Nazareth Farm community lives its mission through shared prayer, meals, work, hospitality, and community development. Thus, the community strengthens through reflection, and promotes and advocates for social action and economic justice."
