  <description>If you're sick and tired of seeing that pathetic excuse of South African advertising, the Vodacom meerkat, endlessly dancing and prancing around as a symbol that stands against the interlectual level of South Africans across the globe... then stand together and join our group and put an end to them once and for all. Perhaps one day soon we can live in  world where we don't have to be visually tarnished by that moronic character... i remind you that they've just introduced a female 'playmate' for him and i fear that soon they shall have babies... please help put an end to the madness!

3. end the insanity</description>
