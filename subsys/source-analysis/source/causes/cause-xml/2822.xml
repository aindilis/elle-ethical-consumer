  <description>If you ever get the chance go to Hot Springs on Saturdays. Go to petco it is right off the bypass. Its starts at 8 and ends at whenever. Paws and Claws has created a workforce that rescues abused animals and animals in need of care. They save animals from the humane society. If they were not there the animals would be killed 3 days from when they were found. Go to love those city "officials" for the record there are over 30 animals a day that are killed due to the lack of a good home or someone to care for them. I have had 2 dogs from the paws and claws organization and they were a couple of the best I have ever had. Help them all because they can't do it on their own.

1. If you were stranded and had only 3 days until you were killed what would you wish for?

2. They need our help it takes just one to make a difference

3. Look at your pet and think of them with a syringe in their neck dying b/c no one wanted them</description>
