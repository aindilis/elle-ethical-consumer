  <description>"The mission of Students for Life of America is to: educate pro-life college students about the issues of abortion, euthanasia, and infanticide; identify pro-life student leaders; equip college pro-lifers with the training, skills and resources to be effective and successful; promote student activity to other local, college and national groups.

52% of abortions are performed on college- aged women. Students for Life of America works to make sure every campus has active pro-life outreach groups.

Since the start of our Field Program in Fall 2006, the number of campus pro-life groups has gone from 181 groups to 345 groups.

Please consider investing in Students for Life of America so that we can start even more campus pro-life groups across the nation during our Fall 2007 Field Program.
