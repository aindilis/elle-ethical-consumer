  <description>Please help save this bear. His name is Louie and he has been forced to work in a circus in Siberia for nearly all his life. He has never known any other bears, not even his mother. As you can see in the picture, he's degradation knows no end, though it goes even much further than this. All Louie wants is to rejoin the Russian Bear Calvary and be with his brothers. Please help Louie.

1. Help Louie.

2. Help Bears.

3. BEAR! BEAR!</description>
