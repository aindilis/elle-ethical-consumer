  <description>This is an organization created and run by high school and college age students. Our ultimate goal is to help spread literacy to all of Africa. We hope to establish a base in such English speaking countries as Sierra Leone,Ghana, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Botswana, and others, and eventually spread even to non English speaking countries. As we are in the early stages of starting this organization, awareness is key.If you see this group, please join it, and invite all your friends.  Eventually we will aim to raise enough money through businesses. fund raisers, and key contributors to travel to Africa, analyze the situation, and decide how exactly we can help. 

1. Every child in the world has the right to knowledge. 

2. Literacy and poverty are directly correlated, and a literate society is more likely to emerge from poverty.</description>
