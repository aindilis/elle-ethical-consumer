  <description>Save the monkeys!  There are several species of apes around the globe that are going extinct.  Scientists predict that these endangered species will not last another decade.  The goal is not only to keep these cuties alive and jumping, but also preserve their natural habitats so that our children, grandchildren, and great grand children have a chance to study them.
