  <description>&lt;b&gt;As stated above, our goal is to encourage the idea that Affirmative Action should be based on income, not race.&lt;/b&gt;

1. In general, racial minorities no longer need special help to enroll in colleges.

2. Those who are from low-income households need special help more than do those from racial minority households.

3. It is to those who need it most that affirmative action should give special help to enroll in colleges.

4. Affirmative Action should be based on income, not race.</description>
