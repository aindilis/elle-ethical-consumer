  <description>JFLL-Jamaican Foundation for Lifelong Learning could use your help!! This program is for Jamaican's that has slipped through the traditional education system and have found themselves stuck between a hard place and a rock. JfLL aka JAMAL, offers them a second chance to complete their education. The problem is they work with very little. The classrooms are inadequate, there are few books to read, and basic school supplies are expensive and are in most cases impossible to get. Things like chalk, paper, pens, pencils, dictionaries, and basic needs such as desks, chalkboards, and fans for ventilation. Each student must pay $5000.00 JA per year and this fee does not include text book fees, school supplies or uniforms. $5000.00 JA is equal to about $90.00 CAN or $85.00 US. This may sound like a small amount of money for one year of school to us, but to them that is an impossible amount of money per year. If their money was converted to our dollar, Jamaicans can make about $2.50 per hour, IF they are educated workers. Please help us raise enough money for 100 students to go to school for one year and have the school necessities that our children here have!!

1. That providing an education to those less fortunate creates a better world

2. Being able to read is a right not a privilege!!

3. Everyone deserves the same chances!!</description>
