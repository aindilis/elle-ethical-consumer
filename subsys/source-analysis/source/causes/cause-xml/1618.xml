  <description>I want money.  But I don't want to earn it.  Earning money is for suckers.  So just blindly donate money to me.  Because otherwise you're gonna just support the soulless corporations.  And corporations are evil.  And what about those gas prices?!!!

1. I like money.

2. It helps me buy things.

3. Plus, you don't need all of it.</description>
