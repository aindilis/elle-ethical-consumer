  <description>The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund was created in 1978 by Dr. Dian Fossey in order to preserve the world's last mountain gorillas.

The mountain Gorillas studied by the DFGD International live in the Virunga Volcano mountains, which spread across the borders between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda.

Poachers capture baby gorillas to sell them. The babies cannot be captured as long as adults in their family groups are alive to protect them. 

Watch "Gorillas in the Mist" (1988) with Sigourney Weaver to get an idea of how poaching works and how gruesome it is. 

Visit www.gorillafund.org in order to learn more about DFGD, what they are doing to stop the killing, and what you can do in order to support them in their journey to save the gorillas from extinction.

There are two ways to donate:
1. Through this cause, in which case the Fund will receive a collection of all donations at the end of the month. Or

2. By directly visiting the Fund's website (mentioned above), in which case you will be recognized as a donor and will receive a Thank You in the mail as well as a newsletter subscription for one year (consisting of 4 issues).

The choice is yours. Thank you for your concern and help.

1. Spread the word. 

2. Stop poachers.

3. Involve people to support and save the gorillas before it is too late.</description>
