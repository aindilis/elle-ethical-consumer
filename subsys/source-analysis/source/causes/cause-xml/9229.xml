  <description>Simply put, Burrito Project is a group of people that want to hang out, make burritos, and deliver them to homeless people in the downtown indianapolis area. We're not looking for fame. We dont want to be recognized by the press. Hell - theres not even a leader to the burrito project. We do it to have fun and help out our communtiy by feeding those in need. If you really want to help us, you can by donating goods such as tortillas, beans, rice, aluminum foil, papertowels, or even your house so we can make some burritos. You can also help by actually making the burritos, or handing them out with us. 

We plan to hand out burrito's once per month.

In order to do it, we need &lt;big&gt; you! &lt;normal&gt; please donate and helpus get this going!!!!

Burrito Project Statement from there Myspace:
The mission of Burrito Project is to provide people with the means to become active members in their community. It is a way for people to bridge a gap between the fed and the hungry.  Burrito Project is in no way shape or form affiliated with any religious or political organization; we are non-fame and a non-personal recognition group . There is no Burrito Project head quarters or leader nor a need for one.

The Project is simply providing a tool to show how fun, easy, inexpensive, and rewarding feeding hungry people can be. 

Respect,
