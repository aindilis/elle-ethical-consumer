  <description>Back2Back Mexico exists to serve the abandoned and neglected children of Monterrey, Mexico. By connecting mission groups from the United States with children's homes in Mexico, Back2Back is able to meet the physical needs of the children while serving them spiritually as well. Back2Back has grown to support nearly 400 children in seven separate children's homes, 19 teens in the Joshua and Esther House programs: 13 students at the high school level and 6 students at the college level. Additionally, nearly 4,000 American youths and adults have been able to strengthen their relationships with God by visiting Back2Back Mexico's facilities and by working on mission teams to support the organization's cause. Through these partnerships, Back2Back is able to provide "care for today and hope for tomorrow" to the children of Monterrey, Mexico.  

Back2Back Mexico Vision:  That we would reach every child God brings into our path by meeting their personal needs, developing a long-term relationship with them, and by supporting their spiritual growth that they may establish a personal relationship with the Lord.
