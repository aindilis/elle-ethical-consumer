  <description>Our mission is to help the families of Miguel Aleman rise from poverty.  After a summer mission in this small Mexican community, the volunteers were shocked to see the living standards and poverty just south of our border.  We have created the organizatoin of MAKE A difference to help these struggling people and help them and their children to see a brighter future. 

1. Families must have proper shelter 

2. Necessary clothing, food, and essentials must be available

3. Children must recieve proper tools for education</description>
