  <description>"Dad's Against Drunk Driving".  We already know about MADD, so here's DADD.  The thought of an idiot killing my children for the sake of tying one on makes my heart cringe.  My children are the most precious thing in my life, and being a Dad of three I can tell you that the way a Mother would mourn the loss of her child is no less than mine.  Don't drink and drive and don't let others.  It could be your child or you.
