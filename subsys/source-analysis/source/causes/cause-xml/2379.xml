  <description>Venezuela is in desperate need to gain peace and liberty. RCTV (Radio Caracas Television) was closed after over 53 years of airing. The goverment has taken control and goverment is no democracy. Lets help the people gain the land they once had without becoming the next cuba. Ni un paso atras, y como RCTV dice "Un amigo es para siempre", y para eso estamos! Y seguro que luego ayudaremos a Ecuador y mas.

1. Liberty and Peace is needed for the people.

2. The Voice of the people isn't being heard.</description>
