  <description>It's really kinda simple. If you wanna be single, be single. If you're in a relationship, be in the relationship! It doesn't make sense to cheat, because at the end of the day you have to think, WAS IT REALLY WORTH IT??? 



1. True love is able to conquer all things

2. Stop the breaking of hearts

3. If it isn't working, tell the person. DON'T CHEAT!!!</description>
