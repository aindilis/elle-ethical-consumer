  <description>MND is a terrible disease that affects many people worldwide - I know this disease first hand as my father suffered for 3 years before passing away.

MND associations do great work and offer support and equipment to people who desperately need it. 

I urge you to learn more about MND and support the association by being part of MND awareness week every year usually held in March.

MND is known by many names in different countries, as facebook only allows US beneficiaries I have chosen Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association which is based in the US.

MND is also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.

I would like this page to also be dedicated to all the families and friends who are left behind. It is a place you can be free to tell your stories and know those who read it care and understand.

Visit the local MND site in your area. NSW site is www.mndnsw.asn.au but each state and country will have their own site. Please visit the sites and learn more about the disease and if you are able to help in any way I'm sure it will be greatly appreciated by those suffering from MND.
