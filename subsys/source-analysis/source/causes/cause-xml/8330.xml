  <description>This is a petition based cause, your name is only required.  This cause is to send a message to the Government of Canada, to create the Cannabis Control Board, (CCB).  Which, similar to the Liquor Control Board, would be responsible for the control and distribution of marijuana.  The benefits of legalization is well known, so please send the government your message.

1. End the cannabis prohibition.</description>
