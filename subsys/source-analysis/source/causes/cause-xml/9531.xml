  <description>Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate is the most common birth defect in the United States right now affecting one in 700 babies. The cause of it is unknown and although it is a very fixable defect, most families going through the process feel as though they are alone in their struggle.
When more people accept and acknowledge cleft lip as something that happens, the sooner more people will talk about it openly and hopefully find the cause of it so it can be prevented. The "cleft kids" of America are lucky enough to have the resources and doctors at their disposal, in other countries across the world most cleft lips and palates are never corrected. Let us use this group to open discussion amongst ourselves and our peers to educate each other about a very common occurence in childbirth today!
