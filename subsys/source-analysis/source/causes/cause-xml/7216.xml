The Mspca is having their annual WALK FOR ANIMALS.

I have started a team. You do not have to join the team but any and all donations would be greatly appreciated.

This money goes to saving the lives of animals that enrich our lives every day.

These animals deserve a second chance and by donating, you can give them that second chance.

We aim to raise atleast $500 .

Please help the cause!!!

1. To save the lives of innocent animals

2. To honor those animals that have been saved

3. To give back</description>
