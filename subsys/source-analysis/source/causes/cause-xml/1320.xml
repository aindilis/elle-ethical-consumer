  <description>Resolve Uganda is the combined effort of individuals and organizations concerned about the children caught in the crossfire of the LRA's war and who want to bring an end to the crisis. By acting together, we can make sure our concerns are heard in Washington DC and that our leaders are doing all they can to end the war.

1. The two-decade crisis has left million of kids caught in the cross-fire of a brutal war.

2. U.S. engagement is needed to help them and bring peace.

3. Getting U.S. leadership on this issue requires concern and action from people like you.</description>
