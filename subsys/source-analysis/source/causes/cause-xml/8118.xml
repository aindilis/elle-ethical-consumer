  <description>The object of this Facebook Cause is to persuade Democratic candidates everywhere - up and down the ticket - as well as progressive movement organizations like the Center for Progressive Leadership, Progressive Majority and Democracy for America, to engage in a vigorous debate about governing philosophy.

The philosophy of conservatism has brought our great country nearly to ruin. In ten years, conservatism will be dead the way communism is dead. It's time to replace it with something better.

Our first project will be to persuade the Dem presidential candidates to address this at the YearlyKos Leadership Forum.

Democrats, vision up! Also, if anyone wants to donate, the moo-lah goes to US Action, a great group doing voter education &amp; GOTV with a focus on underrepresented demographics.

1. "Ideas have consequences"... do they ever.

2. The United States needs a new governing philosophy.

3. Strong, clearly expressed ideas will be the foundation of the progressive movement.</description>
