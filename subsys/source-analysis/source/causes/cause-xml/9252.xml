  <description>It's sickening how pedophiles can be released from prison.  Pedophilia is a mental illness and is never cured, so when a pedophile is released after their sentence their bound to commit their sickening fantasies again. My point is to raise awarness, and be on the lookout for for unusual behavior, or an adult approaching a young child that doesn't seem to be with him/her, and say something..it could never hurt right?

1. Sentences on Pedophiles should be harsher &amp; firmer</description>
