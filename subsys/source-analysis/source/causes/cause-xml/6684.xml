  <description>Did you Know: If one in four people rode their bike at least 5 kilometers a week, we can reduc 6.7 Million Tons of Carbon Dioxide that is released into our atmosphere. 

We need the resources to keep the sport and leisure activity alive! In some areas it is not even recognized as a leisure activity let alone a sport. Bikes are banned from trails and other areas such as skate parks. We need more trails and places to ride!
