  <description>What is A Rare Disorder?
A rare or "orphan" disease affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. There are more than 6,000 rare disorders that, taken together, affect approximately 25 million Americans. One in every 10 individuals in this country has received a diagnosis of a rare disease.&#185;
Central Nervous System Vasculitis is one of those RARE diseases that fall under the umbrella of the National Organization of Rare Diseases (NORD).

What Is Central Nervous System Vasculitis (CNSV)?
CNSV is the inflammation of the Central Nervous System; affecting the blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord. Diagnosing CNSV is a clinical challenge because it is a syndrome, not a specific disease; and can be easily misdiagnosed as Lupus and/or Multiple Sclerosis, or any number of other diseases.
