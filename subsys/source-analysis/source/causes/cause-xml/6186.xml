  <description>The SAMFund is a unique 501c3 nonprofit organization designed to assist survivors of cancer between 17 and 35 with the financial challenges they face after finishing treatment.  Our grants and scholarships cover a wide range of "real life" needs, including (but not limited to) rent, tuition and loans, car and health insurance, residual medical bills and fertility-related expenses.  To date, we have awarded a total of $500,000 to more than 250 young adult survivors across the country.  Please check out our website, www.thesamfund.org, for their stories!

1. Being a young adult in today's economy is TOUGH.

2. Young adult survivors face the same expenses as everyone else - rent, tuition, gym, groceries, etc - plus thousands in medical bills and co-pays.

3. The SAMFund is the only organization in the country that provides financial assistance for these post-treatment, "real life" needs.

4. To date, we have awarded a total of $600K to hundreds of YA survivors across the country.</description>
