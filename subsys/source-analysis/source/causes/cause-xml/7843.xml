  <description>Join this cause if you are in support of a National Health Care Program in the United States. The current health care system is unethical and needs reform.  Profits are being placed over the care of people, the true mission of healthcare.  If you have not seen the new movie Sicko, I strongly encourage you to.  Know that your support will help countless numbers of people in America who are suffering and dying everyday because they do not have access to adequate medical care.
