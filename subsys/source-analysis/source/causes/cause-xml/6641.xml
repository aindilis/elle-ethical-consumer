  <description>Thrive Africa&#8217;s heart is to disciple Believers, equip leaders, and strengthen the Church in Southern Africa. We accomplish this through AIDS prevention, pastoral development, discipleship classes, youth camps, mission trips, and internship programs.

1. The AIDS pandemic will only be stopped by training the next generation to live Godly, moral lives.

2. Leadership is paramount. We want to launch Godly African leaders into all realms of society. 

3. We all have a part to play in bringing in the global harvest.

4. Glorifying God is our highest aim.</description>
  <mission>To equip and mobilize indigenous leaders to become strategic, Godly influences in their cultural communities. </mission>
