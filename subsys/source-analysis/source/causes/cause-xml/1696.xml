  <description>I'm running a marathon on December 02, 2007 on behalf of the training program to benefit the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. I train four days a week for the next six months and need to raise $3000.  If you can, please contribute to my fundraising goal (any amount is better than no amount).

Contribute here to my marathon fund: http://aidsmarathon.org/participant.asp?runner=SF-5133&amp;EventCode=LV07

I'm keeping a blog to update my marathoning progress at:
