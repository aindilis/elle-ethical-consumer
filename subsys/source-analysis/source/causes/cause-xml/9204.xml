  <description>Dance for Peace: One Step at a Time, is a cultural exchange program that uses urban dance to elevate underprivileged aspiring dancers across the globe. Our organization sends teams of dance teachers and performers to students living in countries recovering from civil conflict. These teachers facilitate workshops in various urban dance styles to children and young adults who don't have the resources to pursue their dreams. Working together and learning about dance, the students improve their self-esteem, learn to solve problems and share in each others creativity regardless of their differences. The students learn to work as a team in order to create a performance to be presented to the public at the end of the festival. Upon the conclusion of the festival, 6-8 of the programs most promising students will be given the Career Advancement Scholarship Training award (CAST). CAST will enable these students to further their training in New York and Philadelphia for three weeks over the summer. Dance for Peace is currently facilitating festivals in Cape Town, South Africa and Lima, Peru with future projects planned for Uganda, Brazil and the Philippines.
