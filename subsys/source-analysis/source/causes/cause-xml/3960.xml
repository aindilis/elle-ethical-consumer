  <description>On June 5, 1981, the first cases of AIDS were diagnosed. Now, 25 years later HIV and AIDS still exist in our community. Each year, there are approximately 40,000 new HIV infections in the United States. It's estimated that more than 1 million people in the United States are HIV positive, though 1 in 4 don't know it.

Colorado AIDS Project (CAP) was founded in 1983 as the first community-wide response to the HIV/AIDS crisis that was devastating the Denver metro area. Today, CAP continues as the largest community based organization responding to the ongoing HIV/AIDS crisis in Colorado by offering vital services through the CAP Wellness Resource Center (WRC), Housing Services Center (HSC), and the Prevention and Education Center (PEC).
