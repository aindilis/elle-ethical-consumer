  <description>Leukemia is a malignant disease (cancer) of the bone marrow and blood. It is characterized by the uncontrolled accumulation of blood cells. Leukemia is divided into four categories: myelogenous or lymphocytic, each of which can be acute or chronic.

Incidence rates by age differ for each of the leukemias. The leukemias represented 26 percent of all cancers occurring among children younger than 20 years from 2000-2003. In the 17 SEER areas of the United States, there were 2,847 children under the age of 20 diagnosed with leukemia from 2001-2003, including 2,130 with ALL.  From these data, it is estimated that in 2006, 3,442 children will be diagnosed with leukemia throughout the United States. About 2,388 new cases of childhood ALL are expected to occur in 2006.

- The most common form of leukemia among children under 19 years of age is ALL. The incidence of ALL among 1- to 4-year-old children is more than 9 times greater than the rate for young adults ages 20-24.
