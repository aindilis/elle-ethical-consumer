  <description>I am traveling to Dehli, India September 19th to work in an orphanage, founded and run by Adventures in Missions-the organization I'm traveling with.  I will primarily be working with the children in the orphanage, but I will also be visiting and working in leper colonies and slums.  
I need to raise $5,000 to cover all costs including tickets to Atlanta, GA for a week-long training camp, so I would appreciate any small amount you would be willing to donate!  :)
