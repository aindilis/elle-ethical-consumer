  <description>Incandescent bulbs account for the majority of ligh bulbs sold in the United States. They are inefficient and are a major factor in the global warming trend. Lets all move to Compact Flourescent Bulbs and help make a brighter future for our world.

1. Energy saved over the lifetime of one 24-watt compact fluorescent bulb is sufficient to drive a Prius from New York to San Francisco

2. The bulb switch would facilitate shutting down 80 coal-fired plants.

3. Switching light bulbs is an easy way of realizing large immediate gains in energy efficiency.</description>
