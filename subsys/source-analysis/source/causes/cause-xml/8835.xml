  <description>A neighborhood association since 1991, NATHA began as a Neighborhood Watch group in the low-income Lincoln Corridor of Northwest Pasadena.  The Navarro Avenue Tremont Howard Association quickly outgrew its original charter and boundaries.  Its current name keeps the original acronym, but better reflects its mission through two programs, Youth Development and Community Development.
NATHA&#8217;s success at bringing people together to work toward their shared vision has increased its outreach to about 1900 households. Rather than re-invent the wheel, NATHA maintains strong partnerships with public and private agencies to achieve the community&#8217;s goals. Its focus is not agency growth but community priorities consistent with the organization&#8217;s vision. Its excellence derives from low-cost solutions that are widely embraced.
