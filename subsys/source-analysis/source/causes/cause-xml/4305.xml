  <description>It's all well and good to get hot and bothered about the environment or poverty. But how much do we care about the people around us? Like the person sitting next to you on the bus or the person you're buying chai from? We can't change the world until we change ourselves. So lets try and spread the good karma around. Peace and love starts within.

1. What goes around comes around. Think about what you're sending out.

2. Would you have done unto you what youre doing unto others?

3. Smile. Its a way to make people feel a little better about themselves.

4. If you have a choice between being nice to someone and being mean to someone, try nice.

5. Messing around with people to get your way works out in the short run. Helping people out works in the long run. 

6. If you have a chance to help someone, take it. </description>
