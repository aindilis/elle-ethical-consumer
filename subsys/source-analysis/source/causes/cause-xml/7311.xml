  <description>Relay For Life is the American Cancer Society's signature event. Relay represents the hope that those lost to cancer will never be forgotten, that those who face cancer will be supported, and that one day, cancer will be eliminated.

This is a walk for a cure. Every dollar raised is money used in research, education, service, and advocacy in order to find a cure for cancer and to support services for cancer victims.
