  <description>There are a lot of problems in America today.  Our health care system is failing, our schools are not getting the job done, the immigration debate rages on with no action and it is hard to get through a week without hearing a tale of corruption in the White House or in Congress.  Some say it is the fault of the Republicans while others blame the Democrats.  When trying to assess blame, however, the smart money is on apathy.  For the most part, Americans don't care what is going on in Washington, DC.  They don't understand how it affects their lives and they certainly don't feel they are capable of changing what goes on inside the beltway.  

However, The Close Up Foundation believes that nothing could be further from the truth.  People can and must engage the policy makers and hold them accountable.  The Close Up Foundation strives to teach citizenship and leadership skills to high school and middle school students and to show them their stake, and their role, in the political process.

1. It is the responsibility of all citizens to engage policymakers.

2. Young people can and must be a part of the political process.

3. The more voices and viewpoints that enter into the American market place of ideas, the better.</description>
