  <description>New England Frontier Camp is an inter-denominational independent Christian organization, located in southwestern Maine on beautiful Kezar Lake.  Since 1965 we have offered outstanding, life changing, adventure camping for boys and young men.

We offer summer programs for campers ages 6-18, Labor Day weekend Family Camp, as well as retreat facilities for groups in the Fall, Winter and Spring.

Campers will be under the guidance of trained and caring counselors during their stay at New England Frontier Camp.  It is our desire to provide your son with a camping experience that is exciting, memorable, fun and most importantly, life changing as a result of an increased awareness and knowledge of God.  



1. To encourage and invite campers to examine the life and teachings of Jesus, mentoring them in making positive choices about lifestyles and their future.

2. To nurture healthy and encouraging relationships with others.

3. To strive for a safe environment where risk is minimized.</description>
