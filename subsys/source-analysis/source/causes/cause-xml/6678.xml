  <description>It is our belief that the state is distinct from religion, and it is not the responsibility of the state to enforce religion, instead, religion is a personal issue for every citizen.

Although Pakistan consists of a Muslim majority, the consumption of alcohol by Muslims should be legalized as the right to choose rests with each individual. 

The state must not prosecute individuals for consuming alcohol in the privacy of their own home, instead, they should only be concerned with prosecuting those who harm others in the state of intoxication, e.g. disorderly conduct, domestic violence, driving under the influence.

1. Purchase and consumption of alcohol by Muslims should be legalized

2. Separation of state and religion</description>
