  <description>Here's what people say about AbidingRadio: 

"I just recently 'ran across' your Abiding Radio internet radio, and want to let you know that I really like it!  I like that you don't have a disc jockey or radio broadcaster talking all the time.  I like the music selections you make.  I like that you have mostly music.  I like it....!  May the Lord bless you, and keep up the great job." Tim

"I just wanted to let you know that Abiding Radio has been an incredible encouragement to me this week.  I've had a really hard week, and the Christ-centered music has helped me to focus my mind on the Lord, as I listen via the internet at work.  I plan to send a donation to help you soon.  Thank you again!!" Sarah

"I have been listening to your site for the last 3 days, for around 20 hours!  It is absolutely great!! Good Conservative Christian music, for us all to enjoy. I have been sending your site link, to all my friends (100++) And have been getting heaps of great feedback!! Congrats, keep it up! :)" Joash in Australia
