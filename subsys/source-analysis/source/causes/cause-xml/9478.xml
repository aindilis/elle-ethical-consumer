  <description>The Elgin Street Mission is an organization that has served the needs of the homeless in sudbury since 1989. Our beinnings as a drop-in cente quicliky evolved into what is now a service facility that serves over 50,000 meals a year. We offer a host of other services that were put in place, according to recognized needs, in order to accomplish and compliment our "mission statement".

1. we seek to help people in every way we can

2. to work with real people and not mere programs

3. to treat others the way we would like to be treated if we needed help.

4. to keep our focus clear</description>
