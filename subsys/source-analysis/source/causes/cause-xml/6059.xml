  <description>We believe that Taco Bell should be commended on the tremendous work it has done in the name of puppy rights.  We also heart the crunchwrap.  Viva gorditas!

1. Taco Bell must remain tasty and helpful to puppies.

2. Puppies must remain cute and innocent enough to warrent the support of such a great restaurant chain.

3. The Smiths must reunite.</description>
