  <description>E The People is a public forum for democratic and deliberative discussion. The conversations on E The People explore the political issues we see in the news, rejecting the traditional spin and conventional wisdom that tends to fill the airwaves. We have built E The People in a way that allows members to have maximum control over the topics and frames for discussion; it's our attempt at a citizen-driven town hall.
