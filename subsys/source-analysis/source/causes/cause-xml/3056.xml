  <description>I have a kidney disease that has put me on dialysis.  I had to have both kidneys removed.  I would love to visit my family but the cost of traveling while on dialysis is more than I can afford.  This cause is also for the awareness of kidney disease.Thank you.

Also if any donations are made they will help people with kidney disease.

PS- If you would like to donate any money to Pamela directly contact her at Pamela_pp@hotmail.com
Thanks
