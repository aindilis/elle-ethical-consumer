  <description>Living Hope International, Incorporated is a non-profit organization whose goal is to give Chinese orphans a future, a hope and the opportunity to grow up in a warm, loving environment.  We want to equip them to become caring adults who are willing and able to inspire the same hope in their fellow man.

As an organization, we use monetary donations to pay for food, clothing, medical attention and educational supplies for the children in our care. We also use designated funds to construct new orphanages. Additional monies are used to pay for Chinese staff salaries, transportation costs for the children, building maintenance and fuel to heat the buildings where the children live.  We welcome the opportunity to partner with individuals, families and business people who are willing to make a difference in the lives of so many children who need our help.
