  <description>Many kids go through serious illnesses; one of the worst being Cancer. 
All donations go directly to the CCA to help support our mission of keeping kids happy and helping them fight and beat Cancer. There's endless possibilities to what we can accomplish together!

My short term goal is for us to have $1000 raised and donated. Then when we reach that mark, our next goal is to be $10000. And so on! The sky's the limit!

1. Children should not have to suffer alone with Cancer.

2. Cancer can be fought!

3. Cancer can be beaten!</description>
