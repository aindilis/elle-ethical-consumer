  <description>Great Commission Air was founded by Robert
Robert and Jennifer Rice in 2000. Jennifer and Robert have a heart for God's people and believe that spreading the Gospel and showing love for all people truly is the Great Commission. They feel compelled to promote the spread of the Gospel and have tremendous respect and admiration for those that work hard, everyday, to reach the people who have not heard the good news. Their desire to provide aviation support to missionaries and humanitarian relief to the people in underdeveloped areas led them to found Great Commission Air.

1. Guatemalans in remote villages need access to health care, which can often only be accessed by plane 

2. Missionaries in these areas also benefit from air support, as it allows them to reach far many more people</description>
