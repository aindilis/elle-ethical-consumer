Since 1982 nine Israeli soldiers have been taken captive.

All of these men are known to have been captured alive; and since there capture, a steady flow of information has been leaked to suggest that they are still alive, and being held captive in Syria and Iran. Despite the diplomatic and military efforts of successive Israeli governments, almost no progress has been made in determining the fate of these missing fathers, sons and husbands.
