  <description>Researchers have developed a mouse with Down Syndrome. This mouse is unraveling the mysteries and changing the landscape of genetic research in Down Syndrome.

The extra genes of the 21st chromosome have been mapped. The most crucial genes have been identified. Drugs to stop the expression need to be identified and carefully tested on DS mice.

Why hasn't it been done? .......

......not enough  MICE!

By adopting 1 mouse today, you will ensure continued research
