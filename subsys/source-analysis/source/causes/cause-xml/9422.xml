  <description>There is a greater chance that you or a loved one will need an organ transplant than there is of you becoming an organ donor. Organ donation in Canada remains static at about 14 donors for every million people. This is less than other countries such as Portugal, the United States, and Spain which range from 20 to 32 donors for every million people.

WHAT CAN BE DONATED?
The heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, kidneys and intestines are organs that can be donated. Skin, bones, veins, soft tissues, heart valves, corneas and eyes are tissues that can be donated. One donor often saves more than one life. 

BECOME A DONOR
Talk to your family about your wishes. Sign an organ and tissue donor card in the presence of a witness. (The back of your Alberta Health Care Card is a donor card.)
If you are already a donor, please help raise awareness - spread the word about the gift of organ and tissue donation.
