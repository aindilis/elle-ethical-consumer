  <description>HUNGER, HUMANITY'S OLDEST ENEMY

Since 2000, the total number of undernourished people worldwide had risen to 852 million: 815 in developing countries, 28 million in countries in transition and nine million in industrialised countries.

When hunger strikes a community, children suffer most. Hunger drains them of their will and ability to learn. 

There are approximately 400 million children chronically hungry children in the world. One hundred million of them do not attend school, and two thirds of those not attending school are girls.

Our planet produces enough food for every man, woman , and child to live healthy productive lives. Yet, every five seconds a child dies of hunger.

By supporting WFP, The World Food Program, you will help fighting poverty and hunger, and provide the necessary food and funds to those who need it the most, areas like: West Africa, Darfur, Southern Africa... and much more.
