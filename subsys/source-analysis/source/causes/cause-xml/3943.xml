  <description>It is estimated that one in twenty babies in India is abandoned for social or economic reasons. There are currently 32 million destitute children in India, many of whom suffer from poor health as a result of neglect and poverty. Something as simple as a cavity can cause infection, extreme pain, and eventual death. At Healthy Smiles we believe a little prevention goes a long way, and that is why we will be delivering 1,000 dental care packages to the Mother Teresa Missionary of Charity in India this February.
