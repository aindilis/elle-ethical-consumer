  <description>We are a grassroots humanitarian organization ran out of a small residential kitchen in Lawrenceville, GA.  Our group is youth-based, and we'd like to keep it that way for a number of reasons. We recognize that the feed-and-leave "solution" and the just-ignore-it anti-solution aren't going to solve the problem of homelessness. We want to get involved with the lives of homeless people. We want to humanize them, help them, and finally hold them to something bigger for themselves. We refuse to think that people are "lost causes" because they have mental illnesses or have just screwed up in the past. We have a long way to go, but that's where you come in.
