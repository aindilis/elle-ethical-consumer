  <description>We are of the firm opinion that divorce should be an option only in cases of adultery or patterns of physical abuse, either of which must be proven in a court of law prior to the granting of any divorce.

1. Marriage is a permanent relationship appreciated by those inside the union as well as outside.

2. Currently laws governing marriage do not sufficiently appreciate the institution of marriage.</description>
