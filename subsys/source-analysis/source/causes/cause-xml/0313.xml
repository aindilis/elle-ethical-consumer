  <description>What is sarcoma?

Sarcoma is a very rare and deadly form of cancer that affects the connective tissue of the body.  Because of its rarity, sarcoma research receives very little funding.  Sadly, approximately 9,700 people are diagnosed each year with sarcoma and 15% of all children diagnosed with cancer are fighting a form of sarcoma. 

In the United States today, there are nearly 50,000 people battling the disease and 3,500 people will die this year of soft tissue sarcomas.



1. Sarcoma Research: Approximately 60% of funds raised by the JHYSF are used for sarcoma research (including 13 new drug trials) at MGH.

2. Sarcoma Education Network: 20% of the funds provide approximately 120 patients and families with valuable resources.

3. Sarcoma Family Support:  20% of the funds allow family members to stay with patients as they undergo treatment.</description>
