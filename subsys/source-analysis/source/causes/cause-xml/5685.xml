Instant Karma is Amnesty International's new campaign using  the power of John Lennon's music and the voices of millions of concerned people around the world to stop the horrific human rights abuses taking place in Darfur, Sudan.

More than 50 top musicians &#8211; Green Day, Avril Lavigne, U2, R.E.M. and many others &#8211; have made original recordings of John Lennon&#8217;s songs. 

Get the INSTANT KARMA 2 CD album on iTunes or from online music stores.

A portion of revenue from INSTANT KARMA music downloads and CD sales will directly support Amnesty International&#8217;s human rights work. 

Amnesty thanks Yoko Ono, who generously granted rights to Lennon&#8217;s entire solo songbook to Amnesty International.
