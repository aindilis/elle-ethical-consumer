  <description>In a decision handed down by the Antioch board of trustees, Antioch College is to close its doors July 1st 2008. If we are loud, noisy, and in-your-face enough about this travesty we have the power to set things right. Be loud, be angry, do not forget what this college means to the people who work for it, attend it, and the alumni who have fond memories of it.
Be aware this mandate is a product of the board without faculty, student, alumni, or any college representative, with the exception of the President, who had his proposal practically ignored, and completely unconsidered. It is not a plan to "update" our school. It is a plan to sweep a distraction from the universities under the rug, not  for the next four years, but for good.
Don't let our school disapear. Don't let the proud history of Antioch students being outspoken and irrepressable die in 2008.
Fight this. For the sake of all that Antioch represents. Fight this.

1. Antioch College should stay open.

2. The people who work for, and go to, the college are good people.

3. We can fight this, and stop it.</description>
