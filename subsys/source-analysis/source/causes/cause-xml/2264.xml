Shoot For A Cure Curling is a campaign of the Canadian and American Spinal Research Organizations that solicits support of the curling community to raise spinal cord injury awareness, prevention, research and cure. Our goal is to raise money for spinal cord research from the able-bodied curling market and to raise funds and awareness to endorse the relatively new sport of wheelchair curling. Through the promotion of wheelchair curling within the SCI community in Canada, we encourage a healthier way of living and improvement of overall quality of living for people with a spinal cord injury.

Shoot For A Cure Moto-Sport is an innovative program from the American and Canadian Spinal Research Organizations (ASRO/CSRO). It partners with the automotive and moto-sport industry to raise awareness about the importance of safe driving in order to reduce the incidence of spinal cord injuries due to motor vehicle crashes. Shoot For A Cure Moto-Sport also raises funds for spinal cord injury research that seeks to cure paralysis and improve the quality of life for those living with spinal cord injuries.
