  <description>The left-wing is screwing up today's society.  The Liberal media pollutes the minds of every citizen of America.

This cause is not to accumulate money for any organization, but to raise awareness of the lies from the left-wing and exploit the unpatriotic nature of the Liberal party.

The goal of this cause is to awaken the common sense of the average American and aid them to realize the the Liberal party is full of shit.

To pledge to this cause is to pledge to defend the core conservative beliefs and to call out an ignorant Liberal's claim, refute their claim, and demolish their claim in the process.
