  <description>The definitions of tolerance and acceptance have been confused. Acceptance means to look favorably upon and possibly participate in. To tolerate means to allow, have a permissive attitude towards. It is vital to Christianity and its mission to be tolerant towards those with different beliefs and thoughts in order to acheive the task set before us. Jesus Christ was the most tolerant person to ever walk upon this earth, and it is time for His followers to take up the cross and tolerate our neighbors just as our Lord taught us to. 

1. Instead of fighting for the Ten Commandments to stay inside of government buildings we must focus our energy on social injustice.

2. We must extend the Gospel to those of different sexualities, nationalities, political agendas, and religions in a tolerant and loving manner.</description>
