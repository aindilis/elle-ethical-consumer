  <description>Speeding causes a lot of accidents whether you're in a parking lot or on the freeway. It might seem  harmless but it can trigger a chain effect that can cause accidents and deaths.

Lets all drive at the speed of regular traffic and promote safety on the roads.

1. Stop speeding, save lives.

2. Speeding is not worth more than someone's life.</description>
