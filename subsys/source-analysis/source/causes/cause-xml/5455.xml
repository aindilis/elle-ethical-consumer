  <description>We provide three programs in which to help our clients: 

A)Self Advocacy Center. It is here that those in need can find case management, clothing, email, food, state-wide phone calls, showers, storage, and a personal voicemail service. Furthermore, a doctor provides general medical care and referrals once a week. We serve an average of 70 clients a day. 

B)Sunday Meal Program. During the entire year, on every Sunday, volunteers from every part of the community help us serve a nutritious home-cooked meal. We have missed only one meal in 16 years. We serve an average of 80 clients each Sunday. 

C)Clothing Program. We provide free clothing at both our Self-Advocacy Center and our Sunday Meal Program. We serve an average of 10 clients a day.
