  <description>My funding for college was cut on 19 July 2007 with just 4 weeks left till i leave for college. Now I need to raise $21500. Please help by praying for me. Please pass on this cause, the more that pray the better.

I will be studding theology. I wold rather not have to go to America to study it, but because of liberal agendas of the universities means that I can not get a good sold education in theology here.

Thank you and may God bless you.

A priest friend of mine is calling agroup who apparently has a lot of money. Pray that conversation goes well, and they are wiling to fund the rest of my tuition. Our Lord reigns.
