  <description>I am being sent to Guerin Catholic High School against my will.  I hope that these sorts of things can be prevented in the future.

1. forced school transfers need to  be ended in consideration of the student  and thier friends

2. Students should not have to pay to go to a high school they don't even want to go to.</description>
  <mission>let students choose if they don't want to go to a stupid private school or catholic school.</mission>
  <name>Unfair requirement for students to go to schools they dont want to go to</name>
