  <description>The Criminal Justice Policy Coalition (CJPC) is a member-based, non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of effective, just, and humane criminal justice policy in Massachusetts. We seek to accomplish this by expanding the public discourse on criminal justice, promoting dialogue and cooperation among diverse stakeholders, and building support for policies that better protect our communities, promote accountability and change for offenders, and provide restitution to victims. We hold occasional networking meetings on a variety of criminal justice issues, sponsor public forums and conferences, organize legislative action, and provide support and coordination to groups engaged in advocacy.

1. Prisons should be reserved for only the most serious crimes. 

2. Mandatory minimum sentences should be eliminated

3. Prisons should be administered not to inflict additional punishment, but to provide a safe, humane environment, to preserve family ties and prepare prisoners to return to society.

4. Drug addiction is more effectively addressed as a health, rather than a criminal problem.

5. The death penalty has no place in society.</description>
