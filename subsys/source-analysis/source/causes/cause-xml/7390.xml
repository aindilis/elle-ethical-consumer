  <description>While there is no secret formula for a successful marriage, love and commitment remain essential ingredients. And government does its part, too, by providing hundreds of protections to help families get through difficult times. Visit http://www.10Couples.org and meet ten committed couples who are sharing their lives and building families together. Watch their videos and learn what you can do to ensure that these ordinary couples are no longer denied important protections for their families.

After viewing the videos, use the "Tell Your Friends" feature to send others a link to http://www.10Couples.org. Talking with your friends, family, neighbors and classmates about why denying marriage for same-sex couples is wrong is the single best way we have to get people to start changing the way they think about the issue.
