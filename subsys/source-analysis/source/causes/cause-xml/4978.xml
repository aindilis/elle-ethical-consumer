  <description>I think that at 12 years old a person knows what is right or wrong.They should pay the price for their crime.To get 3 years for murder is rediculous.They should be getting life as an adult.YOU DO THE CRIME YOU DO THE TIME EVEN IF IT WAS ONE OF MINE I WOULD STILL LOVE THEM BUT I WOULD FEEL THE SAME WAY. Lets stop all the drive bys and stabbings .Just lets stop all the crime with getting rid of the young offenders act PLEASE.
