  <description>The FCAT is the doom of all of our future generations. Being forced to take this test is ruining all of our lives.


1. teachers take time out of their curriculum to teach their students skills they should have learned in elementary school in order to pass.

2. teachers are using this time when they should be teaching their students what they need to succeed in the real world.

3. some great students are not good test takers so if they fail the FCAT they are FORCED to take REMEDIAL classes that tell them that they aren't good enough.

4. all the FCAT measures is a school's quality in test taking skills and how much funding it should get in the next budget. schools should not be measured because of a standardized test.</description>
