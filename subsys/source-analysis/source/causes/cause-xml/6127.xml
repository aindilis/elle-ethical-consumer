  <description>As the interest in Jazz diminishes, so too does the funding for Jazz radio stations, Jazz clubs and other organizations. Showing interest and making donations to the cause will help to keep Jazz alive and strong for the people who enjoy it.

Users are also encouraged to donate, or download the stream of Jazz FM.91, a Toronto based Jazz station with excellent standards.

Download and even donate at

1. People who enjoy the genre should always be allowed to listen to it on the radio.

2. Musicians should always have Jazz venues to perform at.

3. Young people should be given the opportunity to lern the style as well as the history of it.</description>
