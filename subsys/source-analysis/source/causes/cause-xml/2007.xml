  <description>As a former employee and current volunteer at Dublin-Laurens Humane Society, I am painfully aware of the need for more serious and able-bodied volunteers.  They need intelligent, passionate, and committed people.  And more than anything, they need money. There are so many improvements the shelter would like to make, but it takes funding. This cause is dedicated to providing these two things to the shelter.

1. Dublin's local shelter is under funded.

2. Animal care and welfare is a worthy cause.

3. The way a society treats it's animals is a good measure of its overall quality.</description>
