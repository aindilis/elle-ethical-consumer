  <description>In the year 2000, 189 countries of the world agreed on the Millennium Development Goals. That includes Australia.

We hae also pledged, for many years, to give 0.7% of our GNI in foreign aid, or Official Development Assistance.

So we ask the Australian government to live up to their promise. Face Up To Poverty with Make Poverty History.
