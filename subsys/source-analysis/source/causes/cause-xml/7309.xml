  <description>I want to see if anything can be done to add recycling bins next to trash cans that are picked up at the same time as the trash. I think people would be more inclined to recycle plastics and papers if the oppurtunity was more readily availabe. I want to see this change in Abilene, Texas.

1. Recycling should be easier to do.

2. The bins should be added by the state.</description>
