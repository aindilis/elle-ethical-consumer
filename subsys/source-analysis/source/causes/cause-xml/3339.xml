  <description>Chabad at UW is a place for every Jewish Husky to hang out, learn about Judaism in a relaxed environment, with no pressure, make Jewish friends, question anything and everything, grab an awesome home-cooked meal, Shabbat dinners, and so much more!

1. We believe in Judaism.

2. We believe in Jews.

3. We believe that Jews on campus should have a place they can call their own.</description>
