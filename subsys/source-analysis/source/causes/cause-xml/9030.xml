What is Ovarian Cancer???  Ovarian cancer starts in a woman's ovaries. There are two ovaries, one on each side of the pelvis. The ovaries produce eggs and are the main source of the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. 

Ovarian Cancer in Canada
   
 2,300 new cases of ovarian cancer are found in women in Canada each year. 
1,600 Canadian women die each year of this disease, making it the fifth ranking cause of cancer deaths. 
According to 1999 figures, 6 out of 10 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in Canada are 50 to 79 years of age. 
Ovarian Cancer affects about 1 in 70 Canadian women. Although the number of cases of this cancer is relatively low, its effect is enormous. Because ovarian cancer is usually detected only in its later stages, ovarian cancer is a particularly deadly disease
