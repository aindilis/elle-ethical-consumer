  <description>have you ever gotten stuck on a remote highway,have you ever had to walk through some woods to get where your going,have you ever hit a tree with your vehicle?

NO MORE

I say remove all the virgin forest and replace it with pavement and strip malls.Cut down all the offending trees and widen the highways!
*notes: we will also be paving over quebec,denmark,romania,and macedonia









**note...any donations to this cause actually go to a non profit organization dedicated to the conservation and preservation of the enviroment,by donating you affirm you can actually read and have read this statement and therefore cannot bitch to me later about fraud saying you werent aware that the money went to a group to save trees

1. Trees are an obstructing factor to our civilization

2. the order and flatness of ashphalt and pavement well laid is an achievement to give to our children

3. more parking space means more machines which means more easyness

4. trees are a bourgoise luxury that the people cannot afford to luxuriate in this era of capitalist pseudo-life...all for the revolution comrades

5. trees cannot talk,trees cannot think,trees cannot act,therefore trees donot have a soul and cannot posees the basic rights afforded to life

6. studies indicate that people are buying more cars than ever,with mroe cars we need more parking space,wheres taht to come from,why not strip the world of its most inane resourse?</description>
