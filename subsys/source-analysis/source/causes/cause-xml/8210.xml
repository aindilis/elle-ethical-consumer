  <description>Staffordshire Terriers have long displayed signs of greatness in every household they have ever graced. Nobility isn't democratically decided on, and with this cause we are merely confirming what we all know anyway: that the Staffie is the most noble creature alive.

We all know that they love greeting new people, children, chasing pigeons and barking at lightning before running away from the thunder. Each Staffie also easily doubles up as a footstool at the base of any chair. This just confirms the humility of the creature. 

Staffies will feel the pea under the matress and make the appropriate grunting noise to notify you of his/her majesty's discomfort. This noise is also heard when turning a staffie onto its back or when carrying the noble creature to its bed.

Realize the greatness!

1. Staffies are more noble than any other creature alive; even more noble than certain humans.

2. Staffies have the right to be inside the homeat any time. This also entails an armed escourt to the bathroom facilities.

3. Staffies have the right to bark at the moon, lightning, streetlights and any other source of light at any time of the day.</description>
