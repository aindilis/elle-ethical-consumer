  <description>Graffiti has existed since ancient times, with examples going back to Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire.  Graffiti can be anything from simple scratch marks to elaborate wall paintings. In modern times, spray paint and markers have become the most commonly used materials. In most countries, defacing property with graffiti without the property owner's consent is considered vandalism, which is punishable by law. Sometimes graffiti is employed to communicate social and political messages. To some, it is an art form worthy of display in galleries and exhibitions. However, the public generally frowns upon "tags" that deface bus stops, trains, buildings, playgrounds and other public property.

1. Graffiti has existed since the ancient days, and still exists while suppressed today.

2. Some graffiti can truly be works of art, discounting the classic "b0b wuZ HeRe" types of tags.

3. Public art such as murals, bodigraff, outdoor painting, etc.aren't banned, so why should the simple writing of an alias to mark a spot should be?</description>
