  <description>For the past 3 years, starting in September 2004, I have put on a benefit concert with all proceeds going to the American Cancer Society.  Year 1 I spent over $1,000 promoting the event, and didn't raise anything.  I learned a few things, and year 2 I spent a little over $400 and raised $250.  Year 3, I spent about $150 and raised $260.  Total donations over the 3 years has been $510.  This year I'm hoping to have the event in Oxford, OH, and it may be my only concert of the year if I do.  If I can get my small business open, there will be days where I have all sales go to the ACS.  This was inspired by the fact that my mom passed away from cancer in 1994.  The first event was on the 10 year anniversary of when she passed away.

In the future, I'd like to organize other events to raise money for this cause.  Let me know if you're interested in organizing something.
