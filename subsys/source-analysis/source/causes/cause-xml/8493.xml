  <description>The children of Uganda were never given a chance to succeed and live their lives. The most unfortunate part is that the children do not know that the quality of life could be any better than the horrible conditions that they are living in. My cause will help raise money to "let them live". In other words, my cause will raise money to give the children the opportunity to succeed in life and to know that anything is possible. The final thing that my cause will do is bring the children hope, hope that the children's children will not have to live such a horrible life, hope that the children can reach their full potential, and hope that for once in their lives, they can live. 
 
To ensure that  %100 all of the donations given to this cause will directly reach the children, i will travel to Uganda and hand deliver  the money to orphanges in Uganda.
