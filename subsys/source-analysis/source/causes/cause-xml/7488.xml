  <description>there is so much animal cruelty, i would ask if you would put your name down to help stop animal creulty. if you don't you are to selfish and don't give a care. 

1. Canada's seal hunt must end.

2. people buy pets if you are going to take care of them. 

3. treat animals like humans they are just as important.</description>
