  <description>Today, you can see a wide variety of independent spirits, showing the best of creative expression and independent thought. Tomorrow, if the local government gets its way, you will see but a pale shadow of this. A drastically reduced number of vendors, forced into regulated pigeon-hole spaces they cannot leave. There will be no spontaneous displays, as empty spots cannot just be taken up by a visiting vendor. Where once vendors and artisans from around the US and the rest of the world could come, and if they found a spot, parade their wares, there will be only the vacant stares of disbelief as they are turned away, having not been able to partake in the diabolical "lottery" system.
