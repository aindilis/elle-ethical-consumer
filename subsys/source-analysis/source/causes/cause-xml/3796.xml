  <description>There have been many "causes" on here saying things that are full of hatred towards gays, different races, different religions it makes me sick. Why cant we all coexist in peace? Im honestly scared of what this world could become since when is it not okay to be who you are. People are being pressured into hating themselves and living in shadows because people dont accept them for who they are. People are people. Skin color, sexuality, being transgender, religion, ect. SHOULD NOT MATTER. What should matter is if they have a good soul.


Dont hate and discriminate, Accept and love, this planet isnt for just one kind of person (and if it was it wouldnt be very interesting)



1. Accept
