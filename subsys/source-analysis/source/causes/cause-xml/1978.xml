  <description>Are you pissed of seeing celebrities trying to ease their heavy conscience cause they're shitheads by sporting patches saying that a chicken ain't a nugget or walking semi naked saying that fur is murder? So am I. We (humans) eat animals since the dawn of time and it ain't gonna stop because of a bunch of left wing lunatics! Don't donate money to that cause, just support it, show the world you love meat and you'll eat meat till the end of your life. 

1. Humans have the right to eat meat

2. We are at the top of the food chain, we are the kings amongst kings, we'll eat what we want

3. The other PETA ( People for Ethical Treatement of Animals ) suck and are a bunch of fucking bleeding heart liberals. They force kids into their beliefs, they must be stopped

4. ALF ( Animal Liberation Front ) are considered the number one domestic terrorist association in america. They wanna save animals by hurting men... hurt them, don't be shy to spit on people sporting ALF / PETA t shirts, sticker or patches</description>
