  <description> Everyone knows about Darfur, but what about the massive amount of murders and rapes that occur in the Congo everyday. One center that victims can go to says they see 12 new victims everyday. Women have to hide from the men. Rapists are rarely convicted. There is no punishment for them. Rape is often also used as a weapon by local militias. People's houses are looted daily. Militia groups refuse to give up their weapons. People live in fear and this cannot continue.
Also....Gorillas are there. Save them too.
