  <description>Few decades ago a certain type of organization was formed due to the high rates of suicidal deaths called the "Emos". These people left everything and everyone they every knew behind, turned their back on them, and just walked their seperate paths. Due to the increase in this group over the years the suicidal death rates have increased massively leaving nothing but blood on the floors and crying mothers on a grave. They have endulged in many unenthical matters from wierd clothes, musci, and hair to being the number 1 bestseller and buyer of drugs in the world.
