  <description>We are a non-profit summer camp for visually impaired  children from PA, NJ, NY, MD, SC and most of the eastern seaboard. The camp costs the children nothing to come spend a week in Avalon,NJ at our facilities. All meals and lodging is provided. Some activities include a Ferry Ride to Delaware, Amusement Parks, Phillies Games, trips to the beach, and other shopping and beach activities such as kickball and wiffleball. We operate solely on donations from the general public and the local Stone Harbor Lions Club. 

1. Give the children a week long vacation of fun.</description>
