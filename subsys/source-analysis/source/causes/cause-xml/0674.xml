  <description> What is 1/24?
It's an idea, movement, program, movie, basically a lot of things. 

However, to sum it up, we are trying to raise money, awareness, and personal moral. 1/24 comes from the fact that one sixth of the world's population lives on less than $1 each day, that's 1 billion people. Pretty sad, huh? Well, we're going to do something about it. 

People will sign up, and on a date in the summer of 2007 (we need lots of time to raise lots of money, and get lots of people involved), we will all gather together in Midland (downtown) and live off of $1 for 24 hours. Before the date, the people signed up will raise money which will all be donated to poverty related charities who are helping to end poverty. 

ALL IN ALL:
Committing ourselves to experience, for one day, what they have for all of theirs.
