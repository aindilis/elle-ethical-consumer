  <description>NAMI has been working for 25 years to become the nation's voice on mental illness. NAMI has been helpful to my family as my father was diagnosed with a mental disorder. When a person suffers from mental illness it disables them from living a full healthy life and it affects their family members as well. NAMI helps to provide and supply information for family members that are struggling with a mental illness in their home.

Some information on mental disorders from the NAMI website:

Mental illnesses are biologically based brain disorders.  They cannot be overcome through "will power" and are not related to a person's "character" or intelligence. 

The World Health Organization has reported that four of the 10 leading causes of disability in the US are mental disorders.

It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 families in America. 

1. Those with mental disorders are human beings too.

2. Mental illnesses can affect persons of any age, race, religion or income.</description>
