  <description>Three sharks die every second. Since first of January 2007 till date (i.e. 9th june '07), this amounts to 

 44244977 animals. 

 


  Each year more than 600,000 to 700,000 tons of sharks are caught and slaughtered. This is the equivalent of more than 100 million sharks per year. 


Wrongly maligned as man-eating monsters, sharks seldom attack humans, but their populations are being rapidly depleted by overfishing and other human activities. 

Moreover, an estimated 50 percent of the sharks captured worldwide are part of what is called the bycatch--that is, the fish caught accidentally, while attempting to catch other species

Another problem is that large numbers of sharks are killed and wasted through the practice of finning them at sea. Shark fins are often used in Asian soups, and their market value is much higher than that of other shark products. Consequently, some fishermen remove the fins and discard the rest of the shark's body into the sea.


Without the ecologically important control mechanism exercised by sharks, our oceans would be in danger.It is incumbent on us to devise appropriate strategies to protect and restore the populations of these sea creatures.  

 Help us to protect these fascinating "hunted hunters".
