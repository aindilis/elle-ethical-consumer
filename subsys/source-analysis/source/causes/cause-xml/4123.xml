  <description>You may remember Frankie Abernathy from the San Diego season of MTV's The Real World back in 2004.  Frankie was the roommate who was "too punk rock," but still managed to live life to the fullest, and stay true to herself. Sadly, Frankie passed away last weekend, from causes still yet to be determined, after a lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis. 

For many of us, Frankie was more than another castmate on The Real World.  She gave people a sense of hope, showing the world her problems with cutting, depression, and phobias, and that it was ok to be different.  She had the courage to expose her problems and fears, and in turn gave everyone who had the same or similar problems someone to look up to and admire for their courage.

Frankie will definitely be missed by all the people who she has touched.  In her memory you can donate funds to: 

Frankie Abernathy Scholarship Fund, 
c/o Jackie Langston
1205 NW Roanoke Drive
Blue Springs, MO 64015
