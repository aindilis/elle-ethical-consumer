  <description>     Every day, millions of vegetables are unfairly harvested, shipped, and boiled, sauteed, fried, chopped, sliced, diced, steamed, baked....or even just eaten RAW. 

     We vow to stop this treatment through the following positions.





Remember: Animals can't feel pain, but vegetables feel it EVERY DAY.

1. Eat more meat and less vegetables.

2. Legalize multi-animal meat compounds for sale in the US and continue education of proper meat-eating habits.

3. Riot outside of farms and canneries.</description>
