  <description>This will be my 8th year participating in Aids Walk Vancouver. 

AIDS WALK is a celebration of life for those living with HIV and AIDS, and a time of reflection and tribute for those we've lost.

AIDS carries many misconceptions and stigma, but it affects more people than you know - from all walks of life, young and adult. It is estimated that 39.5 million people are living with this currently incurable disease.

Please join me as I walk in support for awareness of - and a future without - AIDS.
