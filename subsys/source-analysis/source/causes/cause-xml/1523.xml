  <description>The Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA) is deeply concerned about the crisis in Sudan. For years we have worked with our coaltion partners, including the American Jewish World Service, to call attention to the plight and suffering of the Darfurians.

Come Join our effort and advocate for a stronger US and UN response to this ongoing genocide. We will post rescources here and we encourage you to use them to organize your community.
