Each and everyday children globally suffer from many types of cancer, Many of us do our best in helping these children fight this horrendous disease, we could visit them love them support them, and offer what we have to help with costs  this foundation is named after my late father who may have lost the battle to the disease a few years ago but, even in his own state he help give confidence back to a child with the disease also



1. we must continue  helping them on their fight

2. we must help these children as much as we can

3. we must never give up</description>
