  <description>Camelot, a nonprofit organization, offers one-on-one horsemanship education to children and adults who have physical disabilities. Since inception in 1980, all services have been offered at no cost. Students learn all aspects of horsemanship including riding, grooming, training, showing, vet care and stable management.

Camelot&#8217;s ranch is located on 14.5 acres of the Sonoran Desert in the Pinnacle Peak area of Arizona. Their unique wheelchair accessible facility makes it possible for students to saddle, groom and ride their horses with minimal help. 

Using the horse as a metaphor of life, students learn to become stronger than the obstacles in their path. In spite of such disabilities as blindness, paralysis, amputation and hearing impairment, many of students go to own their own horses. Please check out Camelot&#8217;s website at www.camelot-th.org to learn more!
