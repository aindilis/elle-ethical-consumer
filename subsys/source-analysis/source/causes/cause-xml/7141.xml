  <description>The end goal of this cause is to live in a sustainable community within a sustainable world.  In order for this to become a reality, there will need to be an effective balance between environmental, economic, and social sustainability.

Working toward this goal, successful case studies derived from experience are invaluable.  The hard-learned lessons then need to be shared with an ever-growing audience to gain mass acceptance.

This process begins with a commitment to organizations like the "Alliance for Sustainable Colorado".  Through their cooperative work with individuals, non-profit organizations, business, and government they have proven a working model that can be adopted more broadly.

Please join me in showing your support for best practices in real-world sustainable development.

1. Protect and preserve the integrity of the biosphere.

2. Respect the natural environment and the limits of the planet&#8217;s finite resources.

3. Build an effective balance between environmental, economic, and social sustainability.</description>
