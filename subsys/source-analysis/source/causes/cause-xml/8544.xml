  <description>Holt's approach is unique - it's centered on the child.

Holt is much more than an adoption agency. We also develop and maintain programs overseas to give orphaned, abandoned and vulnerable children safe and nurturing environments in which to develop.

While children are waiting for permanent families, we place them with foster families where they will enjoy an attentive, family-like environment. The quality care helps children develop, and it helps them to better prepare to bond with their adoptive parents. In situations where we must use institutional care, we use a high ratio of childcare workers to children along with attentive childcare methods that ensure children receive physical and verbal affection and stimulation. We consider each child's situation individually to find the best long-term solution for that child. Because we also investigate the possibilities of preserving the birth family or domestic adoption, you can be assured that international adoption was the best solution for your child.

With our staff at work on both sides of the ocean, the rights and lives of all involved in the adoption are safeguarded - the child, the birth parents and the adoptive parents. Our ultimate goal is always to see the child safely, happily and permanently in the right loving home.
