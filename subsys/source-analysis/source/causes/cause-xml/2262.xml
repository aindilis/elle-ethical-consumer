  <description>The TKE Educational Foundation is an educational, charitable, tax-exempt organization that is completely independent of the Fraternity. Because of its organization as a 501(c)(3) corporation, the TKE Educational Foundation is able to provide a tax-advantaged means to support scholarship, leadership development, and personal achievement.

Annually, the Foundation awards scholarships to TKE members, grants to Fraternity programs like Regional Leadership Conferences, and funds other leadership programs including the TKE Leadership Academy.
