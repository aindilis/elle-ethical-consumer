  <description>Located in the Guatemala City Dump, Safe Passage seeks out children living in the surrounding area.  These children have no access to free education, and are often living in starvation.  

Through generous donations from people like you, Safe Passage is able to provide food, shelter and an education to hundreds of kids (that number grows every year!).  By providing the children with the tools they need to be successful, Safe Passage is slowly but surely breaking the poverty cycle within the dump.  

Founded by Hanley Denning, Safe Passage carries her spirit and vision forward through the heart of the children in the Guatemalan City Dump.
