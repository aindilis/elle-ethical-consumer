  <description>The Campaign to End AIDS (C2EA) is a diverse, exciting new coalition of people living with HIV/AIDS, their advocates and their loved ones. Together, we're demanding that our leaders exert the political will to stop the epidemic, in the U.S. and abroad, once and for all. In small towns and big cities across America, we're mobilizing to ensure the best treatment and care for all HIV-positive people...and HIV prevention methods backed by good science.



1. Fully fund quality treatment and support services for all people living with HIV everywhere.

2. Ramp up HIV prevention at home and abroad, guided by science rather than ideology.

3. Increase research to find a cure, more effective treatments and better prevention tools.

4. Fight AIDS stigma and protect the civil rights of all people with HIV and AIDS everywhere.</description>
