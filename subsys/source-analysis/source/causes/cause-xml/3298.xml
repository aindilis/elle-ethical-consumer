  <description>The Student Association for Voter Empowerment (SAVE), is a non-profit, non-partisan organization whose purpose is to promote an emphasis in civic engagement for the youth citizens of America. By targeting the inaccessible nature of election laws and advocating policy reform that will facilitate
younger voters, we hope to make voting accessible to all citizens, particularly to our generation. The only student-led organization of our kind, we focus on reforming elections rather than simply getting out the vote.

By engaging in the processes of voting and political activism, the youth of America has the capacity to elect the officials who will make our generation's issues, their issues.  Through political engagement, we can make the difference in the social justice realms that mean the most to us.   The vote is meant to be the great equalizer, the greatest power we have as American citizens.  Lets use it.
