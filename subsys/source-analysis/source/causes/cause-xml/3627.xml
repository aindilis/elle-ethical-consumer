  <description>The road traveled by those facing a life-limiting illness can be a difficult one.  It is a journey that many cannot walk alone.  Hope Hospice, our area&#8217;s first hospice, has shared these journeys with countless patients and their loved ones since 1984 by providing everything needed to help manage the patient&#8217;s illness, including expert pain and symptom control, medications, medical equipment and supplies, various types of therapy, plus emotional, spiritual and bereavement support for the entire family.
