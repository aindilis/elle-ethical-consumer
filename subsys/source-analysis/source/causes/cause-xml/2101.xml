  <description>We , as Muslims, hand by hand with non-Muslims, want to tell the world that our religion - Islam - is PEACE and LOVE confirming that Muslims are not terrorists or haters !

We just want to live in peace and those who spread terrorism in the name of Islam are not Muslims and we don't accept them in our religion and they don't represent us.

THIS CAUSE IS ABOUT DEFENDING ISLAM NOT ATTACKING OTHER BELIEFS ..

THIS CAUSE IS FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THIS IDEA .. 

I hope you reflect our religion as great as it is ..



Thank you .

1. The majority Muslims are peace loving citizens and Islam is a beautiful harmonious faith which advocates peace.

2. Throughout history Muslims , like people from all faiths too have been victims of indiscriminate acts of terrorisms.

3.  Islam condemns terrorism in all forms especially attacks on innocent women and children.

4. The Media is undoubtedly using Islam and Muslims as convenient guinea pigs for the sake of making headlines.

5. Terror has no faith.</description>
