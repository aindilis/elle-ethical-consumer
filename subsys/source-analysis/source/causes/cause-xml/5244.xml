  <description>WE are being gauged to the max by gas companys so I want cheaper gas cause like they need to make more money than they have . They don't pay an employee much money to do the hard / Dangerous job that they have. 
How many people have been shot,stabbed,held-up, ripped off, dragged up the road til they are dead, you get the point? Or do you really ???? 
It sickens me, the things that happen over fuel ..... gas diesel, propane whatever it is IT HAS TO STOP NOW. 
If we ALL band together this will stop. I believe it  or in it. WE need it to stop. Everyone wants to rich or afford the things in our dreams. I do of course .... I want ALL the things in my really good dreams. So ban PETRO CANADA cause they are the largest, greedy, gas guzzeling, sons of you Know in Canada and the rest will follow suit. SIMPLE isn't it. 
So "Do IT" not for me for you. Cause I can't think of a better cause than that right now in my moment of clarity. Cause I get alot of that ......now. Cause it's a good cause.
Most importantly cause why do people Die For Fuel.

 "That's all I have to say about that"- Forest Gump

I hope it works ............ this time 

1. Why do good people die for gas 

2. Gas makes the world go round.... but isn't worth killing for 

3. Ever siphon gas and get a mouth full... Was it worth it ?????????</description>
  <mission>Get cheaper gas so Ban Petro Can. Then tell the world so we can all change it one step at a time.</mission>
