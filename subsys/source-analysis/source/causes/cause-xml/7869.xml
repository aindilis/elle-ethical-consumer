  <description>I started this cause because of my little sister, Emily, who was diagnosed with glutaric acidemia, specifically GA1. It has caused her to become physically disabled even though inside she's as normal as you and I. The worst part is, this could have been prevented by a few simple blood tests at birth (known as Newborn Screening). This is a big issue that I feel doesn't get as much attention as it should.

~~~~~~~~~NEWS!!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm a little late reporting this news but this year Emily finally was able to go on her very own Make-a-Wish trip to....Disney World of course! Although I wasn't able to go myself, I had school : ( , Emily had a fantastic time. She loved every minute of it but she especially enjoyed the Shrek ride at Universal and the High School Musical parade in Disney, even though it wasn't really Zack Efron. Make-a-Wish provided her with a really amazing, once in a life time trip that our whole family is greatful for.
