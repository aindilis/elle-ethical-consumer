  <description>Wal-Mart is a textbook book example of one of the worst market failures- monopsony. As it is with a monopoly, in which one seller dictates the price and quantity of a given good to be sold, a monopsony dictates price and quantity by dominating the buyer's market to the point of controlling price and quantity by pressuring the producers. This is why monopsonies are also called ''reverse monopolies.'' 

In the end, Wal-Mart's lower prices today mean less jobs and less market freedom for producers in the future. If Wal-Mart continues to trample the market in almost every major corner of the retail business, their monopsony will only continue to devastate the middle class to a greater degree in the future.

Bring attention to this issue! Monopolies are challenged frequently all across the country, don't let a potentially more damaging market failure continue to grow just because it is less common. Monopsony is illegal, and Wal-Mart must be regulated!


1. Boycott Wal-Mart immediately!

2. Inform your Representative and/or Senator about Wal-Mart's illegal monopsony and encourage them to regulate Wal-Mart.

3. Raise awareness about Wal-Mart's unfair and (in most cases) illegal treatment of their workers.</description>
