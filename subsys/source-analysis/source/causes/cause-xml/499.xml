  <description>We are here to inform the masses about sickle cell anemia and other sickle cell conditions. As well as sharing information and networking, we promote the search for a cure, the equal rights of those aflicted by the disease (esspecially in the working environment), and most of all, we promote the thought of living a natural, "normal" life while still having this disease.

1. Those ethnicities of highest risk need to go get themselves tested for sickle cell

2. Sickle Cell does not affect only African Americans, contrary to popular consensus

3. We as human  beings will someday find a cure to this disease</description>
