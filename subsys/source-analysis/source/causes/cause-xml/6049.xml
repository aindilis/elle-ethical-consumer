  <description>We as citizens of today's  "global" world have to be more responsible towards our counterparts in other countries. We have to assume a greater role in letting people govern themselves and the only way to achieve that is promoting democracy. Aung Saan Su Kyi's Natinal League For Democarcy in Myannmar and Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement For Democratic Change in Zimbabwe might have lost relevance to their governments. But these people who have been championing for the causes of the people must be supported by us because we as the global and responsible citizens and leaders of tomorrow have more to achieve. 

1. people need reforms in order to choose their own governments because they know what is best for them

2. people need democratic refoems in order to evict the corrupt governments

3. people do need reforms in order to promote Human rights</description>
