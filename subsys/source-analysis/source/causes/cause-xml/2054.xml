  <description>The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) was founded after the violent lynching of a Jewish man in 1917.  Initially, they fought to end anti-Semitism in America.  Over the past 90 years, they have expanded their goals to include monitoring and restricting bigoted groups of all stripes, and advocating for victims of all types of hate crimes.  

1. People must not be permitted to defame or injure other people on the basis of race, religion, gender, or sexuality.

2. It is vital that bigoted groups are monitored and that hate crimes are successfully prosecuted.

3. Increasing tolerance through education is crucial to the personal safety of members of all minorities.</description>
