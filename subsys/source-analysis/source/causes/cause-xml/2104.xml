  <description>Juvenile Dermatomyositis is a rare auto immune disease that has put Ashley on an up and down roller coaster for the last 2 years. She was diagnosed when she was 3 and has had to under go several medicines and treatment to try and beat this. She is now getting IVIG treatments which is a blood product given to her through IV treatments. We are hoping this is what she needs to finally beat this!!
