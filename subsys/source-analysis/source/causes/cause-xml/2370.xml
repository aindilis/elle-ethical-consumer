  <description>I am starting this cause in honor of my Mom who has been a survivor of Breast Cancer for 4 years now.  I have done many walks with her in honor of her strength and courage through her struggle to beat this horrendous disease.  She is my idol and those of you who know her can understand why.

Remember to get your mammograms girls!  Please don't be another who must undergo such treatments for something that is so serious!

Donate if you want or just join...the more members, the bigger the smile on my Mom's face at night! 

Thanks everyone!

1. Breast Cancer takes too many lives every year!
