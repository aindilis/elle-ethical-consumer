  <description>Ever wondered why pubs can't choose to become smoking pubs and let workers sign a contract stating they know the risks? 

Ever wondered why we dont ditch silly plans like the Millenium dome and use the cash on building more prisons?

Ever wondered why illegal immigrants can get a hospital bed before you, a national?

Ever wondered why America does not ban the gun?

Us too ! thats why we are asking for your help in creating a UK Government that stands for common sense rather than pander to ridiculous ideas. 

We mostly rally for common sense within the UK government and day to day life but we like to help other countries too where common sense is lacking. So wherever your from, join in and make your voice heard.
