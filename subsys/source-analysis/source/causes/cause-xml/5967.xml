This simple,  safe, and private two minute step toward peace could contribute to saving hundreds of thousands of people from being needlessly destroyed in the process of national conflicts that take place throughout the world on a regular basis. All governments need to know that the world is demanding peace, equality and safety for all people of every origin.

1. Equality is a human experience not a conceptual idea.

2. Within the experience of human equality war is impossible

3. Every act of war is a crime against humanity
