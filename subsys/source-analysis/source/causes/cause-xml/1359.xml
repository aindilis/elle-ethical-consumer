  <description>SO, last summer Colin Peters and I viewed "An Inconvenient Truth" and I started to feel guilty. Thus, SAPS was born. Yo, a full grown tree converts over a ton of Carbon Dioxide into Oxygen every year or something like that. So, if you plant some trees you can lessen your carbon footprint or even bring it down to zero. Lets say you and your car and electrical uses put 4 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere this year...If you plant 4 trees youre kind of making up for it. Kind of like the time Steve Lipton ate an entire stash of my Moon Pies and then offered to buy replacements...except with trees in this case...not delicious chocolate snack cakes...but you get the point. So basically join this cause by planting some trees of your own or giving me some dinero to go out and buy trees to plant from the arbor day foundation. 

1. CO2 contributes to global warming

2. Trees remove lots of CO2 from the air

3. Rod's trying to plant trees

4. You should probably help out...youll feel less guilty about buying that Hummer.

5. Jay Treuhaft is the O.G. of the Table Tennis playing, Quiz Bowlin' student demographic. </description>
