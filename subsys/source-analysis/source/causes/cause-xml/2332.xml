  <description>Pitbulls have been targetted as a danger breed of dogs. But my mission is to abolish that image. I am an owner of a pitbull and she is one of the sweetest dogs that I have ever had a chance to interact with. Pitbulls are awesome pets if they are raised with love and affection, which is the same for any dog. A chihuahua would be vicious too if it was raised the same way a lot of pitbull owners raise their dogs. So join this group if you own a pitbull, or just agree that they are not the monsters people make them out to be. 

1. Pitbulls are not dangerous animals

2. They deserve to be treated like any other breed of dog

3. They don't deserve to be outlawed!</description>
