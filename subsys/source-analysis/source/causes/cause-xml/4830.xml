  <description>Please support this unique project that Benjamin Quinto, my best friend and colleague whom I have worked with in co-founding the Global Youth Action Network (www.youthlink.org) in New York has proposed. 

It is an interactive public awareness campaign using the "every dollar is a vote" concept, driven by civic participation, in which corporations are ranked by their social responsibility, labour practices and ecological impact. The growing trend in consumer awareness and responsibility, and the desire of people to support companies that do not harm the environment, or engage in human rights abuses, ensures the broad interest this project could generate. 

The campaign will allow consumers to rate businesses in a centralized database (using both web and mobile technologies), ranking corporations by their practices. At the same time, through the collection of data and research conducted (on issues such as child labour, waste and pollution measures, etc), we can educate the public about the impact of their purchasing habits, and display a map of their collective buying power. The running list would track changes in policy and practices by corporations, and also consumer feedback and experiences.
