  <description>The title says it all. Most chain restaurants are expensive, unhealthy, and could care less about you're local economy. Small independent, "Mom &amp; Pop" establishments often offer better quality food, friendlier service, inexpensive meals, and an all around better atmosphere.  

Just say no to chain restaurants and contribute to your local economy by only dining out at independent establishments, while there are still a few left. Really, who would you rather give your money to; a big, lifeless corporation, or your neighbors?

1. Take pride in local independent business.

2. Be a good neighbor/citizen.

3. Tip well, they deserve it.</description>
