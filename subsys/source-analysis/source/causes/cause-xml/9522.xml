  <description>This cause is basically a declaration that we, as the potential future war machines of our nations, will refuse to participate in so base a thing as an escalation in violence and/or war. Having realized the great errancy  that is found in blind patriotism and war, we are finally saying enough and refusing to engage in any further combat, whether it be physical or verbal. The wars of our fathers will not prevail in our generation!

1. War is simply unacceptable

2. Diplomacy is a necessity

3. Stopping War simply starts with the average citizen living peace in his everyday life</description>
