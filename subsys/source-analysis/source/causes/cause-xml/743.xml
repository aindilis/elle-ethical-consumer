  <description>The Chicago Abortion Fund (CAF) fights to overturn economic barriers to reproductive choice. Through direct service and education/advocacy, CAF assists low-income women in obtaining safe abortion services by providing clinic referrals, negotiated discounts and financial assistance. While we are unable to directly assist all the women in need, we work to extend choice to all low-income women by making the issue of economic access a priority on the agenda of policy makers.

Please note that by using this service, you agree that JustGive will deduct a small transaction fee of 4.5% from your donation to cover standard processing costs and that this fee is deducted before JustGive disburses your donation to the charity.
