  <description>Since 1999, Shalom House has had a significant, positive impact on the lives of many, many women.  For the last eight years, ladies have broken the cycle of addiction in the halfway house.  

In 2004, we opened a second halfway house.  And later this year, 2007, we are opening a full-scale treatment center.  Your donation will directly help Shalom House in the start-up phase of the new treatment center.  

Thank you for your generosity.

Shalom House believes that women who have struggled with drugs and alcohol need a safe place to regroup after receiving treatment but before returning home.  We provide that place by offering a structured, spiritual, nurturing environment where the women can learn independent living skills which will help break the cycle of chemical dependence.





1. We hope to help women have a new life without the need for alcohol and drugs in their everyday life.</description>
