  <description>Do you, like me, question where your tax pounds go? Do wonder why we went to war, even though the majority of the nation was against it? Do you believe that your government should be representing the overall needs of the people in its nation, and not pandering to big corporations for extra money? Have you had enough of your government handing over your country to nations that would not give us any rights, if and when we visit them?

If you answered yes to all or any of these questions then please give your support. With your support we could make a difference. A waterfall starts with 1 drop of water, please help us to make a splash.
