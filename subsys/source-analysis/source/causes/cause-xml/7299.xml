  <description>I was watching Canadian Idol right now and they kicked off the two people who were different, and weren't their stupid pathetic mould of a perfect pop singer. It pisses me off. They're looking for some skinny waisted, blonde or chestnut hair'd girls, and a boy band look a like boy to be their stupid Best singer, When some of them cant sing very well.

This makes me angry and it has led me to start this cause. I feel that the 'ideal' of many people, places, and shows has led us to feel so crappy about ourselves and make us feel we need to change. If I want to sing rock music and dye my hair, I most certainly won't win american/candian idol. If I want to weight 140 pounds I most certainly won't win America's next top model.  If I have a pretty face, big boobs, and can hold a few notes, Ill win any singing competition. If I'm 105 pounds and 5'8 - 5'10 I'll win any modeling shows. If I'm pretty and skinny I'll get hired just so ppl will buy things from me. It happened to someone I know. This makes me angry. 

Embrace how people look, their differences, and their lifestyles they want to chose. Stop believing these pathetic 'perfect' pictures everyone is telling us to be. Be yourself and be different. 

1. BE DIFFERENT

2. GET RID OF PATHETIC "IDEALS"

3. ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THESE IDEALS ARE IN FACT PATHETIC</description>
