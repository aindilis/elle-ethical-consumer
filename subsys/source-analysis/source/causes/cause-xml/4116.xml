  <description>Many many aminals are hunted and killed every year. With your donations we can adopt animals and help provide protecting against poachers. 

Without your donations these animals are not being protected and can he killed very easily.

Here are some facts about some animals i am trying to adopt:

TIGERS-are the largest of all the cats. There is estimated to be only 5000-7000 in the wild. They require a lot of space, they will walk 10 miles a night in search for food.

WOLVES-Are very territorial with dens, travel routes, and feeding grounds. They are being rehibiliated back into the wild from zoo capitity but we need your help preserving them so we dont almost loose them again

PANDAS-is the symbol of the world wildlife fund. They are very lovable but very shy. New born pandas are about the size of a stick of butter and they depend heavily on their mother in the first few months of life. Although when the mothers are killed by poachers the baby usually dies.

LEOPARDS Love to climb in trees. They are wonderful hunters by hiding in the grass and then pouncing on their prey, and then hoist the animal up the tree where they protect themselves from lions and hyenas/
