  <description>The League of Women Voters Education Fund (LWVEF) is a 501 (c)(3) citizen education and research organization. Established in 1957, the Education Fund provides research, publications and forums on public policy issues and disseminates information and training that helps citizens be thoughtfully engaged in the democratic process.

In communities across the nation, Leagues are well known for providing voters with factual, NONPARTISAN information on candidates and ballot issues. State and local Leagues are also known for hosting citizen educational forums on critical public policy issues of the day.

In short, the League is well recognized for its ability to make complex and controversial issues accessible to the nonexpert citizen in a balanced manner, for its ability to gather citizens with diverse views, and for its expertise as a trainer of community leaders and activists.
