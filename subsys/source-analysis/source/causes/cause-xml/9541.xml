  <description>  We, the members of this Labor Party, see ourselves as keepers of the American Dream of opportunity, fairness, and justice. In our American Dream, we all have the right:

    * To a decent paying job and a decent place to live
    * To join a union freely without fear of being fired or other retribution
    * To strike without fear of losing our job
    * Not to be discriminated against because of our race, gender, ethnicity, disability, national origin, or sexual orientation, at work or in our communities
    * To free, quality public education for ourselves and our children
    * To universal access to publicly-funded, comprehensive, quality health care for all residents
    * To retire at a decent standard of living after a lifetime of work
    * To quality of life in our communities enhanced by a fully funded public sector.
