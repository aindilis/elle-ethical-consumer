  <description>-Every two and a half minutes, somewhere in America, someone is sexually assaulted.

-One in six American women are victims of sexual assault, and one in 33 men.

-In 2004-2005, there were an average annual 200,780 victims of rape, attempted rape or sexual assault.

-About 44% of rape victims are under age 18, and 80% are under age 30.

-Since 1993, rape/sexual assault has fallen by over 69%.

Let's keep up the progress.
