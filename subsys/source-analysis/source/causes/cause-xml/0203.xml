  <description>CODEPINK is a women-initiated grassroots peace and social justice movement working to end the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, stop new wars, and redirect our resources into healthcare, education and other life-affirming activities. We reject fear-based politics that justify violence, and instead call for policies based on compassion, kindness and a commitment to international law.  With an emphasis on joy and humor, CODEPINK women and men seek to activate, amplify and inspire a community of peacemakers through creative campaigns and a commitment to non-violence.
