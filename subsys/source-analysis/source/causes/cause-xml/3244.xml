  <description>I'll elaborate on this cause later, but basically it is what it is.  For more information please visit peta.org --there is a lot of information you don't know about the treatment of animals.  Here are a few VERY disturbing videos on the fur trade.. dogs, cats, seals, minks, etc.. are also used and killed and skinned alive for their fur.. most of the time when you think you are wearing other animals.. there are other traces of domestic animals as well.  Please visit this website to watch..

For more information on activism, again please visit: peta.org

This is a very common issue and if you have half a heart, you will at least take the time to learn about it.

Thanks for your interest, guys :]
