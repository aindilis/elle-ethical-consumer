  <description>How can you have religious/philosophical freedom in America if we don't keep up the separation of church and state? We don't have to be hostile to any religion, we just need to keep it out of our schools.

Some teachers actually think it is right to begin speaking about religion in school &#8212; as in religious indoctrination, not just teaching about different religions.

1. Religious indoctrination is not a thing that should happen in schools.

2. Students should not have to appear to conform to any religion to please their fellow classmates or their teacher.

3. The separation of church and state must be maintained.</description>
