  <description>People of the world gather and help this beautiful couple get a decent house! Donna and Mike are hardworking, easygoing and striving to get their own house. This is a petition to buy them a house - otherwise she is gonna get pregnant and we all know she shouldn't have kids. Donna tried to quit smoking to save money, even tried fasting to save money on food! You can see that they are really working towards their goal... be kind and help.

1. Donna and Mike deserve a house.

2. Porsche needs a decent yard.

3. We believe that animal cruelty is bad.</description>
