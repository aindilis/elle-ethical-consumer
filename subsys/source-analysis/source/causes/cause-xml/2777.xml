  <description>Orangutans live in the countrys of Malaysia and Indonesia. They live in the asian rainforests. They're dieing out because of many causes. A main cause is palm oil plants filling the space where the trees they lived in used to be. They wonder around disoriented and lost, often starving to death. Plantatoin workers take no mercy on the orangutans.The males are killed, often tortured. The females are killed but sometime used for prostitution. The babies are kept in small cages and are traded internationally. Now you have a chance to give a fund to help these unfortunate orangutans live.

1. Plantatoin workers should be taught how to handle the appearence of an orangutan

2. Orangutans should have a safe environment  to live in

3. Orangutans should no longer be endangered</description>
