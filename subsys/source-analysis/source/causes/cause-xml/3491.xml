  <description>To stop wasting water before it is too late

3.3 million people die yearly because of water shortage problems, 90 percent among these people are children.  For example, a child in Africa only have a little less than one gallon per day to survive with, however; an average American use up to 80 to 100 gallon of water per day.

A study show that by 2025, countries will go to war for water instead of oil and within 10 years, the price for water will go up around 5 times higher than now.  Since the price for water go up, other needs, such as foods, will go up as well.

After all, ways to start saving water are easy. The following are only some simple ways to save water:
&#8226; Turn off the water while brushing your teeth
&#8226; Fixing leaky toilets
&#8226; Shorten showering time by as little as one minute (If every American shorten their shower by one minute, 1.5 billion gallons of water will be saved each day)
