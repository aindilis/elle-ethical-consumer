  <description>Dementia is a brain disorder that causes a loss of brain function it is usually progressive and more often than not becomes severe.
Memory loss, confusion and problems with speech and understanding are the main symptons of dementia. 
It affects the elderly most prominently. Most people become reliant on care whether from family or employed in order to be able to carry out acitvities of daily living (ADL). Care for the elderly in the UK is often expensive and therefore inaccessible for many OAPs living on government pensions. 

There is also alot that is unknown about dementia and no current known cure, so research, although expensive is vital to learning more.

There are currently an estimated 700,000 people in the UK who suffer with dementia. 

The proportion of people with dementia doubles with every 5yr age gap.

60,000 deaths a year are directly linked to dementia.

Family carers of people with dementia save the UK over &#163;6 billion a year.

1 in 6 people over the age of 80 in the UK have a form of dementia.

1. Research is essential for improving the lives of people with dementia and those who will contract it in the future.

2. As our population steadily ages, dementia will become more and more of a problem if we don't do something about it now.

3. The way the elderly who are unable to do alot of things for themselves are treated in the UK is wrong.</description>
