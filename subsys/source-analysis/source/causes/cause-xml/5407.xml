  <description>George Bush, the Warmonger is coming to town!
It's up to us to give him the welcome he deserves!

If you are as pissed as the rest of us because Bush is:

* A mass-murderer responsible for the death of thousands of people in Iraq and Afghanistan
* A filthy liar shoving WMD's up UN's arse
* A disgrace to humanity, destroying our mother Earth
* A vicious criminal legalising torture at Guantanamo Bay
* An arrogant racist fascist, dismantling the little that is left of democracy
* A moron who can't make sentences out of words
* THE real terrorist

then help us take the matter to the streets!

Time: 10 am, Sat 8 September
Place: Sydney Town Hall

Let's prepare ourselves and make this APEC a conference he'll never forget!
