  <description>The Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation's roots stretch back to 1982 when the American Paralysis Association was formed by a group of people that refused to accept the prevailing notion that the spinal cord, once injured, could not be repaired. The founders of the American Paralysis Association had an unwavering belief that researchers and neuroscientists, working together, would find a way to connect and regenerate the damaged nerves and cells that result in paralysis.

Christopher sought out the organization following his injury in 1995. As Christopher said, "I have always been a crusader for causes I believe in. This time, the cause found me." Christopher shared the American Paralysis Association's belief in a cure and lent his name, passion and drive to the organization which ultimately became known as the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation.

Together, we've come a long way. The research progress in recent years has been outstanding. Awareness and perception of spinal cord injuries has shifted dramatically, both in the scientific community as well as in the general public. Today, our belief in a cure is shared by the neuroscientists, researchers, clinicians and, perhaps most importantly, thousands of people living with spinal cord injuries and their families. The momentum is ours. We will Go Forward.
