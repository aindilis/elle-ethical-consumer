  <description>A grassroots effort to find, highlight and stop government waste.  

"Porkbusters represent what is arguably the only grassroots movement since 1994 to gain traction and build momentum on the core American principle of limited government. The Porkbusters movement is not particularly concerned with the electoral fate of Republicans or Democrats, but they are concerned with the fate of the Republic and their own tax dollars. Quite simply, Porkbusters is a movement comprised of individuals who are just plain sick of their money being wasted, quite often in secret, by self-serving politicians." - Tom Coburn (R-KS)

&#8220;I&#8217;ll just say this about the so-called Porkbusters. I&#8217;m getting damn tired of hearing from them. They have been nothing but trouble ever since Katrina.&#8221; - Trent Lott (R-MS)
