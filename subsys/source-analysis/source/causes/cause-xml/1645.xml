  <description>THOUSANDS OF CALGARIANS GO TO WORK FULLTIME EVERYDAY, AND ARE FORCED TO PAY RIDICULOUSLY HIGH RENTS, LIVE WITH WAY TOO MANY ROOMATES SHARING A HOUSE, OR LIVE IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CRACKHOUSE BECAUSE A SMALL PERCENTAGE HAVE MONEY. THE MIDDLE-LOWER CLASS CAN'T KEEP UP...WHAT ABOUT A NEW FAMILY, HOW ARE THEY TO SURVIVE? DON'T WE WANT PROPER CARE FOR OUR CHILDEREN AND OURSELVES? HOME SHOULD BE WHERE WE FEEL SAFE AND COMFORTABLE AND ONLY A PORTION OF OUR INCOME SHOULD GO TO THE ROOF OVER OUR HEADS, SO WHY ARE THERE SO MANY CALGARIANS LIVING IN THESE HARSH CONDITIONS? BECAUSE GREEDY BASTARDS DECIDE TO RAISE THE RENT BY A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS, OR CONVERT APARTMENTS INTO "CONDO'S". IT'S A LANDLORD(OR SLUMLORD'S) MARKET AND THE TENANT AND THIER PERSONAL SAFETY LATELY SEEMS TO BE NEGLETED. PLEASE HELP ME FIGHT TO PETITION FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RENT CAPS TO HELP CONTROL THE INFLATION BURDENING MANY HONEST, HARDWORKING CALGARIANS.  BASICALLY, THIS CAUSE IS NOT ABOUT DONATIONS, PLEASE DON'T DONATE MONEY. ALL WE NEED IS YOU TO DONATE YOURSELF BY JOINING THE CAUSE WHICH HELPS US SHOW FACES AND NAMES OF HONEST, GOOD PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THIS ON-GOING FIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS IN A RICH-MAN'S WORLD.

1. MAKE RENT AFFORDABLE FOR THE HARDWORKING MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASS CALGARIANS, NOT JUST THE RICH MINORITY.

2. SHOW LANDLORDS, TENANTS DO MATTER.

3. DOWN WITH GREED AND SLUMLORDS.

4. RENT CAPS, AND AFFORDABLE LIVING SOLUTIONS</description>
