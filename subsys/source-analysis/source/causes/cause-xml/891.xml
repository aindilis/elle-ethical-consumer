  <description>My name is Chet Bednar and this fall I am running a marathon in Dublin Ireland for The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. My goal is to raise $5,200 for the society to help find a cure for cancer. 

My honored hero is Maia, a little girl of 8 years who was diagnosed with blood cancer last year. 

Help me find a cure for cancer by supporting my race.
