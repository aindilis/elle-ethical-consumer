  <description>The Fairness Doctrine, once vetoed by President Ronald Reagan, is back on the Democrat's drawing table.  This doctrine calls for equal time on opinion-based radio talk shows, but in reality will abolish any talk radio show that is not liberal.  

This doctrine is a violation of the First Amendment, in which it is stated that "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...."

If you're still skeptical that the Democrats aren't going to exploit this,  take this quote from a Nancy Pelosi staffer:
"Salem is a big target, but the big one is going to be Limbaugh. We know we can't shut him up, but we want to make life a bit more difficult for him." 

The Fairness Doctrine is nothing but a sign that liberals are losing in the battle of ideas, are unsuccessful on today's free market radio, and are simply attempting to strong arm themselves onto the market.



1. The Fairness Doctrine is a violation of the First Amendment.

2. Each and every radio talk show is entilted to its own opinion, and should not be forced to balance their opinion with an opposing one.

3. This Doctrine cannot be allowed to be considered constitutional, and we will stop at nothing to make sure that it isn't.</description>
