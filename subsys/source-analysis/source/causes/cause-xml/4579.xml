  <description>WHAT IS STOP THE TRAFFIK? 
A global coalition: 

Exposing people trafficking 
Leading governments to action 
Unlocking freedom 
STOP THE TRAFFIK, is a global coalition of organisations working together to fight against people trafficking; by raising awareness on a subject that is little known or understood STOP THE TRAFFIK will call for change and freedom.  There are currently over 300 member organisations, including businesses, faith groups, community groups and charities.  We aim to grow and build the coalition over the next year.  The four key areas that STOP THE TRAFFIK is focused on, are; advocacy, education, fundraising and freedom day.

Through advocacy and education, STOP THE TRAFFIK will demonstrate to the public ways in which they can get involved and help change peoples futures.  At the heart of the campaign is the Global Declaration Card, thousands of cards signed worldwide will be delivered to the United Nations; these aim to pressurise the U.N and individual governments to bring about a change in legislation and policies, resulting in protection from people trafficking.
