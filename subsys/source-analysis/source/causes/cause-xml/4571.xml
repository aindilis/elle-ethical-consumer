  <description>THE PROBLEM :
Malaria is a disease passed by mosquitoes to humans. Although it has been eliminated from the United States and many other regions, malaria is still a killer in Africa and Asia.

In Africa, more than 3,000 children die each day from malaria. That is one child every 30 seconds.

THE SOLUTION:
Bed nets are one of the most effective means of preventing malaria. Insecticide-treated bed nets provide a protective barrier around families, especially at night when malaria-carrying mosquitoes strike.

THE AMERICAN RED CROSS works with partners to distribute bed nets, and is mobilizing volunteers from its partner national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies to educate families and to ensure nets are used properly. [Dowload the Fact Sheet] 

BITE BACK:
Help provide bed nets and educate families in Africa.

For $10 you can purchase a bed net &#8211; including distribution, education, and monitoring and evaluation.
