  <description>In *trip has been postponed, date tba* we plan to spend a week touring in London, seeing the London Symphony, attending clinics at the Royal Academy, and performing. However, the majority of us come from average families and the trip expenses are a stretch for us. The cost is estimated to fall between 2-3 grand per person. As musicians, we already must cover the costs to participate in our school's music program, take lessons, and maintain our instruments in working order. 

The Chamber Orchestra is an out of class activity, we practice as a group once a week and also consist of smaller groups that practice separately such as quartets. We enrich our community by boosting the music program that everyone knows is struggling to stay afloat due to budget cuts and a decline in interest in classical music. We perform at the Poway Center for the Performing Arts and our highschool several times during the year and we participate in festivals. This year we are reaching out even deeper into the community with our plans to play at retirement homes and start after school programs at our local elementary schools. 

1. We will represent Poway, San Diego, California, and the US in London.

2. We are the future, show us the world.

3. Enrich your community, inspire culture!</description>
