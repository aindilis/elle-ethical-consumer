  <description>Division causes conflict, and conflict inhibits progress (unless the kind of progress you're looking for is enhancing a country's war machine).

Working together as a global community will yield more progress than we can even imagine. Sharing resources, research, and valuable minds will solve problems currently unsolvable.

We could allow the world to be divided. We could let the weak eliminate themselves. We could let starvation, overpopulation, and war kill off the causes of these problems...

Or we could work together to find a better solution - and there is ALWAYS a better solution.

1. The world must be unified under one government.

2. National divisions must be erased.

3. Religious divisions must be ignored.

4. Ethnic divisions must be embraced.

5. A government that is able to efficiently and safely moderate the entire world must be formed, first in theory, then in practice.</description>
