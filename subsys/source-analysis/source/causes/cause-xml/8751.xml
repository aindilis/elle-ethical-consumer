  <description>Do you enjoy making bold statements of intent but lack the determination and dedication to turn words into action? Are you content with making promises and breaking them within a few minutes? Do you delight in grandiose platitudes but shy away when presented with real opportunities to do something meaningful?

2. Joining a cause never helped anybody.

3. This is all pretty much pointless.</description>
