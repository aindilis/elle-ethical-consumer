  <description>The Ohio Folklore and Legend Society is dedicated to smoking, eating Taco Bell, scaring teenagers and chasing old men.  Our mission is to travel around, talk to ghosts and set their spirits free.  We will be visiting an ancient Tuberculosis clinic in the far off land of Kentucky in the year 2008 to free all of the trapped spirits who have endured centuries of agonizing after life.  Joining this cause means that you too can be involved in setting the tortured souls trapped in this hell of a universe free!  

1. Trapped Spirits deserve to be free!

2. Trapped cigerettes deserve to be smoked!

3. Tuberculosis is an awful infectious disease that still plagues in the after life.</description>
