  <description>The Church of Trevorism is an ancient congregation first established in the 3rd century PE (Post Enlightenment) by the first Trevor Massey.

Since then the small church has maintained a small congregation located primarily in Western Canada and the United States.  As the only organized religion with the true secrets of Enlightenment it attracts a wide variety of persons to it's ranks.  Unfortunately it is slowly being destroyed by the rampant unchecked spread of Atheism, and it's holy war with Scientology.

Help save Trevorism and spread it's message of enlightenment.

Notice:  Currently seeking Disciples and Apostles.
Also hiring prophets.
