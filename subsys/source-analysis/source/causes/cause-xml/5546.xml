  <description>At Autism Speaks Canada our goal is to change the future for all who struggle with autism spectrum disorders.

We are dedicated to raising funds within Canada to support global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments, and cure for autism; to raising public awareness about autism and its effects on individuals, families, and society; and to bringing hope to all who deal with the hardships of this disorder. 


Autism Speaks Canada aims to bring the Canadian autism community together as one strong voice to urge the government and private sector to listen to our concerns and take action to address this urgent global health crisis. It is our firm belief that, working together, we will find the missing pieces of the puzzle.
