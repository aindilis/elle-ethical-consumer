  <description>We Miss you 2006 turned out to be more than we could ever have dreamt of or imagined. It was a Multi-sensory experience in which the teenagers from Quincy Illinois invited you to come and take a stand against a horrible disease. We raised over $2500 and 8&#8217; of hair for Locks of Love. We rocked out for 14 hours straight and had a lot of fun doing so.  On July 28th, 2007 we promise to do it for you all over again, and it may be even better. We will bring you music and food, nice people and even better atmosphere. There will be stylists taking donations for Locks of Love and your favorite local bands providing music all day long.  But the focus of the day will be that someone dies every 55 seconds from this horrible disease. Until that number reaches 0 we&#8217;ll keep on singing.

1. No one deserves to die from cancer.

2. No one deserves to lose someone to cancer.</description>
