  <description>Oblivion started as a zine in 1995 and is now a nonprofit youth rights organization. We are a 501c3 tax-exempt organization.

Oblivion's official mission statements reads: "To educate about and encourage involvement in issues affecting youth."

We depend on an entirely volunteer "staff" composed primarily of teens. We are always looking for people to send us youth rights news and articles they've written.

We do not currently sell any advertising, print or online. If we do sell advertising in the future, we won't sell it to you if you suck. So don't ask, you third-world-child-abusing, give-nothing-back-to-the-youth corporate bastards.
