  <description>The National Youth Rights Association (NYRA) defends the civil and human rights of young people in the United States through educating people about youth rights, empowering young people to work on their own behalf and taking direct steps to lessen the burden of ageism. We believe certain basic rights are intrinsic parts of American citizenship and transcend age or status limits.

NYRA is a national youth-led organization with over 10,000 members and chapters in a dozen states. We support lowering the voting age, lowering the drinking age, repealing government curfews, protecting student rights and fighting age discrimination.

2. lower the voting age
