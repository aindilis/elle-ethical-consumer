  <description>This cause is for changing the Red Cross's policy of not allowing any male who has engaged in a sexual act with another male since 1977 to donate blood. 

1. All of the blood donated to the Red Cross is checked for HIV/AIDS. Straight people can get HIV/AIDS just as easy as homosexuals.

2. Since the discovery/awareness of HIV/AIDS has come about, the percentage of homosexual males with AIDS has decreased significantly and is almost equal to infected straight men.</description>
