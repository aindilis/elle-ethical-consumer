  <description>My Cause is simple.. It is simply the most unique cause that most Lebanese Should be focusing on, instead of all that Political and Sectarian illusion that has been marketed by our leaders for the past 30 or 40 years...

I believe that we should start thinking of Lebanon first and forget all the fake routes that our leaders and political parties are drawing for us..

I am 33 years old now and don't remember in my near or far memory any moment where one's prime target was Lebanon.. 

The LBC add about the nationalities was simply the sad truth about all of us.. the sects of Lebanon!

1. Stop following Leaders bluntly!

2. Love Lebanon... and all Lebanese...

3. Start Action Plan</description>
