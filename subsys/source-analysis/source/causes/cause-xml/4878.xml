  <description>Nearly 400,000 people over a course of only a few years have been brutally slaughtered in the Darfur region of Sudan. The killers? The janjaweed militia, an arab led force. They're supporters? Unofficially, the Government of Sudan. The victims? The citizens of the region - killed because of their race. Every 2 months over 100,000 people are being killed or displaced. 

Now here is the scary part.

This genocide has been going on for years. There is absolutely NO peacekeeping force in Darfur. Granted, the Sudan Governments banned any peacekeeping force to enter. The United Nations are Darfurs' last hope - its time to force our way in. 

This group is an Advocacy Group. The more members the better. When we send petitions to the United Nations to go in to Darfur, all the members of this group will be represented in the mix. 

All donations you make will be sent to the "Save Darfur" Coalition. The money is worth it. No matter how small a donation, it will undoubtedly make an impact. Its time we as humanity came together to help the less fortunate. They deserve it.
