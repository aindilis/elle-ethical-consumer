  <description>A movement of Palestinians, Israelis, and global activists driven by an unflinching commitment to the non-violent struggle for a single, democratic, multi-ethnic state in Israel-Palestine. 

1. Israel and Palestine are synonymous and refer to the same geographical region.

2. The current reality of Israel-Palestine is one of institutionalized, government-sanctioned apartheid and ethnic cleansing.

3. Apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and violence will perpetuate until partition ends. 

4. A new reality of one democratic, multi-ethnic state is the only ethical and just solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.

5. A joint non-violent movement led by Palestinians and Israelis, supported by global activists, can bring about the essential changes neccessary for peace and justice in the region.

6. Anything less than a full end to partition will condone ethnic cleansing and ethnic segregation.

7. A new Law of Return, which allows Jews as well as Palestinian refugees to return to their shared homeland, must be invoked.</description>
