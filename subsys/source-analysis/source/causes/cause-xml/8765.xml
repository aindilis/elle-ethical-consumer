  <description>The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) helps people make choice that reduce their chances of developing cancer. 

We were the first cancer charity: 
To create awareness of the relationship between diet and cancer risk; to focus funding on research into diet and cancer prevention; and to consolidate and interpret global research to create a practical message on cancer prevention.  

Today the AICR continues: 
Funding research on the relationship of nutrition, physical activity and weight management to cancer risk; interpreting the accumulated scientific literature in the field; and educating people about choices they can make to reduce their chances of developing cancer.
