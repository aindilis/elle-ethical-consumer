  <description>Are you sick of turning on the TV and seeing death and destruction? Instead of ignoreing it, it's about time for people to reolize what this world is comming to. Imagine a world where people appreciate each other for who they are. Where people no longer wish to hurt one another. Is it impossible? Only one way to find out. Take a stand and change the world, one person at a time.
