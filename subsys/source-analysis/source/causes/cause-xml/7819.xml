  <description>This cause is dedicated to spreading awareness and formulating methods that will work to end the deplorable state of pylons in this country.  Members of this group feel that it is essential that the current dearth of pylons be remedied, and that approaches be formulated to do so.  Current ideas revolve around "constructing" "additional" pylons, although other theories are in the works.

1. Our current level of pylons is insufficient.

2. Additional pylons must be constructed.

3. YOU must construct additional pylons.</description>
