  <description>This cause's mission is to establish a community on Facebook of people dedicated to destroying stereotypes and looking at each other as one community.  This means NO racism, NO ageism, NO sexism, NO anti-gay/anti-hetero, NO biases.  Each person is their own person with their own unique gifts and talents, and you have no right to hold a predetermined opinion of them, nor should you.  Each person chooses his or her own lifestyle, and you should take a chance to give each person a chance before you pass judgment on them.  We are all one race, one family, and we should start to recognize this.  So let's stop the hate, and begin to see people as valued, no matter their history, background, skin color, gender, age, or orientation.

Everyone deserves a chance.

Invite your friends!  We need to get this message across.

1. Bias and stereotype is wrong and should be stopped.

2. Each person has the right to his or her own lifestyle.

3. Knowing a person rather than a first glance is necessary for judgment.

4. Each person has unique gifts that should not be neglected based on bias or lifestyle.

5. Acts of bigotry and hate, especially violent ones, are inherently wrong and should be stopped.

6. A community that recognizes this is needed in this world.</description>
