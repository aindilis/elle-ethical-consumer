Alberta Easter Seals is committed to helping children and their families overcome the challenges of a physical disability.  By providing families with necessary mobility and accessibility equipment, we can help ensure they live a better life.  In addition, money raised will help send over 1000 children with a serious illness or physical disability to Easter Seals Camp Horizon, where they enjoy a unique summer camp experience and succeed in ways they never imagined possible.

For more information about the Easter Seals Drop Zone 2007 Calgary, or to join us on Sep 6, 2007 8:00 AM, please visit www.thedropzone.ca.
 
Thank you for being a Superhero!
