  <description>Amnesty International is using satellite cameras to monitor highly vulnerable villages in war-torn
Darfur, Sudan. The human rights organization is inviting ordinary people worldwide to monitor 12 villages by
visiting the Eyes on Darfur project website (www.eyesondarfur.org) and put the Sudanese Government on
notice that these and other areas in the region are being watched around the clock.
