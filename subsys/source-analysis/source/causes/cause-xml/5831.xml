  <description>Hope Again for Lives Lost Already is a project undertaken by a group of committed individuals who recognize the fissures prevalent within society.  The endeavour of this project is to create positive ripples &#8211; which will not only purge undesired elements but also establish a new attitude towards issues and presently accepted sources of discrimination and prejudices against women.  

H.A.L.L.A stands as a personal initiative to make &#8216;HER&#8217; better, to make sure she arrives safely into this world and is given her liberty to live in tranquillity.  Life is the triumph she yearns that we as society deny.  H.A.L.L.A is working towards ensuring she is triumphant.  &#8216;She&#8217; is missing because she has been lost to the millions who submerge her and deny her right to live in freedom, and experience every moment that she craves for during her lifetime.  Help &#8216;HER&#8217; find herself towards civilization.  

H.A.L.L.A is working towards rediscovering the priceless spaces that have been denied to women thus far.  The project looks towards helping &#8216;HER&#8217; to relocate herself, her identity, her dreams, her desires, her life!
