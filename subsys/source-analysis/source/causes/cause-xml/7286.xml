  <description>Our programs provide an outlet for creative self-expression, a means to learn new skills, and a venue through which children faced with serious medical challenges can tell their personal stories.

Our flagship program, MovieMakers is a digital video program that introduces basic film and editing techniques. Cognitive, social, and personal development competencies are cultivated through these sessions as kids collaborate on projects, learn to conceptualize and storyboard their own ideas, and experience each of the crewmembers' roles.
