  <description>Bright green. Hand-painted with love. The Bread for the City truck has something to say: &#8220;After 5 years of service, it&#8217;s time to retire!&#8221; Since the truck started working at Bread for the City, we have provided more than 5,436,510 meals and 598,154 articles of clothing to low-income DC residents.

Our truck is nearing the end of the road and it cannot retire until we have secured a replacement. We need $31,080 to buy a new truck, so we are calling once again on the generosity of our community to contribute to the Bread for the City Truck Fund.

Just in case the message was slow getting out, we painted a driving billboard on the side of the truck:
DONATE to the Truck Fund TODAY at www.breadforthecity.org.
