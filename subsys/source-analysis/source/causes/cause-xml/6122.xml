  <description>for many people in this cause growing up as kid's was anything but normal. some of us were beaten and other molested in our early years. many of us myself included have had to learn life lesson's the hard way. many of us had to become adult's long before it was our time to be adults. making decisions as a child of wear we would live we had to make choices that we never should have had to do but we did. 
i have created this cause for people to join and have a voice to finally speak back and maybe for once be heard and i don't no maybe just maybe change the ripples of time and break the chains that bound us to our past.
