  <description>The Gambia is a tiny coastal nation in West Africa that suffers from a number of development challenges.  

The Njau Recycling and Income Generating Group is a co-operative of 100+ working together to clean up the littered villages and better the health conditions for animals and children, as well as provide an opportunity for women with little or no education to earn an income and be able to send children to school, support families, and improve their standard of life.  

Through the Skills Centre, they host education classes and produce recycled and handmade products.  Classes range from literacy to environment.  Products include recycled coin purses, cosmetic and shoulder bags, tie dye and loomed clothing, beaded jewelry, and other assorted handcrafts.

The women of Njau, headed by Project Manager Isatou Ceesay, hope to open an online Etsy store soon.  Like us and watch for it!

1. Gambians need the opportunity to relieve themselves from poverty, especially women.

2. Cultural friendships between underdeveloped and developed countries, as well as Muslim and Christian peoples is especially important now.

3. Fair Pay, Safe Working Conditions, and Children's Education is important for all and especially for Gambian women.

4. The environmental degredation and lack of waste management in West Africa must be addressed with immediate, creative solutions.</description>
