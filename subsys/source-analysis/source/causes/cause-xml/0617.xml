  <description>There are hundreds of charities and non-profits in our society today - all striving to serve one purpose: to make the world a better place to live.
However, many of them do not have the funds, resources, or the time to create and distribute valuable information about their program, and their goals and missions. In a society based largely on technology, these charities are left helpless, and are not given the opportunity to fulfill their goals to make our Earth a better place to live in.

Element Enterprises strives to create stunning multimedia media, such as brochures, flyers, videos, slideshows, websites, etc. in order that the charities will be able to get thier message across.
This service is currently offered free to local agencies, and is referred to as "e.squared technical support"

For every dollar that you donate to this group, I'll know that someone is being helped, and with that satisfaction, I can keep doing what I do best to support the charities that ultimately save the world.

1. Charities do not have funds to sustain their own technical support.

2. Many technicians have a vast knowledge of hardware, and basic business software such as spreadsheets, but do not have a creativity or design background.

3. Technology is very essential to get the message across to today's growing technology community.</description>
