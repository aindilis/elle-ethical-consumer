  <description>LiNK, or Liberty in North Korea, is the only full-time grassroots organization in North America devoted to the North Korean humanitarian and refugee crisis. We rescue and shelter refugees hiding in the underground in Asia, and provide educational and financial assistance for those who have been resettled in the US and South Korea. LiNK also raises awareness of the North Korean humanitarian, human rights and refugee crisis through documentary screenings and national tours.
