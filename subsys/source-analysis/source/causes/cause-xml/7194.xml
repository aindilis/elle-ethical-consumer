  <description>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is one of several names given to a poorly understood, highly debilitating disorder of uncertain etiology, which is thought to affect approximately 4 per 1,000 adults in the United States and other industrialized countries, and a smaller fraction of adolescents.

The disorder is marked by severe, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, arising in a previously healthy and active person, as well as other specific symptoms. Despite promising avenues of research, there remains no objective assay or pathological finding which is widely accepted to be diagnostic of CFS, and it remains a diagnosis of exclusion, made on the basis of patient history and symptomatic criteria. Although there is agreement on the genuine threat to health, happiness, and productivity posed by CFS, various physicians' groups, researchers, and patient activists champion very different nomenclature, diagnostic criteria, etiologic hypotheses, and favored treatments, resulting in ongoing controversy about nearly all aspects of this enigmatic disorder.
