  <description>I'm starting this organization just to show that not all people who love cats are scary little shut-ins. It's mainly for people under 35, and who are still active in certain things like the bar scene, skaters, bladers, construction workers... you get the point. You must also not think that cats are the most precious things on earth. Cats are independant, psychotic, neurotic, egotistical, lazy,  evil little clawballs that use people like their slaves. If you share my outlook on cats and still like them, feel free to sign up and show your support. And if you feel like donating, all profits go to Alley Cat Allies, an organization for helping abused and homeless cats. There are too many people out there who don't understand cats and think they make good kicking targets or worse.

1. You don't have to be and elderly shut-in to appreciate cats

2. Cats are one of the most evil, lazy, neurotic things on earth</description>
