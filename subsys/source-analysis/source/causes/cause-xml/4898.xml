  <description>The Mprize competition is a proven method for directly accelerating the development of revolutionary new life extension therapies by awarding two cash prizes: one to the research team that breaks the world record for the oldest-ever mouse; and one to the team that develops the most successful late-onset rejuvenation. Previous winners have already proven that healthy life can be extended; each new winner pushes the outer limits of healthy life back even further...and each new winner takes us even further.


1. Encourage new levels of excellence and specific innovations in longevity science

2. Dramatically increase the pool of potential solvers by marshalling the most diverse possible group of talent, approaches, and techniques

3. Replace the commonly accepted notion that the diseases of aging are inevitable with a desire to live longer and healthier lives</description>
