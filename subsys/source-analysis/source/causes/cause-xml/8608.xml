  <description>For those of you who don't know, my father is gay.  Recently he and his partner have had a civil union and are recognized as civil partners in the state of NJ, and therefore spouses.  Yet UPS is denying my father's partner the rights as the spouse of an employer.  This is completely unfair!  If you have any ideas as to what we might be able to do to make it known that we believe this is unfair and wish to help them fight for their rights as a human being, then join.
