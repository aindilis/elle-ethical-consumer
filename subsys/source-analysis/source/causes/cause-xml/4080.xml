  <description>      I am walking in The 3-Day walk in San Diego, CA. The 3-Day walk is made up of 60 miles where people from all over and come together to walk for the cause to find a cure for breast cancer. All walkers must raise $2,200! All proceeds go to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the National Philanthropic Trust, funding important breast cancer research, education, screening, and treatment. 
     This year I am walking with my mom and her team in San Diego for the 3-Day walk. Our team name is N.B.L.B., no boob left behind. :) they like to put a little fun into the walk. They started in Atlanta three years ago and this past year Arizona. My mom was unable to walk in Arizona because she was receiving her last treatment for breast cancer. 
      I am very excited about supporting a cause that means so much to my family and me. Please take just a few minutes and visit my webpage and make a little donation to a great cause.
Thank you so much!
