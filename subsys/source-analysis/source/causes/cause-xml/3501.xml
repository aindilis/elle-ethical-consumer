  <description>We have helped more than 6,900 families of missing children, counseling them on ways to find their children and work with law enforcement.&#160;We make and distribute posters of missing children for these families, and have a national eVolunteer force that distributes posters of missing children in their communities. Our hotline has been answered 24/7 since 1993.

We publish and distribute child safety information to people around the world. Our free Child Safety Kit and Internet Safety Kit can be ordered or downloaded online.

We also promote child safety legislation like Amber Alerts.

The Polly Klaas&#174; Foundation is dedicated to the safety of all children.

The Polly Klaas&#174; Foundation is a member of the Association of Missing and Exploited Children's Organizations (AMECO).
