  <description>why should animals suffer for what people can stop if they listen to save the environment .... well atleast what we have left. Think of all the animals we can save if we ban hunting, the environment will have a meaning to those who care instead of being ripped down to build cities which will eventually KILL us all.

1. treat animals the same as people you love

2. even killing an animal in general is cruel !</description>
