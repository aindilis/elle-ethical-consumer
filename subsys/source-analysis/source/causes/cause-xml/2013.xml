  <description>This cause is to aid and support the brilliant University of Waterloo undergraduate student, Peter Kao, in attaining wealth and power so he can rule the universe.

The donated sum will be used to feed him and shower him with lavish possessions that he will use to entertain himself and those around him. He will also use the donated aid to construct a research facility that follows no regulations and is completely unrestricted. There, he will become the head visionary and lead the planet Earth and its inhabitants to universal domination and glory by creating new technologies. He will then use the technologies to create an empire of which he will have the throne accompanied by a beautiful woman (it can even be YOU, ladies). The empire front will be a series of companies, but in the back-end it will naturally become the new world government.

Please support the 'PK New World Order' by donating money to him whenever you see him.

Remember - even a dollar a day can help!
