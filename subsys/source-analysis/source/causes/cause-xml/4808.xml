  <description>Sami Al Haj
 
Sami Al-Hajj, prisoner 345 at the United States Detainment Center in Guantanamo Bay Cuba, has been on hunger strike since 7th January, 2007. He was released on 2.May.2008 after being wrongfully held for 6 years.  Let us pray for the rest, may they be reunited with their families soon.

Sami was arrested in Pakistan in December 2001 whilst travelling with a legitimate visa to work in Afghanistan as a cameraman for Al Jazeera. But he is being held as an &#8216;enemy combatant&#8217;.

prisoner345.net is dedicated to empowering Sami&#8217;s family, friends and colleagues, together with all supporters of human rights around the world, in the campaign to set him free.
