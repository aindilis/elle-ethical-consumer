  <description>In simple words, "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints". In reality this illness is separation from normal life, inability to perceive world as people without it. One lives with a constant pain, which no one else can understand. There are many semi-medications, temporary cures which all present a short relief. Others are life-threatening and not fully researched. Let's put the wheels in motion and support a freedom of motion!

1. No one should live in constant pain

2. Medications and therapies should be available for everyone

3. One should be able to move when and how they wish, not must! </description>
