  <description>this cause was brought up because most people from another states still point out at Arabs and Muslims as terrorists, and accuse Muslims of spreading fear and sharing faith while using forces, n leaving no choice for women, while we have less prostitution rates than they already do, and our school drop outs are less, and so as raping n murder...
Terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation to achieve political ends.
it attempts to change the way the government thinks, and their plan is to terrorize people to behave the way they want them to.
This is all NOT allowed in our religion Islam
Islam is all about peace , but you cannot stop interpreting our nationalities and religion from a narrow-minded point of view.. you seriously need to wake up.
have you forgotten what your countries have done to us ... have you forgotten Palestine ? and how it all started ? 
Go educate your selves before judging us based on your ignorant media-based "facts" 
if you're that interested and judgmental go read and seek for knowledge and information about us. 
you cannot just take a handful of bad or harmful people and judge their whole community based on their action.
GOSH! DON'T YOU WANNA PUT AN END FOR THIS CRAP?!


1. Every community has its own good and bad side

2. We are not different than any other person

3. We need to start makin peace with the world 

4. Stop the narrow-minded opinions being listed as facts

5. Stop believing the media and know that ISLAM IS AGAINST TERRORISM</description>
