  <description>Our country is soon to head in the same direction as Zimbabwe itself and other african states, we need to stand together and make a change, for it will be our own faults for standing by and watching our own country fall apart around us and letting those who call themselves government get richer as they run our country into the ground as their own personal company.

This cause is a call for all those that see what is truely happening and want a change, to group up and make one..!


1. A country is run for the betterment of its people and not for individuals!!!</description>
