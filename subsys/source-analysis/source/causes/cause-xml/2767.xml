  <description>Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological disorders. While it is more common for women in their 20s and 30s to have the disease, endometriosis can affect women at any time during their childbearing years. In fact, it is estimated that 5.5 million women in North America are affected by endometriosis.

In addition to causing chronic pelvic pain in millions of women and teens, the disease is also a leading cause of female infertility.    Studies have also shown an elevated risk of certain cancers and autoimmune disorders in those with Endometriosis.     Currently, Endometriosis can only be definitively diagnosed via surgery, and there is no absolute cure.

Some Facts:
Endometriosis can affect women and teens of all ages, even those as young as 10 and as old as 85.

Hysterectomy, menopause and pregnancy are NOT cures for Endometriosis; in fact, there is no definitive cure.

Delayed childbearing is NOT what causes Endometriosis; in fact, no one really knows for sure what causes the disease, but research points to multi-factorial origins like heredity, immunology and exposure to environmental toxicants.

Endometriosis can ONLY be diagnosed via surgery; diagnostic tests like MRIs and ultrasounds are not definitive.
