  <description>Operation Wake-Up is a brand new cause dedicated to helping underprivileged kids gain a future.  Many of these children face home lives where no one cares about them.  They are the ones responsible for making sure their needs are met.  So we have stared Operation Wake-Up so kids who don't have anyone to wake them up in the mornings or who don't have a reason to get up, will now have a reminder that there is a whole world out there waiting for them.  We are collecting alarm clocks and clock radios to give to these children, to activate them into purposeful lives.  The purpose of this is for these kids who have to do it all themselves can 1) feel pride-in-ownership in having something just for them and 2) they can wake themselves up in the morning for school, daycare, or work.

E-mail me for address to send clocks.
