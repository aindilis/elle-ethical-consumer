  <description>Dear friends - WE NEED TO MAKE HISTORY!!!- 
 
Vote for the Taj Mahal to be one of the NEW Seven Wonders of the World @ www.new7wonders.com Voting is very simple!

15 days left to vote!! Voting ends on 07/07/07
 
Apparently the Taj Mahal isn't even in the top 10 at present!! If it doesn't get enough votes, it won't be included as a one of the new wonders!
 
Contrary to popular belief, the Taj Mahal is NOT one of the original Seven Wonders. The original were named in 200 BC and only the Egyptian Pyramids remain in existence. 
 
Do your part for history and vote for one the most beautiful structures ever built!! 
 


1. The Taj Mahal is one of the most fastinating man-made structures ever built. It needs to be recognised

2. Thousands of workers worked tirelessly to create it; some lost their lives. Give their efforts recognition

3. The Taj Mahal is the world's symbol of Love. It must be remembered</description>
