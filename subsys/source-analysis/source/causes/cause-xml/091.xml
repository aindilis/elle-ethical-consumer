  <description>The biggest losers in free trade agreements are often small farmers, put out of business by the dumping of subsidized foods on local markets by big agriculture firms.  Millions of subsistence farmers who depend on small-volume sale of surplus product to provide for necessities like education, medical care and water are left with no means to provide for these basic human needs.  None of our interests are served by thrusting these people deeper into poverty. To defend these small farmers, we must reject so-called Free Trade Agreements that put corporate interests ahead of those of the poor.

1. Trade should benefit all in society, not just big businesses

2. Poverty isn't reduced by eliminating farmers' livelihoods

3. Free Trade Agreements that threaten small farmers must end.</description>
