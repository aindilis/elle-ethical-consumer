  <description>The Miami Institute for Latin American Studies is a pilot summer program in Miami-Dade that strives to give students a more in-depth understanding of Latin American culture, history and its politics.

We would like High-school Students interested in learning about Latin American studies, and incorporating the discipline in the public schools curriculum.

We want to change the Miami-Dade curriculum by adding a Latin American Studies class that will talk about the history, culture, and politics, for it will create an awareness of their history, culture, and politics because the majority of Miami-Dade is made up of people with Latin American origins.

This is not only a pilot program for Latin America but for the many other cultures that have been over looked in our schools curriculum.

1. We should have Latin American Studies in our school

2. Having Latin American Studies will only be the starting point of having many classes dedicated to the many cultures of the world

3. High school students should learn about their country.  Its history, culture, and politics</description>
