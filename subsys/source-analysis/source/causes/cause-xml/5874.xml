  <description>In response to God's call to justice, the Inner City Christian Federation provides housing opportunities and services that encourage family responsibility and independence, thereby helping to build stable communities.

The Inner City Christian Federation is a non-profit housing corporation whose leadership is motivated, and programs shaped by, the belief that all people deserve safe, clean, affordable housing; our response to God's desire that we seek justice in our communities, our grateful response to the saving love of Jesus Christ, and our desire to have others see his love in action.

1. We believe all persons are created in God's image and exist in the light of his love.

2. We encourage the pursuit of opportunities to build skills and acquire new abilities that will increase housing independence and promote other life accomplishments.

3. Our services shall promote social justice and economic justice for all. </description>
