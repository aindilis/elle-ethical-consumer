  <description>The grous of people that we help are:
-Orphans whose parents have died of AIDS
-those who are so poor that they can barely survive and have no chance of an education

We send those who qualify to commercial boarding schools and the others to training centers to learn trades.

We need to provide a place to stay, for most, because travel is difficult and unaffordable.

Those who get sick in boarding school are dismissed from the school and (those we support) need a place to go and get basic nursing care.

The Foothill Uganda Club now has a &lt;a href=www.myspace.com/ugandaclub&gt;myspace&lt;/a&gt;! So add it if you want! 

And just a note: The Kathleen Education Project is the organization that Uganda Club sends it's money with. So it doesn't matter if you send donations through Uganda Club or directly to the organization, it'll get there both ways! :]


Have a nice day guys!



1. Everyone deserves an education.

2. Victims of AIDS should not lose hope.

3. Money should not keep people from having an education.</description>
