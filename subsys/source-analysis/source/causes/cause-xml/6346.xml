  <description>This charity is to fund my travels around the world.

I aim to help different causes that matter to me!





So far I have taken part in:

The African Lion Rehabilitation Project, Zimbabwe:
The world&#8217;s leading programme for the release of lions back into the wild. Here I was working as a volunteer based in Victoria Falls.

Over 200,000 lions used to roam the African continent, as recently as 1975. The latest estimates show an 80 &#8211; 90% population decline in the last 30 years. The end objective of the Victoria Falls lion project, along with the Antelope Park programme, is the reintroduction of the offspring of captive-bred lions into the wild by means of a four-stage process.





Other trips that I would like to partake in within the next 6 months:
Working with orphans in Mombassa, Kenya/ and also in Malawi
Sea turtle conservation project in Costa Rica
Community Development in Mexico/ Brazil



I know I'm not going to change the world, but every little helps. If every person tried to make a difference then the world would be a better place.



Thanks    :]


1. We must "make poverty history" - it will not magically go away

2. Animal cruely must end immediately

3. Millons of children are starving in Africa. We need to do something about it.</description>
