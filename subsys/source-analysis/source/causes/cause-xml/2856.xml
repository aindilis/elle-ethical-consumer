  <description>The Cure Is Knowledge stands to eliminate destructive elements from our close society; the instances in which we find moral and physical impurities. In either occurence, our generation has a great deal of responsibility that we must rise to. We have an obligation to ourselves and to our loved ones, to live honestly and healthily, to the best of our ability. For many, we are fully able. However, we choose to neglect a set of issues that in turn create complex dilemmas in our social circles and concerning our physical health. 

The greatest prospect in our search for a cure is prevention. By early dectection through physical education today, we can dismiss the chance for cancer to occur tomorrow. Our mass involvement - our many hands working together is the solution to critical health issues. Together we can show that physical education in high schools, specifically targeting prevention methods and encouraging healthy lifestyles, ought to be a given in any curriculum. Our lives are priceless. By this, we grant that The Cure Is Knowledge does not acknowledge financial contribution by its participants but it does endorse the integration of this specific education into school budgets. 

The Cure Is Knowledge is the focus of Skate 4 Cancer. Your involvement is far more valuable than any amount of money we could ever raise.
