  <description>There are people in this world that aren't able to eat every day. All you have to do is donate a little money or donate some non parishable items to a local cherity place. Some families have a bunch of family members to feed and no money to put food on the table. Yet, we sit here woth kitchens full of food that could be donated, but choose not to. Well, all you have to do is donate atleast one thing...everything helps!

1. We all need to help those in need!

2. Everything helps!</description>
