  <description>In 2006, through the generous support of our friends and partners, Joyce Meyer Ministries served more than 11 million meals to some of the poorest families and children in nations like Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Swaziland and Vietnam. And this number continues to grow each year.

In addition to providing nutritious meals six days a week, we also supply children with the basics of a good education and teach them how to read and write...skills that will give them greater opportunity to have a better life in the future. And most importantly, we teach them all about Jesus Christ, their true source of hope for a better tomorrow.

Through your support we can continue feeding the hungry around the world and also reach thousands of other precious children...children who don't know where their next meal is coming from...children who desperately need our help.

2. 150 million children around the world live on the streets.

3. 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day, making access to medical care impossible.

4. Thousands of prisoners live without hope.

5. Tsunamis, hurricanes, and natural disasters have increased and devastated.</description>
