  <description>We, at the Hasmonean Boys Sixth Form, are running a project in which we are going to collect stationery to donate to impoverished communities in Kenya, Tanzania and other African countries. At the moment they do not have the equipment which is essential for their education. Without proper schooling it is impossible for there to be any real economic development in this region.

In order to acquire sufficient stationery we need to raise money from as many sources as possible. Hopefully, through this website, you can help us raise that little bit extra which can be added to the money already raised. The money raised will be subsequently used to buy the stationery in bulk. After this, we will send all of the stationery to the communities in Africa mentioned above.
