  <description>Relay For Life&#174;
One day. One night. One community. Your Relay For Life&#174; is about celebration, remembrance, and hope. By participating, you honor cancer survivors, pay tribute to the lives we've lost to the disease, and raise money to help fight it &#8211; all right here in your community. You won't want to miss one moment of this life- and community-affirming event! This is a 24 hour event designed to honor those battling cancer, remember those lost, and to raise money in order to fund research to find a cure.
