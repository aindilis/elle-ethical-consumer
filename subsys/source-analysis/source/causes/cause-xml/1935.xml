  <description>Each summer, nearly 80 students from universities across Japan and the United States convene to discuss some of the hottest topics facing the two nations.  The program alternates host countries each year giving students the rare opportunity to see places, whether at home or abroad, and learn about their culture through the eyes of others.

From politics to pop culture and everything in between, JASC offers motivated university students of all levels an outlet for ambition, intellect, and cultural stimulation.

Not only do conference participants learn about one of the world&#8217;s most strategic bilateral alliances, they also have the opportunity to directly help reinforce the bonds between countries by sharing knowledge and experiences while making memories and friendships with other future leaders. 

1. Our student-run cross-cultural programs inspire future leaders to improve international mutual understanding, resulting in a more peaceful world.

2. We believe in the importance of developing mutual understanding and friendship as the path to peace.

3. We believe in the power of an open mind and a willingness to exchange opinions in building a respect for differences.

4. We believe in the unique ability of students, with their idealism, enthusiasm and vitality, to plan and implement peace-building events and activities

5. We believe in the imperative of investing in the present to positively transform the future.</description>
