  <description>What most people don&#8217;t know is that people are dying all over the world and we don&#8217;t do anything to help. We do send a little bit of food and water the most likely place but, what about the other places in the world, like china, Indonesia, South America. All countries have a rich and a poor side but know one knows that. People are dying each day and we only do a little bit to help. We (Canada) have so much to offer but we don&#8217;t and that makes me mad.
