  <description>Socialist Network raises money to put back into the community. The money will go Bahia Street, a Brazilian based programme working end poverty and violence towards women through education and opportunity. Bahia also works out of UK and USA in addition to Brazil. We will work to raise money to redistribute it where it is needed most: to the underprivileged members of the community, in this case Afro-Brazilian girls.

We will work to raise money to bridge the gap between the rich and poor by community based action. We will work to redistribute wealth and power and provide broad public access to housing, food and healthcare. We are a feminist anti-racist, anti-war organization working to bridge alliances and networks of support in our local communities and abroad.

1. Everyone should have food, shelter and adequate healthcare.

2. Community alliances and investment promotes peace, tolerance and acceptance.

3. Root causes of oppression will be addressed throughout our mission like, racism, sexism/transphobia, homophobia, classism, ableism etc.</description>
