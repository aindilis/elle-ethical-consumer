  <description>     South Deanery Dance Marathon is part of what has become the latest philanthropy on College Campuses. All over the nation, colleges and universities are establishing Dance Marathons to benefit the Children's Miracle Network. Our dance is simple - stay standing for 7 hours, not for fun alone, but for the Children at Riley who would do anything to have that opportunity. It really is "the chance of a lifetime to give a lifetime of chance." 
      All in all, the evening should be widely heartfelt and leave a lasting impact on your commitment to service. The Secound Annual South Deanery Dance marathon will be held sometime around the beginning of May. If you are intersted in helping please let me know.
     I have recieved alot of feedback and it was all good. With your help we can make the 2nd SDDM better than the first.

1. Every child deserves the best health care. 

2. We dance because we can, we stand for those who can't. </description>
