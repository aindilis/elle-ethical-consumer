  <description>This cause aims to raise awareness and funds for organizations that support collaborative cultural and other movements, such as open source and free software movements, movements for social justice, etc. We are working towards societies that are open for anyone to express themselves without domination or hindrance by others. This cause is U.S.-specific and donates to the Free Software Foundation, as one way to reclaim the commons, but other organizations and projects exist with similar areas of focus that may interest you including:

The Creative Commons www.creativecommons.org

Open Source Development Labs www.osdl.org

various political parties and movements in the US and elsewhere, and the list goes on. A little bit of hunting on the net will go a long way in this regard.

3. Collaborative efforts to practice and promote the arts and sciences must be actively encouraged by citizens and governments.</description>
