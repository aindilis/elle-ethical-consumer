  <description>In India, an estimated 10 million prostitutes are trapped in the sex trade industry.* Often, they are either sold against their will into slavery by boyfriends, husbands, or family members. Some are kidnapped through various means of deception, such as the promise of a better life.

God is using us to rescue, protect, and empower vulnerable children as our own. These children were born in the red light district or were living in extreme poverty where child trafficking is most prevalent. Many of these children have been removed from dangerous situations and welcomed into our loving family where they receive an English education, excellent care, and hear the truth of Jesus Christ.
