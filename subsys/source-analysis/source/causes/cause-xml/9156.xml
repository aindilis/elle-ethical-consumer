  <description>WorkUp is a national network of local projects that supports young adults in building individual and community assets and achieving social mobility. Launched in the nation's capital in November 2006, WorkUp now operates in Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington, DC and helps youth succeed in four foundational areas 
Economic security. Build financial assets through access to mainstream, fair-priced banking instruments and services.

Post-secondary education. Raise educational achievement through individual coaching, remedial instruction, test preparation, and financial aid opportunities.

Career advancement. Develop career paths that lead to living-wage jobs with benefits through professional and life-skills training.

Vibrant neighborhoods. Create social capital through youth-led social enterprises that engage and improve their local and global communities.
