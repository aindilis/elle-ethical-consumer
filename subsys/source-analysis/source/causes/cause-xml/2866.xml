  <description>Seeing as the NL First Party wants to become federally registered so that it's work may begin, the cause is to help the party get Federally Registered. From there, we can begin to get organized and begin to fundraise.

 And in doing so, we can be one step closer to a more autonomous NL!

1. take the time to visit http://www.nlfirst.ca and fill out a registration forum

2. check out the party blog at http://www.nlfirstpartyblog.blogpsot.com

3. Join the Facebook Group "The NL First Party Supporters Site"</description>
