  <description>Many people use these light bulbs in areas that are not commonly used. So, why spend money on those circular light bulbs in places you rarely use. 

Those circular light bulbs are too expensive for people to buy, and many people use them, but not everywhere. 

The government DOES NOT have the right to just band these incandescent light bulbs. What would happen to poor people that need light and can afford incandescent but not fluorescent? Would millions of citizens actually go and buy those fluorescent light bulbs or are those retailers just want the government to do this so they can earn more money? 

100% AGAINST BANNING INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULBS!!!!

1. Many people use these in areas that are rarely use. 

2. Too espensive to buy flourescent light bulbs. 

3. Politics will be against this. </description>
