  <description>The Glenfield Project supports over thirty families in the Leicester area by providing respite care for children with disabilities and special health care needs.

The Friends of the Glenfield Project raise funds to directly help the young people to have access to activities which the rest of us take forgranted.

In the past few years funds from the Friends of Glenfield have helped young people using the project to go to an outdoor activities centre in the Lake District, take part in a residential barge trip adapted for people using wheelchairs, helped some young people to go camping for the first time in Derbyshire, and go to various places they had never seen before such as London and Stratford.

1. Raise funds for the Glenfield Project

2. Directly benefit young people using the project

3. Help young people access services and activities they may not have used before

4. Don't send money to us through Facebook though, contact me directly</description>
