She is the only planet we have.  Our only home, our only land and sea and sky, the only earth which can hold us.  We profess to adore her beauty and grace, and yet we take her for granted.  We take from her repeatedly, and seldom, if ever, give.  We ignore her fears and shudders, her tremors of change, her obvious and unending pleas for help.  'We're still here, aren't we,' we say, as if being alive were enough to prove our faithfulness.  So if we love her, let's not just speak the words, let's take a vow.  And put that vow up for all to see.  Right now.  Right here.

By the way, the nonprofif benefitting right now is unrelated since Planetfesto is in the process of applying for nonprofit status.  So, if you'd like to make donations to Planetfesto directly, either hold off or send it directly to them:
