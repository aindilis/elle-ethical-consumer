  <description>Ron Ponder, my father-in-law, is riding his bike across the US (from Pacific to Atlantic) to raise money for the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which empowers those with cancer to help them win their fight.
Ron needs individuals and companies to make donations for this worthy cause.

Please go to http://www.apennypermile.com to donate to this worthy cause!  
(Don't donate through the facebook.)
