  <description>Fact: Joey has not gotten fatter in over four months.
Fact: Lack of nutrition is the leading cause of lack of weight gain in Joey Hassids.
Wandering center court during lunch, Joey often has no food to eat. Sometimes, he forgets his lunch money. Sometimes, he uses his lunch money during brunch, saving none for the larger and more vital meal. Sometimes, he is too preoccupied with other activities to remember. Sometimes, he has too much homework to finish to have the time to eat. The causes are many, but the problem is simple: Joey Hassid is hungry. His parched esophagus has not been touched by anything but saliva for hours. His small intestine squirms with angst, and his large intestine roars with agony. Despite repeated advocation for federal aide, Joey's local government has refused on multiple occasions to provide even the most rudimentary funding for the eradication of this disaster. Here at Feed the Joey, we'd like to end this madness. Make it history. The only thing is, we need your help.
Fact: With $3.00, Joey can buy a burrito feast and chocolate milk.
Fact: With $2.00, Joey can buy a bagel with cream cheese and chocolate milk. 
Fact: With just $1.00, Joey can buy a nutritious meal of BBQ kettle chips.
Join us. Together, we can fight this.
