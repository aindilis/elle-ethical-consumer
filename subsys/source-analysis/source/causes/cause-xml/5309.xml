  <description>This cause was created to make people aware of the suffering in Africa!!!! Skin colour should not be an issue! The US needs to do something to help these people out!!! Over 20 million people have died of AIDS, Malaira, Overpopulation, Fighthing, and Malnutrition! Millions more will die if something isn't done!! Please help the African people!

1. It's wrong to spend millions of dollars on silly things, when people in other countries are dying!

2. People should not be treated this way.

3. The death toll in Africa can stop going up, if someone lends a hand!</description>
