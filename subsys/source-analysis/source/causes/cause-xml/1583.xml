  <description>For the past 10,000 years, humans have been on a path to their own destruction.  Through totalitarian agriculture and the belief that there is only one right way to live, mankind has separated itself from nature, destroyed the planet, and is now paying the price.

While it is impossible for the people of modern society to return to the tribal way of life that sustained humans for hundreds of thousands of years, we need to make drastic changes if we are to survive.

Not only do we need social and political changes, but a complete paradigm shift to once again live in harmony with nature.  We need people like you, willing to imagine new ways of living, to think of alternatives to industrialized society, who want to make a difference.
