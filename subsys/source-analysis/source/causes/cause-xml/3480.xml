  <description>"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."

"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms."
-Thomas Jefferson

The right ranted to every citizen of the United States is under constant attack. Every day, the anti-gun lobby pressures Congress to pass legislation that would ban firearms, in all forms, from the hands of the average, law abiding, citizen. 

Recognizing the rights accorded to us by the Constitution, and the will of the Founding Fathers, we must do all we can to preserve the Second Amendment.

1. Prevent leislation that would deny a law-abidin citizen the right to own firearms.

2. Promote firearm safety.

3. Keep firearms OUT of the hands of criminals.</description>
