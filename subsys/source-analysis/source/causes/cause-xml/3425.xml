  <description>NRDC is the nation's most effective environmental action organization. We use law, science and the support of 1.2 million members and online activists to protect the planet's wildlife and wild places and to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all living things.

Worth Magazine has named NRDC one of America's 100 best charities, and Charity Navigator has given NRDC four stars (out of a possible four).

1. We work to restore the integrity of the elements that sustain life -- air, land and water -- and to defend endangered natural places.

2. We seek to establish sustainability and good stewardship of the Earth as central ethical imperatives of human society. 

3. We strive to protect nature in ways that advance the long-term welfare of present and future generations.

4. We work to foster the fundamental right of all people to have a voice in decisions that affect their environment.</description>
