  <description>Leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma are blood cancers that originate in the bone marrow or lymphatic tissue.  The injured cell becomes malignant and begins to multiply.  The accumulation of the malignant cells interferes with the production of healthy blood cells.  An estimated 785,829 Americans are living with blood cancers, and the number is growing continuously.  Leukemia causes more deaths than any other cancer in children and young adults.  75% of all funds raised goes directly to researching a cure.

I'll be running in the Nike Women's Half Marathon to benefit this cause.  Any help to reach my goal of $3,700 dollars would be greatly appreciated.  Of course, support of any kind wonderful!  Thank you!

1. Blood cancers need to be cured!

2. Survival rates for Leukemia and related blood cancers has improved significantly over the years, but the fight is far from over.  In 2002, the 5 year survival rate for myeloma was still at only 33%.</description>
