  <description>I have heard that the DEA intends to make all hemp products illegal, not just illegal, but criminal. This is ridiculous. Hemp is non-psychoactive and very useful. The constitution was written on hemp paper. America's soldiers in World War II used hemp ropes. Anyone who would criminalize hemp is himself a criminal, responsible for the crimes of assault and kidnapping. Kidnapping is a capital offense...

Even psychoactive marijuana, the cousin of industrial hemp, should be legal. We should be able to buy it in bulk in the grocery store for a few dollars an ounce. Marijuana is a useful medicine and is nearly harmless, much less harmful than either tobacco or alcohol. In all of recorded history, noone has ever died from an overdose of marijuana. I currently imbibe none of these substances in any quantity, but I have experience with all three, so I know.

Even if marijuana or hemp were harmful, government has no place attempting to protect people from themselves. The purpose of government is to preserve individual liberty. If you have forgotten this, read the Declaration of Independence. That document is the soul of America. Don't ever forget it.

The war on drugs has nothing to do with drugs. It is a war on freedom, a war on the Bill of Rights, a war on America's soul. End it. Completely. Now. The alternative is civil war. Soon.
