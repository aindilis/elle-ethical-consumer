  <description>My aim is to promote truthfulness, pride, and honor in politics by fighting the massive hypocrisy seen in U.S. politics today. 

Don't you find it ironic that Al Gore sees it fit to lecture the masses on consumption and eco-friendly policy while living like a spoiled brat in his 10,000 square foot mansion, consuming more energy in one month than the average family consumes in one calendar year? Or that still holds a plentiful amount of stocks in petroleum companies who wreak havoc on the envorinment on a daily basis?

Is it ironic that Hillary Clinton is one of the most outspoken opponents of "Bush's war on Iraq", even though she voted in favor of it?

We need to start holding our leaders accountable, and questioning the liberal media. If these political elitists cannot practice what they preach, we will not listen. Bring back dignity to politics, and stop the lies. 

1. Enforce a "practice-what-you-preach" policy for our political elites

2. Hold our leaders ACCOUNTABLE for what they say and do and vote on

3. Require opinionated media to be labled as just that, rather than fact</description>
