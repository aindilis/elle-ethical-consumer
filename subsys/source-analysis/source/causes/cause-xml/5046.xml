  <description>Well as you all know, i have been wanted a vw bus for as long as i can remember. I was not the kid who wanted the convertable, jaguar, or mustang. I want a classic vw bus.

many are familar with this dream i have. to one day obtain, this beauty.

although the only problem is the cost :( yes it costs more than i have expected plus with repairs it will be a doozy.

But by donating small ammounts my lifes goal will soon be closer.

With this money i shall buy my vw bus. paint it lime green. have the fuzzy purple letters on the side that say "Shag Wagon". and i will get the shag rug put in all over the inside of the car.

yes it is brilliant, and yes its my life's goal.

please help me...and i will probably love you forever.

1. They are fucking sweet

2. Everyone wants their dreams to come true

3. everyone who donates will be able to drive with me as much as they want.</description>
