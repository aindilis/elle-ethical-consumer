  <description>MD Schools Raise Money for Katrina Relief
(AP) Jessup, MD State education officials say efforts by public school students to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims has been a huge success. 

School Superintendent Nancy Grasmick had wanted each of the state's 900,000 public school children to give a penny for Katrina relief. That would yield $900,000. Officials say students raised much more than that. 

Grasmick will announce the fundraising total today when she visits the Bollman Bridge Elementary School in Jessup. Nearly half of the state's 1,300 public schools participated in the fundraising campaign.
