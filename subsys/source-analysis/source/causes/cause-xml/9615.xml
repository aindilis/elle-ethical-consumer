  <description>After the Great Mississippi Flood, in 1927, which cost more than a thousand lives and a billion dollars in damages, a massive network of levees was constructed in South Louisiana to tame the river's turbulent flow. The river had been constantly shifting to find the shortest distance to the ocean, thereby depositing a fan of rich sediment into the Gulf of Mexico. These levees, along with other man-made intrusions, have accelerated erosion in the Delta.

The coast of Southern Louisiana loses more than a football field of land each day. Cities like Thibodeaux, Houma, Grand Isle, and Franklin are already threatened, and Lake Charles and Lafayette could find themselves in trouble soon. additionally, without land barriers south of New Orleans to deplete storms, the city itself becomes more exposed to stronger Gulf storms.

With help from the Federal government and from private interests, the problem can be solved, and multiple cities can be saved. But we need to fix this problem now. 

1. The federal government is responsbile for aiding in th epreservation of the Louisiana coastline.

2. The preservation of the coast is essential for the continuing existence of major Louisiana cities and for the amelioration of the immediate effects of major tropical storms.</description>
