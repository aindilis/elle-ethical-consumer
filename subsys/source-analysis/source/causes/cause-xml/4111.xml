  <description>While it is true that Susan B. Anthony helped women obtain the right to vote, she was also an outspoken critic of abortion. 

The Susan B. Anthony List has fought against the heinous practice of abortion-on-demand in America that has claimed the lives of nearly 50 million victims since 1973.

In 1997, the Candidate Fund of the Susan B. Anthony List began helping pro-life women become elected officials in Congress. Additionally, the Fund has worked to defeat pro-abortion candidates.

This organization has 501(c)(4) membership and is connected with political action committee status.

Your donation will be sent directly to the Susan B. Anthony List foundation.

Please support  the fight against legalized murder. The future of America is counting on it.

Spread the word by inviting all of your friends to join this great Facebook Cause.

Thank you.
