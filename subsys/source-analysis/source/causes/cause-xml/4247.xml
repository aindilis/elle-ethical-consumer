  <description>In an inane attempt to stop terrorist from developing bombs /  rockets, now you must register to buy basic rocketry items.
In an attempt to stop people from creating meth, the state of Texas now requires you to register Erlenmeyer flaskes (1) , but not handguns  (2). 

Do these things make sense? No. For a long time, it has been an American coming of age event to get your first chemistry set. These kit came with dozens of chemicals that would allow young children to fuel their interest in science by watching changing colors and bubbling potions. But now the government is regulating so many "potentially harmful" chemicals that such kits have been reduced to only containing four or five compounds. 

Wake up America. America has stayed as a super power for a long time because of technology and science. Whats next, frisking kids as they leave chemistry class. This is getting out of hand.
