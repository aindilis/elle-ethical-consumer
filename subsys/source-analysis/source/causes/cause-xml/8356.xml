  <description>Hanna Clark is 4 years old. A little over a year ago, she was diagnosed with a form of Hepatitis and a liver condition. She was hospitalized for a little over a week. She has been on medication, the only treatment there is for her condition, since she was diagnosed. She continuosly has to go get blood drawn and be tested. She is a very fun, sweet, and loving child. She is very active, and loves to play. There is no telling when, or if, she will ever relapse and have to be hospitalized again. This walk is to raise money and awareness of liver conditions, and hopefully to find a cure.
