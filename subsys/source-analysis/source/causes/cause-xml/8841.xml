  <description>Epilepsy (sometimes referred to as a seizure disorder) is a common chronic neurological disorder that is characterized by recurrent unprovoked epileptic seizures. These seizures are transient signs and/or symtoms due to abnormal, excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. About 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy at any one time. Epilepsy is usually controlled, but not cured with medication, although sugery may be considered in difficult cases. Not all epilepsy syndromes are lifelong-some forms are confined to particular stages of childhood. Epilepsy should not be understood as a single disorder,but rather as a group of symptoms but all involving episodic abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
