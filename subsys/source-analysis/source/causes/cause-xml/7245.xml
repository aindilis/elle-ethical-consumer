  <description>come on guys and girls, please donate to us, so that we can actually start to live! Meaning we can buy food, put petrol in our cars, smoke, buy all the kids presents at christmas, go out once a month and holiday.
We are sick of surviving and not living! 
Have a heart give to the needy.
