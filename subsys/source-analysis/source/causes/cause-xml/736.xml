  <description>Thank you for visiting our cause - This is the official University of Michigan Facebook Cause page.

The best way to support U-M is via: www.giving.umich.edu - this will allow the highest percentage of your gift to make a difference at Michigan and will provide you more options for designating your gift.  

However, we do not want to prevent you from using the Facebook Cause page if you prefer to do so.  Therefore, you can count us as a Cause to highlight your love of U-M and even give to U-M through the page.

Please consider supporting the University of Michigan.  U-M is a global leader known for advancing all aspects of life: health, law and public policy, the arts and humanities, science and engineering. Students and faculty have the opportunity to achieve more at the University of Michigan than anywhere else. This is why our campaign is The Michigan Difference.

Your support of the University of Michigan can be the seed for change, discovery and education - all through one gift.

Thank you!


1. Support excellence, education and growth.</description>
