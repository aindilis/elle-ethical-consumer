  <description>impactRichmond is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization striving to be the hands of Christ in our community by preserving and revitalizing houses and communities, providing adequate shelter to homeowners via home remodeling, and providing hope by sharing our faith. Our program enriches the lives of the youth participants, adult counselors, and neighborhood residents it serves.


We believe there is one God, existing in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. In the Son, we are shown the greatest example of love. This love was demonstrated by Christ's actions in life, death, and resurrection. Because of this love and the power of the Holy Spirit, we serve others
