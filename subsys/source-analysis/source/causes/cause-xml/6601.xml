  <description>It is scandalous that in the richest most powerful country in the world more
than 46 million Americans are uninsured. Even for those lucky enough to have
insurance, rising costs and deteriorating coverage cause more than
one-in-four (28 percent) to go without needed care because they can't afford
it. Indeed, of the one million Americans bankrupted by medical bills
annually, more than three-quarters had insurance when they got sick.

Single-payer national health insurance would save enough on administrative
paperwork - more than $300 billion per year - to provide comprehensive
coverage to all Americans. It would provide full choice of doctor and
hospital for patients, and unleash physicians from arbitrary corporate
dictates over patient care. It would control the health expenses currently
crippling our economy and provide for a wholesome revitalization of our
democratic values.
