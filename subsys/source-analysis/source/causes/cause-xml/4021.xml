  <description>Through travel and cultural immersion, Up with People has provided students with a renowned international education and an unmatched passageway to see the world. And we've been doing it for four decades.

As the world has changed, so too has the Up with People program. Once primarily impacting communities through its musical productions, the current Up with People program addresses the very real need for young adults and leaders who have global perspectives, intercultural understanding, knowledge of worldwide social issues, leadership skills and a dedication to community service. Today, through its distinct 22-week program, Up with People students experience personal growth, leadership training, service learning and performing arts as they travel through three continents. For many students, it's a global education that lasts a lifetime; for others, it's a life-transforming experience.
