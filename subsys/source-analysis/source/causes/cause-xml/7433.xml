  <description>I started a profile on myspace.com to bring attention to the suffering and the misunderstanding that PITBULLS are going through.
We, as a society, must take a stand agaist BSL (Breed Specific Legislation) and animal cruelty (pitbull fighting, abuse, and neglect) immediately!!!

Now starting a cause on FACEBOOK is only the next step as we build up more and more people to join the fight and end this tragic injustice that these animals are enduring everyday.

1. To end BSL (Breed Specific Legislation)

2.  To end pitbull fighting, abuse, and neglect

3. To provide rescued PITBULLS with loving homes

4. To support PITBULL rescue shelters with support and financial aid</description>
