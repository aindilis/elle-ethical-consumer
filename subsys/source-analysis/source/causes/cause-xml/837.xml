  <description>The American Cancer Society is a Nationwide community-based voluntary health organization.

Relay for Life is the American Cancer Society&#8217;s signature fundraising event.

Currently over one million people get cancer each year. Nearly half of all men and a little over one third of all women in the United States will develop cancer during their lifetimes. 

Working with ACS is one of the most powerful ways you can help to fight this devastating disease.
