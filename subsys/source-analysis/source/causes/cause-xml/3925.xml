  <description>Being in the local music scene is a bitter-sweet experience. This is a place where musicians can come to ask for/give advice for things like: getting gigs, tips for recording, sharing inspiration, etc... Anyone is welcome to post their band website, myspace, pure volume, or whatever you can use to broadcast your music to the masses on this page.
