  <description>Eating more meals at home will have many benefits. You will more likely eat smaller portion sizes, healthier food choices and know more about what you are eating not to mention the money you will save!

With all that money you will be saving why not support a good cause? Not just any cause but this one, one that gives Ethiopian Jews a better chance at healthy and full lives.  This organization deals exclusively w Ethiopian Jews and helps provide food, education and jobs for Ethiopian Jews remaining in Ethiopia or moving into Israel.

Not only will supporting this cause encourage you to eat at home more often, but it will also remind you how fortunate you are to be living in North America.

1. We need to have more respect for food.

2. We need to educate ourselves and our children on how what and when we eat affects us.

3. We need to be more proactive in supporting what we care about.
