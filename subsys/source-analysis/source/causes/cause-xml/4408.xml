  <description>An independent Kurdistan is not only a vision that over 30 million Kurds have desired for centuries, but it is a future that if granted, has the potential to empower a people that look up to the United States and desire a peaceful nation.  The Kurds have already begun to establish a semi-autonomus state in Northern Iraq, but it only emcompasses 6 million of the total population.  The rest are located in Turkey, Iran, Syria, and around the entire world.  It is time that the Kurds have an independent state in their homeland.  Take a look at the progress that has been made in Northern Iraq via the Kurdistan Development Corporation and judge for yourselves.

1. The Kurdish people have the right to self-determination.

2. The Kurds are pro-west and pro-democracy and should be embraced.

3. Kurdistan will be a force for good in a region that has turned to chaos. </description>
