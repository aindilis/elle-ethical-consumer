  <description>Project Active is a global initiative with a commitment to diffusing world tension and lifting individuals from the negativity spawned from violence and civil strife. 

With donations of athletic equipment, children in impoverished countries will have the opportunity to abandon violence and compete as athletes in friendly athletics; showcasing the true potential of the human spirit.

By creating basketball courts and soccer fields in areas of social  unrest, Project Active gives an alternative to conflict; with every sports team founded in the Middle-East and every marathon organized in Africa, there is a bringing together of like-minded individuals after a common goal: to be the best that they can be.

Project Active is a non-profit initiative of the La Jolla Foundation, dedicated to making the world aware of the peace-inspiring potential of sport and friendly competition. Visit Project Active's website at: http://www.projectactive.org
