  <description>Too many turtles are dying because of careless drivers. Please do not risk your own life to save the life of a turtle, but do not hit them on the road either. Turtles are simply trying to get from one side to the other. It is not their fault that they are slow/small/fat/etc. Help raise awareness of the poor turtles' plight by joining our cause.

1. Turtles are innocent.

2. Turtles aren't that big, you can miss them.

3. Drivers wouldn't hit a dog on purpose - turtles are pets too.</description>
