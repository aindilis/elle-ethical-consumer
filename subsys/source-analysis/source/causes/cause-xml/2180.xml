We don't realize how much plastic is wrecking our land and now there is a load of plastic junk in the Pacific Ocean that is twice the size of Texas. This is not only affecting the marine animal's health, but our own health as well. There is no avoiding it, just from walking outside it can seep into our bodies through our skin.

2. save the marine animals

3. save ourselves</description>
