  <description>If you are out here on the net trying to make a living for you and your family; If you are looking for an honest enterprise that will help you fulfill your "call" to help others thru entreperneurial pursuits, Empowering Ourselves is the vehicle for you.

If your business provides a service,products, or other niche items, you are cordially invited to come and put your hat on the rack.

Only ethical, hands-on products, or services that meet a need or requested to join. And for those of you who are prudish and don't think that Sex is one of the enterprises that should be allowed, since God made Sex an intregal part of the human makeup, and since it is the glue that helps to keep a "right" relationship together, thus ensuring that our Society does not fall apart, and since there are some ethical and well intended people pursuing the goal of improving the sex lives of others, they too are invited to come and join the ship. If you have a problem with that, I can understand, but I would hope that we "could all get along". 

So...Come on over! Join in the pursuit of Empowering Ourselves!
