  <description>CFL bulbs help to lower CO2 emmisions, and lower our electricity bills. Buying and switching your lightbulbs is an easy thing to do, and the world would be such a better place! Switch the bulbs in your apartment, at your dorm, in your house, and let your friends and family know about CFL bulbs, they're going to want to save money too. CFL bulbs are especially nice if you are paying the electricity bill. 

Example: By switching 4 bulbs to CFL bulbs, it reduces CO2 emissions by 1312 kg. (thats a whole lot of crap in the atmosphere), and would save you $ 384 Euros a year....which translates to (rounding the exchange rate to 1.36 USD per Euro) $522. 24.
