  <description>Global warming does not exist! 
There is evidence all around us that can and will disprove the theories of global warming.
The summers get warmer....so what? It can be attributed to many things but the scientists choose to create some bogus theory that will scare the crap out of people.
Yes we need to be more fuel efficient, but that does not mean "greenhouse gasses" are going to destroy the planet by melting the polar ice caps.
Debates are welcomed, proof required for said debates.

1. Global Warming does not exist

2. The media is out to scare the nation by using the myth of Global Warming</description>
