  <description>Members of Team Diabetes personally raise funds on behalf of the Canadian Diabetes Association, while training for marathons worldwide.  
I have previously run 12 events with Team Diabetes including Iceland, Rome, Kelowna, Toronto, Ottawa,Bluenose, New York marathons and the Disney Goofy Challenge raising over $34,000. Upcoming races.. Rio De Janeiro 2012.
My family is affected by diabetes as my daughter was diagnosed with type 1 at age 2.  Her pancreas no longer produces insulin, the hormone responsible for regulating blood glucose levels.  Meal-to-meal she must balance carbohydrate intake, exercise and insulin injections to obtain target blood sugars. 
More than 2 million Canadians live with some form of diabetes.  If you would like to support me in my cause for the Canadian Diabetes Association you can pledge me online at the following link:

Charitable tax receipts are given for donations of $15 or more. Thank you.
