One of the most important things we can give our Pets is "Time". The time to love them, care for them, and train them. Animal Rescues and Humane Societies across the country are filled with Pets whose families didn't have "Time". Every year, the "Time is up" for 12 million companion Pets. 

Do you have the "Time" to make a difference?
