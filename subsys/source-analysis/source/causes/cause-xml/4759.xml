  <description>My father was recently diagnose with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The primary cause of COPD is cigarette smoking and exposure to excessive amounts of second hand smoke. COPD is a combination of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. This disease is only partially reversal and if not treated as soon as possible, death my result. By joining smoking cessation programs, increasing quality of life by exercising and monthly visits to your family physician, this disease may hopefully decline amongst individuals. Here are some alarming statistics:
-"COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the US &amp; is projected to be the third leading cause of death for both males and females by the year 2020" (COPD-International.com, 2004). 
-"According to the 2000/01 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), 4.3% of the adult population 35 years of age and over stated they had COPD (emphysema/COPD or chronic bronchitis) that had been diagnosed by a physician" (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2003). 
-"Official statistics show that more than 714,000 Canadians have been diagnosed with COPD; this is 2.3 % of the Canadian population" (Canadian Lung Association, 2007).
I want to increase awareness about this disease and hopefully aid in prevention of this disease. So please help me stop COPD. Big dreams can come true. :)
