  <description>John Wolfston, Evan Perry, and Spencer Mack are going to build a railway cart (the teeter-totter things that go on railroads) and are ideally going to make it all the way to Chicago, while raising money for Darfur along the way. It is going to be way kick ass. Dope shit.

1. Railway carts are super sweet.

2. Boys will be boys. Boys II Men. Real boys don't like men. Men touch Boys. Boys touch boys. Boys have fun. 

3. Oh yeah, bad stuff in Darfur is really lame.</description>
