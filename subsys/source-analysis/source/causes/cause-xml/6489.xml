  <description>I am hoping to help others understand that people with down syndrome and other rare disabilities are people too....in my family I have a brother with down syndrome, autism and alopecia aswell as another with a rare disability called opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome...I have gone through life, aswell as many other families most likely have, watching others judge them because of the problems they have. This shouldn't be happening. they are just like us just have to live life possibly a little differently. Help me raise the awareness that everyone is the same but just has to deal with somethings a little differently

1. People should not just a book by its cover

2. People with disablilties are some of the greatest people you could ever meet

3. To help people realize that they may find it funny to stare or make fun but it hurts others</description>
