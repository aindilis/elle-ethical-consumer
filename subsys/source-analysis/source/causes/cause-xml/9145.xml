  <description>As part of a kickstart to Global Awareness 07-08 we are asking you please to save your change. Whatever change you get please keep it in either a bag or something resourceful and sometime during thanksgiving actually the day before we get out for thanksgiving we will ask you to empty your change in the BIG CONTAINER (earth friendly of course) in Heck's class and then we will take it a local coinstar and get it transferred into cash value which will help sponsor a child living in poverty/hunger/or genocide. 

So again please remeber to save your change. 

Every year Americans throw about close to a 30 million dollars worth of change away think about how much we can do with all that money/ I urge to get everyone invovled and if u have any questions please contact either Mr. Heck, Mark Pieterson, Caroline Fryar, Cassandra Hlong, TylerGibson, Brad Lake, or anyone in global awareness club (please also join the club if u haven't already its great!)

Again let everyone you know from your great great grandmother to that guy u know from way back when know about it we could really do something big.
