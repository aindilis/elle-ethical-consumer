  <description>Africa is notoriously known for having problems, not only in poverty, war, and genocides such as the one going on in Sudan right now, but in child slavery. Every day children as young as 3-4 years old are being sold by their parents to get extra money. More often than not, these chlidren are sent on boats all across Africa to fish and do intense manual labour. Some of these chlidren at the ages of 5 have such muscular physique their bodies are maturing too quickly. They are hardly fed, and if they are it only consists of one meal a day, often just a bowl of rice. Doesn't that seem wrong to you?

1. Raise awareness.

2. Let the African Government know that their chlidren have rights too.

3. Help end it.</description>
