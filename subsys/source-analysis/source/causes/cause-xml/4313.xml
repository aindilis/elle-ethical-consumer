  <description>There are at least 1 Million children exploited by the global sex trade every year.  Each child is a part of the $32 billion dollar human trafficking industry.  This industry is the third largest industry in the world right now, third to only illegal arms trade, and drug trafficking.  Child trafficking is also expected to overtake the other two by the end of the year.  This is a very serious problem ion this present age.  It is our desire to be able to reach out to past victims of this "industry", to eventually provide safe houses where victims will be able to live and be able to transition back into their lives and be able to deal with all the depression and pain that goes along with being trafficked.  

1. Share the reality of child sex trafficking in the U.S. and worldwide.

2. To reach out to children who have been victims of sex trafficking.

3. To stop the increase of sex trafficking around the world.</description>
