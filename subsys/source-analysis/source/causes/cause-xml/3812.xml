  <description>Camp Heartland is a national 501 (c) 3 that makes a profound and positive impact on the lives of children who experience HIV/AIDS, poverty, foster care, grief and other life challenges.

1. All people deserve to live with dignity and respect no matter their HIV status, economic status or background.

2. Until there is a real one, compassion is our only cure for HIV.

3. HIV is preventable but is spreading in young people aged 15-24 at alarming rates.  Young people must educate each other to stay HIV negative!</description>
