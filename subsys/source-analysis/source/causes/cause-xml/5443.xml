  <description>Discrimination of different denominations has hindered if not crippled ourselves as a whole Christian Society. Jesus did not want us to separate into hundreds of denominations. Prejudices and feuds between denominations have started wars, suffering, and ungodly acts. We should accepted differences and remember that we all believe in the one true God, and that our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ died for our sins, and the Holy Spirit runs through us ALL.


1. Discrimination between churches must end.

2. Denominations should unite to do Gods will.

3. The spread of Christianity through Christ's Word of Forgiveness, Acceptance, and Love for All.</description>
