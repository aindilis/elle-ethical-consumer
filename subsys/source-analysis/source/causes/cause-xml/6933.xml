The enviormental condition of Earth is deteriorating as you read this. Unless significant measures are taken on a world-wide basis to preserve forests, by 2030 there will only be ten percent remaining with another ten percent in a degraded condition. 80 percent will have been lost and with them the irreversible loss of hundreds of thousands of species.
   Man has advanced through the ages and today we face a challenge. Since we represent a great chapter in history, we will overcome this feat, but only with great men and women of courage can this feat be accomplished. 
   If we do not take action, the generations following us will remark on our negligence.
   Fellow human beings, let us save this planet and make it a planet we live in, with pride.

Live Free.

1. Protect all plants and animals from unjust destruction.
