  <description>Joubert syndrome is a rare (affecting 1 in 268,000 people), genetic disorder that affects the area of the brain that controls balance and coordination. The disorder is characterized by agenesis (absence) or hypoplasia (underdeveloped) part of the brain called the cerebellar vermis and a malformed brain stem. The most common features include ataxia (lack of muscle control), an abnormal breathing pattern called hypernea, sleep apnea, abnormal eye and tongue movements, and hypotonia. Other malformations such as extra fingers and toes, cleft lip or palate, tongue abnormalities, and seizures may also occur.
