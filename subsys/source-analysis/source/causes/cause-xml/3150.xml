  <description>The Souper Bowl of Caring began with a group of high school students in Columbia, SC and has grown to a national initiative to engage young people in the issues of hunger and poverty.  This Super Bowl weekend event is a simple and fun service activity where 100% of all collections are donated directly to the charity selected by each participating group. 

1. Young people can make a difference.
