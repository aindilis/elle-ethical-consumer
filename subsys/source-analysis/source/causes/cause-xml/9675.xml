  <description>The Pies Descalzos Foundation is a not-for-profit, non-governmental organization founded in 1995 by recording artist Shakira, aimed at helping Colombian children who are victims of violence.

Its main goal is to provide education, nutrition, health coverage and emotional and psychological support to children who have been displaced by violence and those living in poverty.

The Foundation&#8217;s programs and projects are financed with contributions by national and international corporations, through alliances with government entities, with donations by regular people and with the support of Shakira, who urges, inspires and generates the creation, progress and development of means to raise funds for the children in need.    

We invite you to discover our history, learn about our programs, understand our values, and most importantly, help us help.
