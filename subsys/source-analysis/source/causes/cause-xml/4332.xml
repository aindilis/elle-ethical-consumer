  <description>This cause is as is depicted by Detective Slocks in his most revered exercise in free-verse entitled, "the Cause of Gauze." Please join and support this meaninful cause.


"Slocks's famous work on the Cause of Gauze serves us not as a mere description or aesthetic, but as a profound escort into a new, grander way of living for humanity.  It is a compelling thought that such a magnificent concept as the Cause of Gauze came forth to the world from the confines of a jail cell.  These modest and controversial beginnings serve only to reinforce the beauty of the conceptual framework of the cause and the forthrighteousness of it's author."

--Jacques Derrida
