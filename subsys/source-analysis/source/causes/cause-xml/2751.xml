  <description>Bad breath, 
Face filled with hatred, 
Children, we are titled as marginalized, 
And we remain in spite of us, scorned. 

Street, diseases 
Street, violences 
Street, miseries 
Street, nightmares 
Street, desolations 
What do you say about our childhood, 
What do you want for our adolescence, 
What do you make out of our taken  joy? 

Rains and dew, 
Sun and cold, 
Thirst and hunger, 
Despair and sorrow, 
We knew you. 

Pavements did we know, 
Macadams did we recognize, 
Beaches did we furrow, 
Dumps did we foraged,
For the least daily bread. 
Begging's prisoners, 
We seek profits of cause.
By avoiding with accuracy Psychosis, 
to drive back cowardice. 

Street, bullying 
Street, myseries 
Street, embraces 
Of the pure sufferings . 
There are too many melancholies 
For a so short life. 
So then, which life 
If not ours, of happiness the desire.

1. Children are the mind of a great tomorrow !

2. Will Streets become school and teachers for our own children ?

3. They do not know how to laugh any more !</description>
