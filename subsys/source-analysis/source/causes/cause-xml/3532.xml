  <description>I wrote a few letters to music producers in Los Angeles and New York while i was in Europe and have given them an idea.. a project...

write a strong motivated song that will heal souls with music to those that are infected with aids, diagnosed with cancer,  and kids that have other illnesses, or are starving, etc.
 and so some celebrity singers get together.. sing a song together to encourage hope and strength to those kids.. at the same time, it raises money that can be used to help them pay for some treatment and medicine. 

You can support that idea, or not. The more people will join, the more hope there is that producers will consider spending time with this and make it real. 



1. Kids with serious diseases need motivation and strength to keep hope of living

2. raised funds will hopefully pay for treatment to heal their sickness
