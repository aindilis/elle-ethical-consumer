  <description>When we humans fight together, we simply get better results.  That is the whole ethos of charity, but your &#163;1 a month can only go so far.....

By improving education in Africa, millions will benefit not only in the short term but for years to come. Education is the key to progress, and millions of children in affected countries are not only victims of disease, famine, and war, but the victims of poor distribution and administration of charity donations from the selfless donations of the few in the Western World.

This cause has been volountarily set up, with very little knowledge on the matter, but with great enthusiam to generate awareness. By raising awareness and social pressure on the powers that be, we CAN generate progress.

Collaboartion with any parties with expertise in the area are very welcome.
