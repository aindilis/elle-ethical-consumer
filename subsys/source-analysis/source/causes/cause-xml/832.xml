  <description>Sometimes in life it seems as if we only have one chance at success. With high hurdles and low pitfalls, life seems especially challenging for our city's at-risk youth...those who are faced with having to deal with seemingly hopeless realities day in, and day out. In the minds of these young people, there is no second chance. 

Foundation for Second Chances, Inc is a community based organization which utilizes mentoring, hands-on education and community service to maximize the potential of youth. 

1. The school system fails at risk youth and something must be done to change it.

2. Through giving kids opportunity they can succeed.</description>
