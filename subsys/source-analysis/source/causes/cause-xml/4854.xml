  <description>The "Stop Littering!" cause is for all the people out there that got pissed off when they saw that fat bitch sitting in her car, just finishing off the big mac and supersize fries and throwing the cartons out the window. People need to start putting their garbage in the garbage can or bag. It makes our parks, and walkways more enjoyable. I come from a neighborhood with douchbags that drive ricerockets that throw all of there shit out of their cars onto the street. Some of this garbage includes wrappers, slurpie cups, and even used condoms. Do you really want your kids growing up thinking that is okay to throw garbage where ever they want. Do you really want them to be playing in an area that is poluted with trash that could be harmful to them. Do you want your dog to pick up or eat somthing that could be deadly to them? I think not. Start putting your garbage in your pockets untill you pass a garbage can and lets teach this to our future generations.  

1. Littering is dirty 

2. It makes our city's look gross

3. It is harmful to our environment; Garbage is better off in a landfill.</description>
