  <description>There has been much debate about how to deal with the more than 12million illegal immigrants now living in America and the hundreds of thousands more than attempt to come in illegally every year. Senator Inhofe has started an online petition to current Senators and Congressmen it says.

 "I am one of the millions of Americans who believes our first priority as a nation should be to secure our borders by enforcing existing laws. Amnesty is not the solution.

I urge you to vote against the immigration reform bill currently being considered in the Senate and to oppose any future effort that undermines our national security or grants amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants"

If you agree with the aforementioned statement, go to WWW.SECUREBORDERSNOW.COM to sign the petition and tell your national representatives that amnesty for illegal immigrants isnt the will of the people. 

1. Fair treatment for all those who have and want to come into America

2. Enforcement of current border, immigration, and naturalization laws

3. Senators and Congressmen should act as representatives that listen to their constituencies</description>
  <mission>Push Congressmen to listen to their constituents and enforce current border laws and not give lenient amnesty to illegal immigrants and reward breaking the law.</mission>
