  <description>The Ronald McDonald House&#174; of Cleveland is a home-away-from-home for families whose children are receiving medical care at Cleveland-area hospitals.  Most of these children have serious illnesses, such as cancer, leukemia, cystic fibrosis or heart defects. Their families may have traveled a great distance to seek treatment in Cleveland or live nearby, and they need to stay close to a critically ill child. 

The Ronald McDonald House provides the comforts of home &#8212; and much more. In addition to 37 guest rooms, the House offers comfortable living and play areas, a fully equipped kitchen, library, family resource center, children's playroom and laundry room. Surrounding the House are beautiful gardens, flowers, herbs, a children's garden with a waterfall, winding walkways and benches. This serene oasis was designated as a Backyard Wildlife Habitat by the National Wildlife Federation. 

This year alone, the Ronald McDonald House of Cleveland will serve more than 1,200 families. It stands as a symbol of comfort and support in our community, with open arms to welcome any family who might need shelter within its walls. It&#8217;s easy to see why our House is called "The House That Love Built."
