  <description>With Andy's blessing I am putting One Hour No Power onto facebook as a cause
This is cut straight from his website

http://www.onehournopower.com/

At midday on Sunday July 1st 2007 we are asking everyone concerned about the effects of climate change to simply turn everything (non-vital) off for an hour. That&#8217;s one hour with no cars, computers, TVs, etc. Through your support and lobbying we would also like as many businesses as possible to join in and publicly show their commitment to tackling climate change.

One Hour No Power aims to raise awareness of our collective ability to tackle climate change through our everyday lives.

This is a people powered event for everyone to help shape. Share your ideas for One Hour No Power by adding your comments to the event blog and find help with promoting the event locally on our &#8216;Join In&#8217; page.

It&#8217;s up to you how you spend the hour. You could hold a sponsored event for your favourite environmental group, take to the roads on your bike, write your personal green action plan for the coming year or simply spend time with family and friends.

Please join in and switch off between 12-1 pm on Sunday 1st July (in your local time zone).
