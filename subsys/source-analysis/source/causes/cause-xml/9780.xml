  <description>We believe that the United States would greatly benefit from a population that is proficient in more than one language.  Foreign language study is central to education in the majority of the other countries of the world.  Only the United States lags behind the other world powers in teaching its citizens to speak languages other than their native language, effectively isolating its citizens wherever they go.  In addition to increasing opportunities for international communication, the benefits of foreign language study throughout the schooling years include increased academic and cognitive abilities and greater cultural understanding and enrichment.  Therefore, we advocate the establishment of K-12 foreign language education as a core subject in the schools of the United States.

1. Early foreign language study results in improved cognitive skills and academic performance.

2. Foreign language study is best undertaken before the age of 10 years and continued through graduation in order to achieve the best and most lasting results.

3. Study of foreign languages results in broadening of cultural understanding and increased intercultural communication.</description>
