  <description>There are only five species of rhinoceros left today.  The Rhino species is over 50 millions years old.  Rhinos used to be diverse and populous.  There was even a rhino species native to North America.  However, Rhinos are now close to extinction.  

Rhino Population Estimates:
White rhino: 17,480
Black rhino: 4,280
Greater One-horned rhino: 2,700-2,850
Sumatran Rhino: 200
Javan Rhino: 35-55 

The more people know about Rhinos and their possible extinction, the more that can be done to increase rhino populations and save this species from extinction!  So tell you friends!
