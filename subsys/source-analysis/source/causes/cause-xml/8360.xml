  <description>Feed My Starving Children (FMSC) is a non-profit Christian organization committed to feeding God&#8217;s starving children hungry in body and spirit. The approach is simple: children and adults hand-pack meals designed specially for starving children, and FMSC ships the meals to nearly 70 countries around the world. See www.fmsc.org to learn more about FMSC and how you can become involved. 

1. 24 cents pays for one meal

2. 93% of total donations goes to the feeding program

3. A donation to FMSC always feeds two &#8211; the volunteer who packs the meal and the starving child who eats the meal.</description>
