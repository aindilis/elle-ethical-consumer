  <description>By donating $10 you can make a huge difference in the life of an African child who faces the daily threat of malaria. For Africans malaria can be like the flu to Americans it occurs so commonly, but without money for medication it becomes life-threatening. Around 1 million children die each year from the illness that is easily preventable with bed nets. This is a simple, one-time donation of $10 to save a life!
