  <description>The name is should be self-explanatory. We support the use of clean and renewable sources of energy, such as wind, solar, geothermal and tidal power. Clearly there is a problem with global warming. This doesn't only affect us, but everyone around us and all the future generations to come. Now is the time to act. Petition congressmen, contact your local representative, join organizations, get your friends involved; all these are ways to raise awareness. We can all help raise awareness of the benefits and the possibilities of clean energy if only we put some effort into it, so let's go out there and do it.

1. Promote the use of clean and renewable energy.

2. Raise awareness amongst the populace as to the viability of clean energy and conversely the dangers of global warming.

3. Promote healthy habits (you know, as in walking, biking, all that good shit).</description>
