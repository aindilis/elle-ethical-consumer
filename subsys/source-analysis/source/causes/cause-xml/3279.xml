  <description>There is a 49,000+ signature petition on the government's website opposing the construction of the 'mega-mosque' at Abbey Mills, London. The petition falsely claims that the mosque is being financed by the government and that its construction will lead to "terrible violence and suffering". Despite criticism from the IHRC and others over the petition's false and Islamophobic content, the government has refused to remove it from their website (report below).

However, a petition has been set up in support of the mega-mosque by Joseph Ashworth. Please show your support by adding your name and forwarding it on. Text of petition:

"We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to Go forward with plans to build a &#163;100 Million mega Mosque. I think that it would show how tolerant we are of other religions to build a large Mosque for people to worship at. Those who say that it would incite violence give not only Christians, but a large part of England, a bad name. So I urge you to sign this petition, whatever your religion, as long as you believe in tolerance." Help spread the word.
