  <description>A three day walk in Philadelphia in October for the fight against breast cancer.  We will be walking 20 miles each day for a total of 60 miles to raise money for breast cancer.  Each participant must raise $2,200.  Donate to breast cancer and my walk at http://www.the3day.org/philadelphia07/devyne.  Thanks!
