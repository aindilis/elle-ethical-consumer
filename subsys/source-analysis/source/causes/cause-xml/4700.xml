  <description>The Kasey Kahne Foundation was started by NASCAR driver Kasey Kahne in 2005. In 2006 the KKF raised and donated funds to the following deserving organizations. 

Ronald McDonald House
Make A Wish
Cornerstone Schools in Detroit Michigan
Victory Junction
The Red Cross
Kevin Gobrecht Memorial Fund
Lilly School
The Charlotte Bobcats Foundation

Funds raised come from several sources including event income, fan donations, corporate donations and online auctions (www.ebay.com/kaseykahnefoundation). 

In 2007 the KKF hopes to raise and donate more funds to deserving children&#8217;s organizations. We cannot do it without your help. 

Please get involved.
