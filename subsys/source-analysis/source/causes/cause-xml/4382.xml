  <description>It is a little-known fact that haggis are gentle creatures that have been hunted to near-extinction. By joining together, we can create an international ban on haggis-hunting, a practice that threatens the haggis population and is inhumane in its practices.

1. We oppose haggis hunting practices of any sort.

2. We support non-invasive study to increase the haggis population.</description>
