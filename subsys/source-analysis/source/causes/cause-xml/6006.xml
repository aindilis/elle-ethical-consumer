  <description>Through riding a horse student(s) benefit too much for words. Some may call what happens here a miracle. Each student participates in class where, depending on the individual child, their disabilities are temporarily forgotten they are normal children learning and having a great time, safely. Depending on their disability students are stimulated in different ways; whether it's a student with a physical disability who rides to stretch and as a byproduct learns to walk or a mentally disabled student who learn his letters, colors and to talk everyone benefits. Every class is designed for the student's safety in mind. Trained therapists, volunteers,  and employees all work together to make the experience as constructive and enjoyable as possible.
