  <description>The Daniel Is Poor Foundation was founded in 2002 in order to provide Daniel Hernandez with money so he may purchase "phat lewt," which will bring him temporary happiness.

1. Daniel is better than you at handling money so you should give it all to him.

2. Daniel deserves a wii, ipod, and ds lite.

3. Daniel being poor makes baby Jesus cry.</description>
