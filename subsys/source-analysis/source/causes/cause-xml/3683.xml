  <description>We provide a safety net for families most at risk; to help prevent infant mortality, child abuse and neglect through home based programs that provide education, healthcare and positive parenting skills.

Nurses for Newborns Foundation provides services to babies who are born with medical problems, born to teen moms or born to mothers with disabilities/mental health concerns, or who are born into families who do not have money for even basic necessities.

In addition to medical care, we assist families whenever possible with donated materials needed for safe care, such as diapers, formula, baby food, clothing, bedding, and cribs. We welcome hundreds of volunteers each year who help us manage the logistics of this work.

In addition to the medical component of our programs we assist families in getting connected with any additional medical, social or government services they may need.

Last year, we served over 3,000 infants and their families in Missouri and over 800 infants and families in Tennessee.
