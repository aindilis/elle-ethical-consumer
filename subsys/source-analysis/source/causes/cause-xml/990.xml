  <description>Certainly, there are some negative connotations that come with the term 'anarchy.' People seem to get their idea of what it actually is from right wing slanders of "that would lead to Anarchy" or the Sex Pistols' nihilistic joke about it.

I'm starting this cause to further people's understanding of what the political philosophy of Anarchism actually is.

All denominations (in this case, adjectives) are welcome. 


1. To bring the idea of Anarchism into the public's eye.

2. To abolish the state. (long term goal)

3. World Peace.</description>
