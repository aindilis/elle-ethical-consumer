  <description>Eyes to the Future is a group of individuals who have looked at the educational system in America and are tired of the one-sided, unchanging format of the post-NCLB education system.  Both vocational and traditional education are important in this world; it is unacceptable that all students, no matter level of desire, are forced into a liberal-arts education without any vocational or life-skills training.  

To quote Robert Heinlein, "Specialization is for insects".  Eyes to the Future desires to help establish programs of vocational and life-skills education alongside the standard secondary cirriculum.  As a student movement, Eyes hopes to bring talented individuals from all walks of life into the lives of secondary school students.  It is the opinion of Eyes to the Future that a human being who has only knowledge without a vehicle for its practical application is poorly readied for life in the modern world.

1. That all secondary school students should be given the right to learn both academic and vocational skills.

2. That, as the government and private organizations have no desire, that a group of college students and recent graduates can form to teach these skills to secondary school students. 

3. That an unbalanced life is one which leaves the mind, body, and spirit unsatisfied.</description>
