  <description>'Sir' Bono has been causing immeasurable damage to the global justice movement. For nearly two decades now, Sir Bono has been developing his image as a brand, where he has arrogated himself the role of the white man in the white-man&#8217;s-burden approach to philanthropy. His solution has no role for the African him/herself; his proposals do not include empowering the Africans and releasing them from the clutches of the multilateral financial institutions which have plundered their resource rich continent. But that, of course, would render superfluous the role of a phoney white liberal who could dispense deliverance and earn the coveted Nobel Peace Prize.

Queston: What is the difference between Bono and Jesus?
Answer: Jesus doesn&#8217;t think he&#8217;s Bono.

It is time he was handed the Nobel that he so desperately craves, and sent into retirement. If Kissinger, Shimon Peres or Teddy Roosevelt could win it, why can't he?
