  <description>The war in Iraq has flooded our newspapers, TVs, radios and internet for years now, yet little has been done to solve the issue. As men and women have argued over bipartisan politics, other men and women have lost their lives. It is time that the stubborn loyalties of political parties be dissolved and we unite to make a better situation in Iraq. This cause will be to inform our congress men and women that we need change now.

2. Dramatic changes must take place immediately

3. No life, whether a soldier or civilian, should be taken for granted</description>
