  <description>After watching the film RENT, seeing the broadway production, and doing hundreds of hours of research for a RENT school website... this group was created. This group is designed to spread the message and calling of the famous line from the musical RENT  and it's song "La Vie Boheme": ACTUAL REALITY, ACT UP, FIGHT AIDS! Even though Collins message didn't actually broadcast those words from MIT in the story, there's nothing in the world that says we can't get the message out to everyone that will listen.  

1. There is a cure for HIV/AIDS

2. There is a message and a calling  in ACTUAL REALITY, ACT UP, FIGHT AIDS!

3. There isn't one person on this planet who doesn't need to hear about, believe in, or join this cause.</description>
  <mission>Spread the message that we all need to face that this is ACTUAL REALITY we need to ACT UP and above all FIGHT AIDS!</mission>
