  <description>Right now the only type of education that is funded by the government is abstinence only until marriage. There is no evidence that this type of program works in preventing teenage pregnancies and the spread of HIV/AIDS and other STDS. In fact it actually aids in the spread of STDS and teen pregnancy because abstinence until-marriage programs do not teach about contraception methods. The government needs to accept the fact that teenagers are having sex and start funding sexual education programs that promote different methods of contraception.



What you can do to help:
     - Contact your local senator or congressman and  urge them to reject funding for abstinence education
     - Join Advocates For Youth and help the rest of the nation become more sexually aware (www.advocatesforyouth.org)

1. Other types of sexual education must be funded by the government.

2. There is NO evidence proving that abstinence until marriage education does work in preventing the spread of teen pregnancy and STDs</description>
