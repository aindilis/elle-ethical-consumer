  <description>The Habart Council on Moustache Governance was established in 2006, as an antidote to the antibartistic currents that undermine and contaminate our society. 

Our goal is to make people aware of how important it is that men have moustaches, that moustaches look good and that a human without a moustache is a woman or a sexless person. 

The moustache is the most powerful symbol of civilisation. It is impossible to get rid of a problem if the moustache is not applied to it. This is a scientific fact that has been known for thousands of years.

1. All men must grow a moustache, unless it is physically impossible for them.

2. Women must encourage men to grow and maintain moustaches. 

3. Having a moustache is an obligation and a privilege.</description>
