  <description>TBF's comprehensive network of members and supporters includes anglers, captains, mates, tournament directors, clubs and sportfishing businesses.  By coordinating efforts and speaking with one voice, we are able to work for solutions that are good for billfish and not punitive to recreational anglers.

Over 90% of marlin mortality is the result of bycatch in commercial fisheries outside the U.S.  Yet tremendous pressure continues to be placed on our oceans from fishing fleets trying to meet the demands of a hungry world.  TBF maintains it is time for a sea change.  We invite you to explore our website and learn more about our work, become a TBF member and do your part in ensuring billfish and billfishing for generations to come.
