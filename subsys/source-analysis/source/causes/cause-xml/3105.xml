  <description>Id Say that it is about time Grande Prairie Actually takes the TIME and effort to FINALLY fix the pot holes in this city the "RIGHT" way instead of all these temp Fixes!. 

 Considering how we all pay for the fixes anyways with tax dollars Not too mention then having to pay for fixing a Busted vehicle..

Well we are at it Perhaps a New mayor ?

1. it is our right to have maintained roads

2. We pay tax dollars to keep our city maintained</description>
