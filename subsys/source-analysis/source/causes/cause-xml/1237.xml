  <description>Epilogos is a relatively young organization that works directly with the citizens of San Jose Villanueva, El Salvador to improve their living conditions and opportunities as part of an overall initiative toward community development. Michael and Susan Jenkins, former Peace Corps volunteers from Concord, New Hampshire, currently live in El Salvador with the people of San Jose Villanueva and support many projects within and around this town as the true leaders of Epilogos. Projects are many and include working with the community to provide scholarships for children who can't afford to go to high school. As a result of the Jenkins' collaborative efforts, many children are now given the opportunity to continue their education.
