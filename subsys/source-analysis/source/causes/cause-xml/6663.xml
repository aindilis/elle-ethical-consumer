The 2007 Las Vegas Heart Walk will take place on October 13, 2007.  Over a 100 companies from Las Vegas will take part in making a difference in the fight against heart disease &amp; stroke.  The two diseases remain the No. 1 &amp; No. 3 killers in the United States. 

We will be walking to increase education and awareness of heart disease and stroke and celebrate the survivors who have fought these debilitating diseases.  This heart healthy, family friendly event is free of charge and open to the entire Clark County community.

1. For a healthy and happy heart!</description>
