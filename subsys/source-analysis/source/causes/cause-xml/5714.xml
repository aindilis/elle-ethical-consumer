  <description>The people in Darfur, Sudan are being brutally killed. The drought is bringing more instability and poverty to the region. American news are not informed and thus are not publishing new info. Sudan does not want to open its nation to other. We have to create awareness and make people know that a genocide is taking place and if we dont act know tomorrow may be too late. We have to prevent tragedies like the holocaust.  

1. International aid is neccesary. 

2. The killings must stop immediately.

3. Sudans government has to opens its doors to international help.</description>
