  <description>There is no reason for animal abuse. And I believe there is no reason why any cat should be "humanely euthinized" just because of shelter crowding, or mild disease. And there is absolutely NO reason for anyone to ever abuse a cat, or any animal, in any wayThere are other options for letting go of unwanted cats!  A sanctuary, like Tabby's Place, takes in cats from other shelters who are scheduled to be euthinized. However, Tabby's isn't a large facility. With support, we can help them grow and rescue more unwanted cats!

If anyone also works or volunteers at Tabby's, feel free to send suggestions on how to make this cause better!
