  <description>As time goes on, more and more rainforest's disappear. What are they putting in place of these rainforest's?  Golf courses and buildings. It's true. We are not only killing trees and hurting animals by taking away their homes and food supply a lot of out medicines come from the rain forest. Food to come from the rain forests(fruits and vegetables). We are losing all of this plus the over all beauty of nature. 

1. Trees are living things too and we are killing them.

2. Animals are having their homes and food taken away.

3. We are killing something beautiful.</description>
