  <description>enough is screwed up in this world. and yet we still have prejudice against some people's race, culture, habits, and personalities after hundreds of years of saying that it would go away eventually. i'm sick of it. me and the people i care about, our esteem is at stake. i'm part mohawk, italian, german, irish, british, and god knows what else and i'm tired of being discriminated against because of my backround and the things i wear or like. everyone is. so join my on my search to tone down the racism, deciet and utter discrimination in the world. because us teenagers...we are the future. and thats not only a cheesy line that adults use, but its true. we need to stop this madness before it goes too far.

1. Teens are the highest precentage of people discriminated against.

2. We must set aside our differences to save others.

3. Prejudice is still one of today's biggest problems.</description>
