  <description>Hey the more and more i think to myself that gays cant get married i realize how dumb it is... After all the people who have fought and died to help this and other equal rights causes. everyone is still not equal. Why is it sucha big deal to allow two males or two females to live there lives together. IT wont affect others it just makes it more official for the two lovers. Theres more than enough people to turn this world around so lets start but we gotta start now if tickle me elmo can go world wide rock this world wide. 

1. Gays should be allowed to get married

2. Eveyone deserves equal rights </description>
