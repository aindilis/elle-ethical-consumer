  <description>The Collectivist Gallery is a perpetual online art gallery with its feet firmly planted in the budding Micromentalist movement. Established and emerging artists share virtual gallery space side by side in a gallery of perpetual and fluid existence. Art will be priced according to the wealth of the buyer. The Collectivist Gallery allows artists to take control of pricing and distribution of the art they worked to conceptualize and create. Art can finally be made affordable to working men and women. 
 
WE are the Collectivist Gallery. 

1. We reject the idea that great art must be monumental in size.

2. We reject the idea that art should only exist in commercial galleries and museums

3. We reject the idea that only the wealthy should be able to afford great art</description>
