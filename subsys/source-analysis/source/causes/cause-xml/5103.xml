  <description>In Uganda there has been a terrible civil war going on for many years. Rebels against the government. Both parties extremely corrupt. The rebels being ruthless and brutal, use children as soldiers. They are brain washed drugged and forced into a world of insanity, slaughter, and genocide. Children as young as 8 carry and use automatic rifles. Most of them end mutilated.
