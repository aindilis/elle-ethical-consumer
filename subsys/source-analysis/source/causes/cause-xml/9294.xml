  <description>More than ten years ago, the founders of Northtown Housing Development Corporation established a clear edict for the revitalization of Rancho Cucamonga's Northtown neighborhood. 

NHDC would embellish what is inherent in the Northtown community - affordable housing, social services, and cultural pride in a community whose residents celebrate their Latin roots. In 1993, the City entrusted NHDC as a nonprofit entity to implement development activities. 

Since then, we have created close to 200 new affordable rental units, built 44 new single-family houses, and renovated 15 existing houses. In the midst of all this affordable housing activity, we also constructed a new community center that draws residents together with an array of social services, programs, and cultural events. All our developments benefit low income residents.

We believe in the wealth of resources inherent in our community, drawing from the residents who live here and the richness of the culture we celebrate. We also trust in the strength of the partnerships - public, private, and nonprofit - that have made our projects and programs successful. And we are always guided by the history of activism that is the backbone of our work today.
