  <description>IWF is a non-partisan, non-profit policy group located in Washington, DC. We are dedicated to research and education on domestic and foreign policy issues and accomplish our mission through frequent media appearances and communication with the public. As advocates for personal responsibility and common sense policy, we serve as a counterpoint for the Left's monopoly on so-called "women's issues."
