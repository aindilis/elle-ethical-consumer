  <description>In 1918, armistance of the battle of Vittorio Veneto was signed on November 3. However, the Italians kept fighting until November 4, allowing them to take the Austrian troops defending hostage as well as occupy the mostly German speaking region of Tirol. Today, Sudtirol is still occupied by the Italians and is part of the Trentino-Alto Adige region. Many Austrian Tirol citizens share this belief. The picture shows Tirol as divided between Italy in the south and Austria to the north.

1. Tirol should be unified.

2. National boundries should not supercede cultural ones.</description>
