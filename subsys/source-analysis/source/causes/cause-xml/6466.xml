Rainbow helps prepare today's young women to be tomorrow's leaders. Rainbow is a non-profit character building, service oriented organization. The main goal is to help its members become more than they dreamed possible. Involvement in Rainbow teaches girls three basic virtues: to have faith in a Supreme Being, other people and themselves; to have hope in all that they do; and to be charitable, for to live a life of service is the most rewarding life of all.


1. To keep IORG alive and active in today's youth.

2. To make young ladies into beautiful and strong women in our society.

3. To promote effective community leadership skills and, most importantly, service to humanity.</description>
