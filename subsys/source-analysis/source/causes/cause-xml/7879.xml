  <description>Clemenza became a friend of Vito Corleone after immigrating from Sicily, when Corleone held a package of guns for him to prevent their discovery by the police. A friendly and jovial man, he was known as a storyteller among many of his acquaintances and family members - a trait that endeared him to Vito, who Puzo described as "a listener to storytellers." Clemenza got his start selling stolen goods such as dresses and guns with Vito and Tessio as far back as 1917, and became a key figure in the growing Corleone family. Vito kept him close through the years - even making him godfather to his oldest son Sonny - though this was all to control his brutal and more ambitious tendencies.
