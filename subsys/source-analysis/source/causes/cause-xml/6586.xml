  <description>In an ever growing world, it is as important as ever to have the ability to propery communicate with the other citizens of the world.  It has been proven that students that are bilingual achieve better grades, and that early elementary children are more prone to quickly catching on to the language.  It is the purpose of this group to promote bilingual education at the early elementary level. We are behind many other countries in bilingual statistics. English may be the "International Language," but it is still vitally important that we promote bilingual education.

Learning a language is more than just speaking the language, it's a window into the culture surrounding the language. If more Americans were bilingual, we as a country would be more culturally aware and perhaps less prone to judging those around us.

The United States is a country filled with cultures from all over the world, but that is often forgotten because we fail to appreciate the cultures unknown to ourselves. We can end this by encouraging bilingualism from a very early age.

1. Bilingualism among early elementary children must be strongly encouraged by the US government.

2. Children should have the opportunity from an early age to experiment with different languages, beyond learning to count to 10</description>
