  <description>Viva Network helps Christians caring for children to work together in networks in order to increase their impact. It is a global movement of Christians with 81 network initiatives in 48 countries, helping 1.2 million children.

Networking is widely recognised as essential in addressing the huge problems affecting children across the world. In relation to AIDS, for example, Children on the Brink, 2002 stated that, "No single group or individual has the capacity to make a critical difference through independent action" [USAID, UNICEF, UNAIDS, US Bureau of the Census]. Networking facilitates strategic joint planning and action. It prevents resource wastage and accelerates programme growth, increasing capacity so that more children receive better care.
