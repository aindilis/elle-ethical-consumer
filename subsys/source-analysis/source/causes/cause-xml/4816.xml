  <description>The best way to explain the situation is directly from the Kansas 4-H Foundation:
"Some have asked about Greensburg and the tornado in Kiowa County.  If you have read the reports or watched tv you know that the whole town of 1,600 is completely gone.  We have been at a loss since last weekend to know what to do but I talked to our state 4-H leader, extension director and board chair on Monday and we set up a 4-H Recovery Fund for the county.  They have moved their offices to an adjacent county and their fairgrounds' buildings are completely gone.  Right now they are focused on hauling all of the debris away and getting the sewer, an use as they see what needs to be done.  The task will be enormous and given the elderly population that has been displaced I'm sure the town will be much smaller and forever scarred.
What is missing so much from the national reports is how neat that community was one week ago.  It was a typical community of hardworking, God-fearing, community-minded people who depended on each other with a degree of pride that comes from a dependence on faith, family and friends.  It is really sad to say the least.
Hopefully things will dry out so we can clean up the flood water and roadways.
We appreciate your prayers and support.

~Gordon Hibbard, Director of the Kansas 4-H Foundation"
