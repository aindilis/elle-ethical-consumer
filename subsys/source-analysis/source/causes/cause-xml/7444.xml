  <description>No more than 1 in 10 women with breast cancer have a genetic history of the disease, and science increasingly links toxic chemicals in our everyday environment to the high rates of breast cancer. 

For this reason, the Breast Cancer Fund is the only national organization focused solely on preventing breast cancer by identifying the environmental causes of the disease. 

Through public education, policy initiatives, outdoor challenges and other innovative campaigns, the Breast Cancer Fund mobilizes the public to secure the changes needed to stop this devastating disease.
