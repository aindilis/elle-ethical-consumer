  <description>The Jewish Funds for Justice is helping to build a resurgent movement for justice with a significant Jewish presence at its center. Because of our innovative programming, more synagogues are building dynamic congregations, more working families own their own homes, more young Jews are becoming Jewish leaders, more volunteers are serving the common good, and more communities are organizing for social change.

1. Hope/ Tikvah &#8211; We create a better future because we believe that progress is always possible and within our capacity to realize.

2. Courage/ Ometz &#8211; We take the necessary risks in pursuit of our purpose because our cause is righteous and just.

3. Humility/ Anavah &#8211; We behave with integrity as a reliable partner, ally, colleague, and friend because we cannot achieve our vision by acting alone.

4. Dignity/ Tzelem Elohim &#8211; We protect the rights of individuals to live in freedom and have access to opportunity because every person is a unique and infinitely valuable being.

5. Abundance/ Shefa - We act as stewards of our resources because we are obligated by the knowledge that our prosperity is not by our hands alone.

6. Community/ Kehilah &#8211; We build relationships where people help each other because individuals have a profound responsibility for the wellbeing of the whole.</description>
