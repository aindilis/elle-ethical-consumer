  <description>Forget the rainforest. The rainforest only gives us two good things:
1. Monkeys
2. Air

So, if we can somehow combine stem cells, genetic research, and the plot of any three Crichton novels, we can produce air-keys (or, "air producing monkeys," for you long haired, jobless, free loading, hippy fucks). Then, we can burn all of the rainforests down, and put up malls.

1. Make air monkeys!

2. Burn forest!</description>
