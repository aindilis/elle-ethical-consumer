  <description>This organization was created by binh rybacki after she returned to the US from her trip back to her homeland of Viet Nam. There she found young children working as peddlers and prostitutes on the streets which inspired her to change the ways of this country.  Children of Peace International was created to help the lives of these children, creating school systems and orphanages for them.  Key Club is a major supporter of this cause and Silver Lake Regional High School hopes to raise at least $10,000 to build a school and help support these children medically to help them build healthy lifestyles. For every $10,000 raised, a school for 200 can be built to improve the young lives in Vietnam and to end the horrendous conditions these children have had to live through.

1. Children deserve the opportunity to receive proper schooling.

2. The peddling and prostitution these children are succumbed to must end.

3. Medical attention is also a right these children deserve to have.</description>
