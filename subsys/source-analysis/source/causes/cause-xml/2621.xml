  <description>Two years ago, world leaders were given a huge global mandate to make poverty history. Unprecedented public pressure led them to make some big promises - to increase aid, and cancel many poor countries' debts. But they haven't acted urgently enough on the action necessary to eradicate poverty.

So in 2007, we are telling the rich countries that The World Can't Wait. They must deliver on their promises and take decisive action against poverty and climate catastrophe. 

* This is a NON-PROFIT organisation.. so please do not be fooled by the facebook way of doing things as they insist on having people donate. On the other hand, if you wish to donate to GLOBAL JUSTICE, another worthy organisation, please do by pressing donate on this site, as that is where the money will go.

http://www.makepovertyhistory.org is the main site, so please visit.
