  <description>Three years ago Steve left the show to supposedly go to college. He was replaced by his "cosin" Joe. Ever since that day one of the once greatest shows on t.v. has gone downhill. I have started this cause to try to make things right, it's time for Steve to come back and take his place as the king of children's television. Steve is a brilliant actor and has so much more to share with the world. We miss you. 
You don't have to donate anything, simply help us by joining the fight!
