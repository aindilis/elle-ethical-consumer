  <description>Autism is a developmental disability, usually showing up in children before age 3. The definition of autism has been broadened and is now referred to as "autism spectrum," recognizing the fact that the disability appears in different ways and degrees. Autism in any of its manifestations may be the result of a disruption in the development of the brain before a baby is born. Autism appears to have a significant genetic component, but it also can appear in families with no history of autism. Families of children with autism, however, have a higher than average rate of developmental language problems and problems processing information. Autism affects early brain development, and its effects usually continue throughout a person's life.

Autism interferes with the way a child interacts with the world:

It affects the way a child communicates, in both verbal and nonverbal ways.

It affects social interaction, both physically and verbally.

It can cause a person to repeat behaviors or words.
