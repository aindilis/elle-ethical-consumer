  <description>Who wants teenage idiots, besides used car salesmen? NOBODY! Comrade, it's time we fight back, use your intellectual skills to outsmart them into oblivion, here's how your conversation should look like:

Teenage Idiot: Eeeh-hooo, deed yo now zat internet iz worldwaid?

You: No shit Captain Obvious! Good job working that out, Have a cookie. You should win a nobel prize for working so hard. I think you deserve to be put on a pedestal. Where? you ask. IN THE MUSEUM OF FUCKING IDIOTS!

That's enough for them to possibly slit their wrists-- err, I mean, learn stuff, enjoy a world where people do IQ tests for fun!

1. Purge all teenage idiots

2. Make idiots purge themselves

3. Read about the history of Stalin</description>

Convert to what? People who know stuff!</mission>
