  <description> Women and Youth Supporting Each Other, or WYSE, is a national mentoring organization and project of Community Partners. Since its inception, WYSE has been dedicated to strengthening the lives and communities of women and girls of color through a curriculum based, group and one-on-one mentorship program that strives to address all the issues that can contribute to their disempowerment.

Since 1992, WYSE has grown dramatically from one branch at one university to thirteen branches at 12 universities nationwide. In 1997, we developed a nonprofit resource office to provide our college based programs with guidance, training and support. Over the last decade, we have enabled over seven hundred college women to gain the insights and skills necessary to become life-changing mentors, and provided over 1000 girls with the resources and support necessary to make informed, healthy decisions and take leadership roles in creating community change.

1. Girls must be given responsible information.

2. Youth must be valued as contributing members of society.

3. Women must form communities and safe spaces with one another.</description>
