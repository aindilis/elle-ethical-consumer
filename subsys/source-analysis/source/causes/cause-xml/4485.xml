  <description>ActionAid work in over 47 countries throughout Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean providing access to basic human rights and needs, such as healthcare, food and clean water, education and security.  

I'm doing a skydive for actionaid at the end of the month, my mission is to raise &#163;300 ($600) in the next 10 days. 
please pass this on and if everyone donates 50p or $1 should hit the target. 

cheers
