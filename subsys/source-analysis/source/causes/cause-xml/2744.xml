  <description>Standing Together is a non-profit organization that started by sending pizzas to soldiers guarding the checkpoints. Seeing the smile on the soldier's faces helped the volunteers of Standing Together realize the importance of keeping our soldiers happy. Standing Together then began to cater to the different needs of soldiers, sending drinks, food, clothes, undergarments, and more to our soldiers in the field. Every Independence Day Standing Together arranges barbecues for over 1,500 soldiers who are on duty instead of celebrating with their families. The Friends of IDF in Israel ("FIDF") are the organizations cosponsors, helping Standing Together change the lives of some of our soldiers. This is only the beginning.
