  <description>The NRA foundation, Inc helps promote legislature that will help us law-abiding citizens keep our firearms.  They defend the Second Amendment's clear-cut message: American citizens have the right to bear arms.  They also have numerous firearm safety courses and programs, instructor certifications, self-defense courses, etc.

Support your constitutional right to own a gun.  Whether it be for sport or survival, refuse to be a victim by being inactive.

1. We have a constitutional right to bear arms that cannot be denied

2. Taking away guns from good citizens can easily make them victims</description>
