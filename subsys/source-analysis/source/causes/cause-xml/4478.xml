  <description>Our mission is to ban the canadian seal hunt. We don't believe in using barbaric ways towards any living being. The seal hunt has no reason to be, in Canada or in any other place! 
Help us form a strong group for a strong cause!
Together we can make things happen, anything is possible!

1. Canada's seal hunt must end immediately.

2. Living beings have to be respected therefore not tortured to death,

3. Banning the seal hunt in Canada will encourage the banning of seal hunting in many other countries in the world.</description>
