  <description>Music, Dance, Theater, Humanities, Visual Arts, Graphic Arts, Martial Arts, you name it.  The Arts are a fundamental part of society and we cannot just let the leaders of our schools throw it out just because it is a financially convenient option.

1. The Arts are among the most important things we learn about in school. They provide a well-rounded education not based on a test's requirements.

2. Maintaining a strong arts program will help not only the students to succeed, but it will strengthen the community in which they live.

3. Students and their parents should act against cutting the Arts from their schools' curricula.

4. The Arts prepare students for the real world by exposing them to culture, and teaching critical thinking skills that test-score classes don't teach.</description>
