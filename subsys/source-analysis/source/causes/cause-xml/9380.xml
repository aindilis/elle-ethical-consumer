  <description>His name is Eric Volz. He is a U.S. Citizen and has just been sentenced to 30 years in a Nicaraguan prison for crimes he did not commit. He was working as the publisher for El Puente Magazine in Nicaragua when he was accused, convicted, and sentenced for murder.

He is suffering a slow and debilitating existence under conditions beyond your comprehension. Fighting starvation and under the constant threat of violent attacks... his life is on the line everyday!
