  <description>Direct Relief is California's largest international nonprofit, founded in 1948. We're known for our emergency response, but we provide medical aid around the world every day. We're privately funded, so we rely on donations to do our work to help people live healthier lives. We turn $1 into $25 in medical aid. Learn more at www.DirectRelief.org

1. We provide medical aid so that people get the medicines and care they need but can't afford.

2. We support more than 1,000 clinics across the U.S.

3. Our partners work in more than 70 countries worldwide.</description>
