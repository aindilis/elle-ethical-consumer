  <description>wear a safety pin, save a life.  in the bible it says that God so loved the world he gave his only son, that whoever believes in him shall not parish and have eternal life.  now he died for us and if you read on more it talks about us believing in him... he have to do the same with others.  "wear a  safety pin, save a life."

1. dont get the colored ones, the silver ones are better.

2. wear it off so others can ask about it.</description>
