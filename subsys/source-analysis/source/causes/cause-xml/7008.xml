  <description>Fight for Da Beef to vanquish his arch-nemessis, the evil foe Samos!

We need to fight in the beaches, in the whiskey bars, in Anfield!

We cannot finish until Keith Da Beef is PM!

Some of you may die-it shall not be in vain
Some of you may be seduced by the dark Samos-you will always have a home here waiting for you
Some of you may drink wiskey and support Liverpool-you are dead to us.

KDB 4 PM!!

All donations go to Amnesty International, fighting against political prisoners held captive by the Samos and his Whiskey.

1. Keith Da Beef shuld be PM

2. Samos is evil

3. Whiskey is the liquor in eniquity

4. Nottingham Forest are truly the greatest of the under-rated goliaths of English football.</description>
