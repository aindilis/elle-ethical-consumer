  <description>Star Light trains women to be chaplains in strip clubs. These dedicated volunteers adopt a strip club, visit regularly with gifts for the dancers, and intentionally build relationships with the dancers. They are then able to provide spiritual, emotional, and physical resources to dancers who have those needs.

We help women who are exotic dancers build supportive communities and find resources for successful living.

1. Women who are exotic dancers are people of value and should not be excluded from society or church.

2. This is not who I am, this is just my job!

3. Every woman gets to define successful living for herself!</description>
  <mission>Star Light shares unconditional love and friendship with women who are exotic dancers so they will not forget they are also loved and valued by God. </mission>
