  <description>We the People...

Derserve the right to not have the idiots of the world interfere with our lives, home, family, and the nature of mutual co-existance.;

Uphold the principle of responsibility to not allow stupidity to overcome our moral, self-respect, and self-determination;

Create the acknowledgement that these people do, are, and will continue to erode our ability to live happy and normal live;

Will stand strong, united, and ever vigilant to defend our family, friends, and those we care about from becoming one of these abominations; and

We pledge to continue our perseverance and avoide the follies that can contribute to our own fall to the dark side.

Those obliged to answer the call deserve better and will continue to vocalize our thoughts and emotions to stop these people from destroying the world.
