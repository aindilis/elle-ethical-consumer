  <description>Most of you guys probably already know about the group on facebook, the Help Cassandra reach her dream! and this is pretty much the same thing &lt;3

Along with raising $7,OOO I am also collecting blankets, towels, dishes, ect. =)

Ergh, one thing tho is that we aren't donating it to the Humane Society of CANADA, it's of Calgary instead. I just couldn't find it on the list so pleasee don't donate to this place, go to my group instead, thanks!! &lt;3

1. Since they need money for vet bills, food, ect!

2. Cats sleeping and laying on newspaper and dogs with no blankets at all.

3. It feels SO good when you do something right to help out!</description>
