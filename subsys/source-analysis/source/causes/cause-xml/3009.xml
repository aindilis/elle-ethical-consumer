  <description>Join the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and stick it to the man. We need to be one step ahead.The Man is the establishment; the one with power; with money. The one with the ability to hold you back and keep you down. He is the police. The government. The schools. The job. The boss.

Enron's corporate scandalThe concept of The Man is no longer a black-white thing. We&#8217;re not talking about race. We aren&#8217;t talking about man vs. woman, either.

We are talking about anyone holding anyone else down. &#8220;You have the power and I don&#8217;t.&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;ve got the money, and you make sure I can&#8217;t get it.&#8221;

Everyone has a Man. By now, you&#8217;ve hopefully figured out that Bill Gates is The Man. But did you know that he also has a Man? Sure! We all do.

The Man is everywhere. He controls everything. The Man is the invisible hand that pulls your strings.
