  <description>The LAWS Project for Nuclear Awareness (PNA) meets an important need. Founded in March, 2006, as a sister organization to the Lawyers Alliance for World Security (LAWS) we educate the public about the dangers of nuclear weapons, and the need for nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. We are using the strength of growing public opinion against nuclear and mass destruction weapons to educate our Washington representatives as well. We accomplish our work through various media -- e.g., books, lectures, discussions, conferences, Web site interaction, pod-casting, letter-writing, a petition campaign, and finally visits to Capitol Hill or to district offices of our Senators and Representatives. Most recently we held a major National Press Club conference, only a year after coming into being as an alliance of citizens and expert groups.
