  <description>The United States of America was founded on the basis of freedom and liberty.  Millions of people in the U.S. have paid with their lives to uphold this common belief that "all men are created equal", and that the Bill of Rights that James Madison so faithfully introduced was not in error when it gave us freedom of religion in the First Ammendment.  

However, throughout American history, religious groups such as the Jews and Catholics have been at best tolerated, and at worst hunted.  Many a presidential hopeful has run on a platform that contains strong tone of anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish, etc. 

It isn't hard to understand why this happens - the U.S. is largely considered a Protestant nation, and was founded as such (not directly, but the strong Puritan influence among our Founding Fathers is not to be ignored).  

This cause is a commitment to stand up for the equal rights of Catholics worldwide, whether you yourself profess the Faith or not.

1. Catholic politicians, lawyers, and judges should be given equal respect

2. Catholic bashing and hating must stop.</description>
