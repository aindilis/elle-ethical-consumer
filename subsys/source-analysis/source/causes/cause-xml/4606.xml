  <description>In a world where 20% of the world's population (also the most wealthy) consume 85% of the world's resources, there are obvious gross inequalities in resource distribution. On top of this, in many cases it is the poor and disadvantaged that most acutely feel the impacts of poor environmental practices.  This must be addressed. 

Environmental justice strives to address inequitable distributions of environmental burdens (noise, air and water pollution, industrial facilities, etc) and access to environmental goods (nutritious food, clean air &amp; water, parks, recreation, health care, education, transportation, safe jobs, etc.)
