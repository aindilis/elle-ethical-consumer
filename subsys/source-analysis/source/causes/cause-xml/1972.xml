When Eastlake police arrived at a burglary scene on East 359th Street, they were stunned to find tortured, mutilated kittens inside the home. Police Lt. Bill Gutowski struggled to find words for the incident. "It's just sick," Gutowski said. "It's hard to describe, to believe someone would do that to little kittens."

Two kittens inside lay dead - one soaked with water and left in a freezer, another crushed and cut in two, its pieces found in separate rooms. Three others, who all survived, had been thrown against a wall. Charged with the deeds was William Whitlow, 22, of Concord Township.
