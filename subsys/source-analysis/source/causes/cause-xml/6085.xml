  <description>"Path to Freedom" is a program we have developed for incarcerated youth and youth at risk based on the Peacemaker Institute's Integral Peacemaker Certificate Training program offered to the public.  PTF participants learn mindfulness-awareness meditation, body-mind synchronization, nonviolent communication, conflict resolution, and leadership skills, all grounded in the experience and context of mindfulness-awareness meditation and contemplative spirituality. The program is presented in a nonsectarian manner and is open to participants of any faith and/or those who do not identify with a particular faith tradition.   The participants develop greater self-awareness, improved impulse control, greater social awareness and relationship, communication and leadership skills that will give them a new vision for their lives and how they could contribute to their communities.  The class is taught by experienced and certified meditation instructors, who have also been trained in our Peacemaker Certification program and are skilled in facilitating groups learning nonviolent communication, conflict resolution, and wisdom based forms of leadership.
