  <description>This foundation was created to honor the memory of Aubrey Michelle Clark who died at the tender age of 22 in September of 2005 from complications of an eating disorder.

Aubrey was always helping others even when she could not help herself. This foundation is devoted to continuing her legacy of helping others, especially those who are affected by eating disorders.

The Aubrey's Song Foundation takes its name from a song written to honor the great memories Aubrey left her family and countless friends. The song is found on the website www.aubreyssong.org.  Please give it a look when you have time.
