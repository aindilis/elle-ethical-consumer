  <description>I am training to participate in the Nike Marathon in San Francisco as a member of The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training. All of us on Team In Training are raising funds to help stop leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma from taking more lives. I'm completing this event in honor of all individuals who are battling blood cancers. These people are the real heroes on our team, and we need your support to cross the ultimate finish line - a cure! 

Please make a donation to support my participation in Team In Training and help advance the Society's mission
