  <description>Inform the public of the danger of being overweight. Obesity is a growing problem throughout the Western part of the World. I feel it is imperative that parents take responsbility to prevent possible overweight in their children. Please support this cause by donating to Save the Children and by not encouraging obesity in your fellow man/woman.

Obesity is not only an aesthetical issue of great importance, it also indirectly contributes to famine in third world countries. 

1. Obesity should not exist 

2. Obesity should not co-exist with famine

3. Everyone can excercise and be conscious of their diet</description>
