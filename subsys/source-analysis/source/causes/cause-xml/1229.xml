  <description>Congenital HI is a disorder in which the insulin cells of the pancreas (beta cells) secrete too much insulin and at the wrong time. Excess insulin causes low blood sugar. Ordinarily, beta cells secrete just enough insulin to keep the blood sugar normal. With HI, the secretion of insulin is not properly regulated, causing excess insulin secretion and low blood sugar.

Normal blood sugar is 70 - 100 mg/dL. Anything less than 60 mg/dL is low, although severe symptoms due to hypoglycemia are not likely unless the blood sugar is below 50 mg/dL. Prolonged or severe low blood sugar can cause seizures or permanent brain damage.

Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) is the leader in research for HI in the USA.
