  <description>The number of needy orphans in Iraq is perhaps greater than that in any other country. Iraq has suffered under a brutal dictator for more than 25 years, and continues to suffer from insecurity and internal strife. Every day, fathers die due to avoidable causes and small children are deprived of their love and care as well as their financial support. More than half of the orphans under LFT&#8217;s care in the holy city of Karbala have lost their fathers to some kind of violent incident, be it execution by Saddam&#8217;s regime, a car explosion or a terrorist attack. Those who died of disease frequently died due to lack of medical facilities or money to pay for treatment. 

No amount of financial assistance will ever be able to replace any father&#8217;s loving care and eradicate from the minds of these children those dreadful minutes when their fathers lost their lives, in some cases in front of their own eyes. However, with a mere GBP 10 (USD 20.00) per month, you can at least ease their poverty and enable them to rebuild their lives and make a fresh beginning, as well as gain blessings for yourself.
