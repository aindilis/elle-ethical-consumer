  <description>There are women being raped, killed, sterilized, starved, etc. accross seas right now. They are int he same position as the Comfort Women who were fed only rice and Miso Soup while they were lured into prostitution by recruiters making them believe they were going to nurse the wounded in the war. These women are suffering daily. They are being beaten, raped, starved, sterlized, contracting STD's, and under imprisonment by soldiers. We must do something pr-active to relieve these women. If you have any ideas, please share them with me. As far as I know, I can only start funding the women to better conditions and to maybe later save their lives. They are not objects. They are human beings with rights that have been ripped with the flesh from their fingertips. We MUST help in any way we possibly can.

1. The Women need healthcare.

2. These women should be trafficed to a safer place or given better living conditions until they can be released.

3. We need to start a party of military (which the funding will go to) to rescue as many of these women as posible.

4. We must publicize exactly what's going on and exploit the events in the middle east and asia. 

5. Try bring justice and freedom to these poor souls.</description>
