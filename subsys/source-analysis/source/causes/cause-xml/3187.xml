  <description>Music creates an invisible bond between its audience members; they listen together, they feel together.  This shared emotion puts each person on the same level, for everyone is equal in their experience and their existence.  As musicians, it is our responsibility to perform in order to promote this feeling of unity.  By doing so, we can create infinite bonds between people of all backgrounds.  Similarly, as audience members, we can enjoy music and acknowledge the connection we have with the other listeners and ultimately with the rest of the world.

"Music is the universal language."  

1. Music encourages tolerance and brings people together

2. We must participate in music to promote unity and understanding

3. Funds raised through this website will help pay for the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra to come to the U.S. for a "world peace" tour.</description>
