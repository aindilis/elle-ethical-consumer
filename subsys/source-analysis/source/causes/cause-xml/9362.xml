  <description>I believe that we,I mean they need help in rectifying this state of homewreckingness.  We...steups..they need to realise this is wrong and whether it is done on purpose or unconciously, the problem needs to be addressed and a solution found.
Remember...admitting you have a problem is the first step!
Be blessed

1. the guilty ones must be helped (or beat down)

2. men should also be blamed for straying

3. we should get some shopping money donated (cause u know when we shoppin we doh be on allyuh man, so dat will help right??)</description>
