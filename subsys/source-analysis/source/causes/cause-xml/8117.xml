  <description>In this world of ours, cities are becoming more and more important, while nation-states are losing power in contrast to the globalized economic structure. Only flexible, yet progressive and creative institutions will be able to face the new challenges posed by our era.

Montreal is a dynamic, rich, creative and progressive place to live. By becoming a country, it will be able to succeed where Canada has failed. And since Quebec is now a province dominated by backwards conservative grudging against Montreal; since the Quebec separatists almost all live in Montreal; and since Anglo-Montrealers have no real allegiance to the province; why not reunite all these motivations in a new entity:

Montreal, one island, one state!
Montr&#233;al, une &#238;le un pays!
&#161;Montreal, una isla, un estado!
Montreal, un'isola, una dichiara!
Montreal, eine Insel, ein Zustand!
Montreal, um console, um estado!

1. Make Montr&#233;al the only official multilingual city-state in the world

2. Promote a real progressive agenda and stick with it</description>
