  <description>Ending discrimination against Nicholas Schreve to ensure he doesn't become a suicidial maniac. In our expert opinion we believe many people need to join this group because its time to become better human beings and not cut down his self esteem because its too easy.


steps-

1. realize you have a problem
2. realize there are more than just one Nick Screve out there, and by helping this unfortunate one you will feel and slowly become a better person and active part of the community.
3. cut down on the name calling
4. if you dont have anything nice to say, don't say it to him. (we didnt say end the name calling about him, to your friends yet)
5. use compliments to embrace your friendship with him and continue to build his self esteem.
6. dont go to fast food restaurants with him as much so you can assure he will get a heathier choice of food. 


((more to come)) but i do not believe anyone will get past the first step.
