  <description>Kicking For Kids Who Can't is an event taking place on the National Mall on October 7th, 2007. On that day, kids and adults of all ages will kick with all of their might to raise money to benefit the Limbs For Life Foundation, a Non-Profit 501(c)(3), which provides prosthetic limbs for everyone who cannot afford them.


Anyone can kick, and they can kick in pretty much any way they want. We'll have kickball kickers, soccer kickers, and karate kickers, and if someone can think of another kick, we'll let them do that too. 

For more information, visit the website at www.kickingforkidswhocant.org

or email the event founder Ginna Goodenow at gingood@yahoo.com
