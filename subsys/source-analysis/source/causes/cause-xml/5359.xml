<cause>
  <description>&lt;b&gt;Hunger is a worldwide issue that affects millions.  Most of the world's hungry people are present in the Indian Subcontinent. Africa and the rest of Asia together have approximately 40%, and the remaining hungry people are found in Latin America and other parts of the world. Half of all children under five years of age in South Asia and one third of those in sub-Saharan Africa are malnourished.   &lt;/br&gt;
    
       Hunger is a problem, that most of us don't pay any attention to. It's a much bigger issue than we think, considering that every 3.6 seconds, someone dies of this cause. It is estimated that about 16,000 children die per day due to hunger. At this rate, there are almost 6 million children dying every year from this cause. &lt;/br&gt;

       When a family that lives in a poor country cannot grow enough food or earn enough money to purchase food, there is nowhere to turn for help. There isn't enough being done to help stop this cause, and it's about time that we spread the word and start taking action!
&lt;/b&gt;
