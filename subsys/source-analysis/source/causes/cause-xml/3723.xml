  <description>Hey everyone! We all need to pull together to stop this genocide in Darfur. Its not easy but it can be done. Already people are doing so much between fundraisers (concerts, dances, dollare for darfur..), protests, and information sessions and lawn signs... yes lawn signs! At savedarfur.org you can purchase a "Not on Our Watch" lawn sign. They show everyone how much you care. People have already asked me what my lawn sign means and how they can get one! it is amazing. There are only 2 in west Hartford (that ive seen) we need to get more on the lawns. It is a great way to donate to the cause and educate others!
Lawn sign- $4
Car magnets- $3
T-shirts- $10
wrist bants- 10 for $15 
Big banner (very cool)- $35 

Help support the cause and get a lawn sign&#8230; it&#8217;s a simple thing! 
The genocide will stop with your help! 

I will take a picture of every "Not on Our Watch" lawn sign i see or car magnets or people in the t shirts&#8230; whatever I see Darfur I will take a picture of!.... get your picture here!
