  <description>As a young girl, Jama Hedgecoth would bring home injured and orphaned animals, nurse them back to health and find homes for them. She had a vision of one day opening a facility that would be a home for abused, orphaned, and troubled children as well as a rehabilitation center for wildlife and other abused, injured, and orphaned animals. As the Founder and Director of Noah's Ark Animal Rehabilitation Center, Inc. and Noah's Ark Children's Care Home's, Inc., Jama, her husband Charlie, family, staff, volunteers and financial supporters are working to achieve this.
Jama facilitated the development of natural habitats for animals, built an animal rehabilitation facility/clinic, nature trails, as well as a welcome center, training, and administration building. Added to this is a Residential Group Home which houses children ages birth through 17.
Jama's desire to help both people and animals led to the inception of Noah's Ark. The philosophy of Noah's Ark is to bring children and animals together to provide a unique approach to rehabilitation for both. The mission of Noah's Ark is "bringing children and animals together for the purpose of providing unconditional love, unconditional service, and a future full of hope." The animals at the rehabilitation center play a large role in providing unconditional love needed by the children. This, along with a great need for children's care homes, makes Noah's Ark a vital refuge for many hurting children and animals.
