  <description>This is a knitting cause for people in the Springfield, MA USA area to knit warm items for homeless people, under privaledged babies and children and people with illnesses.

You can help by knitting a warm hat, scarf, mittens, gloves, blanket or swatch.

7 by 9 inch swatch! 
If you are knitting a swatch. Use size 7 needles (or size required to obtain gauge) The gauge is 5 stitches equals one inch. Cast on 35 stitches and knit until piece measures 9 inches long. Bind off. 

We will find someone who can sew to join the pieces together and make blankets together! This is a good  project for people who are learning to knit, or need to practice measuring their gauge. It is also a good way to use small balls of yarn left from finished projects. 

Please share patterns for warm items and share your progress with the other supporters!
