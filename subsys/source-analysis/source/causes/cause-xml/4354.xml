  <description>Burger King is donating $100,000 to a worthy cause in New Orleans. But here's the catch, the public votes for who wins. 

City Park used to be one of the greatest parks in New Orleans, and is on it's way back, but it survives on barely any funding as it is. Many children of the city have spent countless hours in Story Land, on pic-nics, walking under majestic oak tress. So please take twenty seconds and go to this website and vote for City Park.
