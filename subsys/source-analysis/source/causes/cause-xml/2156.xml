  <description>This group should serve to show that, in fact, outsourcing is a great thing for the economy. 

Think about yourself and/or your family: the more money you have, the more services you can outsource so you can focus on things you would rather do. Less wealthy people must cook, clean, do errands/housework, etc. By contrast, wealthier people can outsource these services to other people so they can focus on things that are better served to improve their lives. 

To complete the analogy, as the wealthiest nation in the world, it is greatly advantageous for us to outsource the work that Americans can receive cheaper and focus on that which will raise the standard of living and make everyone wealthier. 

1. Outsourcing lowers costs for all Americans in innumerable ways.

2. Outsourcing allows for the focus on more service, research, and other fields that raise our standard of living. 

3. The lower costs of goods and the higher standard of living will guarantee America's high level of economic growth and wealth.

4. Protectionist policies are not only very inefficient and detrimental to all other Americans (besides those being protected), and it is delaying the inevitable nature of the consumer.

5. In light of this, the American government should still help those who are already in outsourceable fields financially and with new education/training. </description>
