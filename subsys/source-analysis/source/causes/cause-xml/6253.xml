  <description>The National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC) provides information to expectant parents, healthcare professionals, and the general public about non-therapeutic circumcision, genital integrity, and human rights.

NOCIRC plans to exhibit at the American Baby Fair this fall in Uniondale, New York. This will be a great opportunity to provide accurate information to the people who need it the most, expectant parents. At last year's NY Baby Fair NOCIRC volunteers distributed over 1,000 information packets during the week-end.

1. Circumcision of healthy boys is medically unnecessary according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.

2. Circumcision removes the most sensitive parts of the penis. The foreskin is the most sensitive region of the intact penis and is more sensitive than the most sensitive region of the circumcised penis.

3. For effective HIV protection you must always use a condom whether you are circumcised or intact.

4. Approximately 70% of the world&#8217;s male population has intact genitals. The current circumcision rate in the U.S. is about 50%.</description>
