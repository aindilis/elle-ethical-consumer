  <description>Asperger's syndrome is unlike other forms of autism. Persons with AS are often high functioning members of society with markedly atypical social and communications skills. 

Although AS is beginning to be recognized and understood more today, thousands of children each year are misdiagnosed as Attention Deficit (ADD and ADHD). This misdiagnosis means that they will not get the help they need to overcome the challenges of being autistic poses.  

Likewise, until recently, many young adults and adults were not diagnosed and struggle everyday to deal with stimgas of a disability that is either not understood or is misunderstood by so many. The lack of understanding has increased the difficult of many Aspies (those with Asperger's) to become even more reclusive and farther impact their social and communicative difficulties.

1. Increase an understanding of Asperger's Syndrome

2. Provide support to person's with Asperger's, their families and friends

3. Help professionals to learn the signs of Asperger's early on to prevent misdiagnosis and get proper support for the child

4. Aid families in advocating on behalf of their child(ren) with AS to get correct Individualized Education Plans (IEPs)</description>
