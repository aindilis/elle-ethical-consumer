Hi Friends,

I have some exciting news!  I will be going abroad again! This time I will be teaching in Morocco for three weeks!  I hope you will consider helping me and those students I end up teaching by donating to my program fee.  This fee does not in any way go towards my own plane fee etc, but to the organization, Cross Cultural Solutions.

Online payments can be Mastercard or Visa

Tax documents can also be received by emailing: finance@crossculturalsolutions.org

Thank you all for your time and support!

DONATE $1.00 if you're strapped for cash? Every little bit helps!

PLEASE DONT USE THE DONATION BUTTON BELOW AND USE THE WEBSITE ABOVE TO DONATE INSTEAD.  THANKS ALL!!
