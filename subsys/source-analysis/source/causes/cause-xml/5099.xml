  <description>A dying seal spews blood after being "stunned". 

------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that the only way to sway the sealers and the Canadian fishing industry (the most powerful force behind the slaughter) is by hitting them where it counts: their pocketbook. But to succeed, people need to know about this boycott. That's why we need your help today.

MOST sealers are fishermen. Seal products are illegal in the U.S, but these fishermen sell their seafood here. This is our direct response. 

* Many seafood companies lobby for the seal kill. One of them owns one of 2 seal processing companies. Others think they&#8217;ll catch more cod if they kill off the seals. And those companies that don&#8217;t actively lobby for the kill either quietly support the massacres or are too timid to challenge government policies. This boycott will encourage all to demand an end to the killing!!
