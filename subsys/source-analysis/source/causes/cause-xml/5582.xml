  <description>Dakota Woodlands is the only short term housing facility for homeless women and children in Dakota County, MN. Families stay as long as necessary to move from homelessness to homes of their own. During this time, residents are provided with a variety of services and education which address the issues related to homelessness and help them to successfully obtain and maintain permanent housing. We&#8217;ve been here for 25 years of successful service.

The mission of Dakota Woodlands is to empower homeless women to create stable futures for their families. For more information, see www.dakotawoodlands.org
&#8226;	Over 84% of our residents move on to safe, affordable housing. 
&#8226;	Last year we served 131 families with 162 children, for a total of 293.  21 families at a time at our gorgeous facility. 
&#8226;	Dakota Woodlands also provides supportive services to former residents
