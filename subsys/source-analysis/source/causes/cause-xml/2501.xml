  <description>On May 16th 2007 at 11:45 pm Josh posted a note letting the world know that he no longer desired to be with us anymore in this lifetime.

He left behind a lot of people that loved him and a lot of broken hearts and a lake of tears.  This isn't just for him, this is for anyone and everyone that has lost someone to suicide.  

No one can take back what happened but we can try to prevent this once again in the future.  To those that are no longer with us, may they rest peacefully now and one can only hope that they have been released from their pain.

This isn't just about raising money, it's about awareness, support and prevention.

All procceds go to the Suicide Prevention Action Network Usa Inc.  I couldn't find one specifically for Oregon ( the state he lived in) so I chose this one instead since it's more US based.

Rest well Josh, those of us that knew you, loved you and we miss you A LOT!

Thank you to EVERYONE that has joined, I really appreciate your support!
