  <description>Up 'til Dawn is a student-run organization on campus to raise money for St. Jude Children's Hospital in Memphis, TN where childhood cancer research and treatment are offered free-of-charge to any child or family in need.  Whatever isn't covered by insurance is waived, and if a family has no insurance, they're not asked for any payment.  

The hospital, founded by Danny Thomas, runs 100% on donations, and organizations like Up 'til Dawn are forming across the country to raise money for these noble efforts.  

Please find it in your heart to donate any money you can, because in the words of Danny Thomas, "No child should die in the dawn of life."  

1. Since its opening in 1962, St. Jude has treated children from all 50 states and more than 70 foreign countries.

2. The Hospital costs over $1 Million a day to run

3. Research findings at St. Jude are freely shared with doctors and scientists all over the world.

4. Acute Lymphoblastic Lukemia (ALL) has gone from having a survival rate of 4 percent to having one of 90 percent since the Hospital's opening thanks to research and treatment protocols developed at St. Jude.</description>
