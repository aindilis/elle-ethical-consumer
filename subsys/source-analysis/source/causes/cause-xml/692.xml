  <description>As a nation, we honor TV dinners every March, catfish every June and ice cream every July. Yet there is currently no national day of recognition for our heroic first responders.

The First Response Coalition is working to right this wrong, and is calling on you to help us establish September 25 as "National First Responder Appreciation Day".

Help us tell Congress that the firefighters, police officers and emergency medical workers who protect our communities deserve a national day of recognition. Sign the petition today at http://www.fixtheradios.org/campaign/nfrad_petition, and make a tax-deductible donation to support FRC's efforts.
