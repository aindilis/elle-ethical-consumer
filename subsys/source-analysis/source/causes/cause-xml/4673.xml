  <description>Parents have never understood or have been fair... So I&#8217;m hoping that we will all share our complaints and one day our parents will understand and it will eat away at their insides while they think of how horrible they have treated us. I hope that they will fall to their feet in pain as their consciences slice their throats and they no longer have their voice boxes to verbally abuse us with.

1. All teens deserve to be heard

2. Parents deserve to die..

3. Parents are Leagaly retarded.</description>
