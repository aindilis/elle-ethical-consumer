  <description>My mother passed away from Scleroderma in 2002 after an 18 year battle. 

Through this facebook group I am trying to raise not only funds but awarness of the disease. All funds raised in honor and memory for those who have been personally affected by this disease go directly to the Scleroderma Foundation. 

Just remember the $1 you donate could fund the test-tube that the cure is found in.

No amount is too little. 

1. No one should ever have to deal with this horrible disease.

2. Just remember the $1 you donate could fund the test-tube that the cure is found in.</description>
