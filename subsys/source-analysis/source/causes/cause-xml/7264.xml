  <description>Cabaret is a non-profit, 501c3 organization designed to bring national artists to the city of Pittsburgh and express them through the art of cabaret.  We also expand ourselves to use those artists to provide master classes, workshops, and forums for inspiring artists and professionals.  Cabaret Pittsburgh even does it's best to put local talent on the map, creating a great environment for networking and meeting other industry professionals.  We are currently looking into showcasing our events "live and in person" via the internet, and could use donations to do so.  THANK YOU so much for your support!

1.  	We define cabaret as an intimate, musical or theatrical experience that celebrates the individual creative spirit.

2.  	We believe that music and singing can be a universal communicator, can be used as a catalyst to bring together diverse communities, and can initiate dialogue to bring better understanding to the unfamiliar.

3.  	We have the desire to succeed - and upon that success &#8211; we wish to expand our educational value to other cities and places that are proven to be deficient from such activities.</description>
