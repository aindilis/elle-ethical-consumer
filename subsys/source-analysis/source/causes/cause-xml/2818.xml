  <description>Our vision is a community in which: 

All pets are provided with adequate food, shelter, medical care, companionship and appropriate training 

No adoptable pets are euthanized 

All companion pets are spayed or neutered 

All pets are wanted and considered a part of the family 

The Humane Society is considered the &#8216;pet source of choice&#8217; for responsible pet owners. 




1. Promoting responsible pet care through public education and services
