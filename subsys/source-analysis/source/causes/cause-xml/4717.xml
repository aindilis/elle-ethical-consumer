  <description>Well we Muslims are so overwhelmed with problems, and we don't know how to fix them.
but there is one problem I'm quiet sure if we fix it the other problems will simply be fixed fast.
WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER, If we are to better our Selves.

1. Disscuss the solutions not the problems.

2. Make a stand together.

3. Never point fingers at each other.</description>
