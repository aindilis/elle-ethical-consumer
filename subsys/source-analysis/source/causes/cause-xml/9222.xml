  <description>Islamic Relief donors are now sponsoring over 20,000 orphans in 21 countries worldwide. From Indonesia to Mali, the lives of thousands of orphans are being transformed by our sponsors.

Losing one or both parents is traumatic for any child in any situation. In countries where war, famine or poverty are a part of everyday life, millions of children are orphaned and left to struggle for survival.

Islamic Relief has been working with orphans since 1986, and now has projects in over 20 countries across the world. Our One-to-One Sponsorship Programme gives you the chance to support an orphaned child in Asia, Africa, the Middle East or Eastern Europe.

With your help we can give these children the care they need, providing them with food, shelter, healthcare, education and emotional support.

The Holy Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) said:
"I and the person who looks after an orphan will be in Paradise
together like this..." - then he raised his forefinger
and middle finger together.
(Hadith Bukhari)

1. Every orphan child has the right to a normal life.

2. Every orphan child has the right to a safe life.

3. Every orphan child has the right to a life with dignity.</description>
