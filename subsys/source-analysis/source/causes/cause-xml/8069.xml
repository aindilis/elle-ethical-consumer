  <description>AsiaLink is a Christian mission agency connecting churches in the UK and Ireland with ministry among the unreached peoples of Asia. Our passion is the challenge of those who have little or no opportunity to hear the gospel.

We are convinced that the task of the local Church and of each believer is to assume responsibility for Christian mission and will do all we can to awaken and encourage missionary vision. We firmly believe that God wants churches in the UK and Ireland to work alongside Him to fulfil the Great Commission. A critical feature of AsiaLink&#8217;s work is the investment we make in these congregations.

AsiaLink partners with national believers throughout several countries of Asia including China, Borneo, Vietnam, Laos, Mongolia, Bhutan and Kashmir. Within these countries alone there are approximately 1,000 unreached people groups

All donations will go to Asia Harvest (Director: Paul Hattaway, author of the Heavenly Man), our close friends and partner organization.

1. AsiaLink is committed to Biblical Truth, to ministry through prayer and to dependence upon God for all our needs.

2. We affirm historic, evangelical Christianity

3. AsiaLink guarantees 100% of donations will be used as designated (Asia Harvest)</description>
