  <description>For too long, 87 years to be exact, women have been able to voice their opinion. Why must we disgrace the founding forefathers in this manner? The 19th amendment goes against everything that this country was built upon and insults the men of this country who put they're life on the line for freedom as the women were at home. Where to this day, they belong. With this cause, we hope to show the world the importance of abolishing women's suffrage and the benefits of restoring this country to the means of which it was founded on.

1. no 19th amendment </description>
