  <description>More people need to think of looking to animal shelters/humane societies before going to a breeder when they are in search of a new pet. 


People need to have their pets spayed and neutered so they won't contribute to the number of unwanted animals. Even the fact that the puppies would find homes quickly doesn't make breeding right. Shelter dogs deserve a chance to have a loving and forever home, and by breeding your dog you are ruining a shelter dogs chances. 


People should look at shelters before buying purebred pets. Shelter dogs often make better pets, and don't have all the breed specific medical problems of purebred animals. 


Please adopt from your local shelter. If you can't adopt, consider fostering. If you can't do either, please donate. Your donations help to save lives. 

1. All pets should be spayed or neutered.

2. People should look at shelters before buying a purebred pet.
