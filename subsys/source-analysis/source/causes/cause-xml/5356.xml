  <description>Last week at pizza hut, I worked for 33.00 hours. My paycheck was only for $175.02 after taxes. I have no money to pay my rent, I have no money to buy food. Everything I had was spent the first day i cashed my check on those two things. I still owe $118.00 for rent and there is no way I'll be able to get the money before it's due. 

I told my boss, Lisa (828) 586-1910, to either give me a raise or fire me. I called the Pizza Hut corporate office (1-972-338-7700) and asked them why everyone working there still made minimum wage. They told me my HR director would call me and explain the situation. I am still waiting for a call from both these individuals.

It has to start somewhere, it has to start sometime. Why can't this be the generation that stands up to corporate america and says, "Hey, we're not gonna let you rip us off anymore." We're not gonna work 40 hours a week in a hell hole like Pizza Hut for minimum wage with no heath insurance or any benifits of any kind. 



1. Sustainable wage is essential to the right of the individual to pursue happiness.

2. Medical care and Health insurance should be provided to all citizens in this country free of charge.

3. Corporations are not people. Nor do they have the rights of people.

4. Emancipation from Corporate Wage Slavery.</description>
