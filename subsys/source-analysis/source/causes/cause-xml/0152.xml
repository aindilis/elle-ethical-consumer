  <description>The genocide in Darfur is one of the greatest preventable tragedies in the world today.  This is an issue that people on Facebook and our generation in general have shown a great concern for.  It has been declared a genocide by the US government.  The world community can prevent this tragedy, yet it goes on.  Let's show the world that the young people of America are not just talk, and are willing to make even a small sacrifice of ten dollars to show our support.  

1. Facebook members care about the genocide in Darfur, and are willing to act.

2. Genocide is a crime against humanity, and it is the responsibility of the world community to do whatever it can to stop genocide.</description>
