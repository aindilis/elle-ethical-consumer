  <description>For those of you who do not know what is bleeding disorder here is a quick description of the two most common disorders. 

Hemophilia: Hemophilia is a lifelong bleeding disorder that prevents blood from clotting properly. People with hemophilia do not have enough clotting factor, a protein in blood that controls bleeding. The severity of a person&#8217;s hemophilia depends on the amount of clotting factor that is missing. 

vWD: vWD is caused by a deficiency or defect of a blood clotting protein called von Willebrand factor (vWF), a gluelike protein that helps platelets in the blood stick together and seal off tears in injured blood vessels. This is called a platelet plug. If a person does not have enough vWF or it does not work properly, no platelet plug will form and bleeding will continue for a longer period of time. 


With proper treatment, people with a bleeding disorder live relatively normal lives. Without treatment, most children with severe hemophilia or vWD will die young. An estimated 400,000 people worldwide are living with a bleeding disorder. Only 25% receive adequate treatment. The World Federation of Hemophilia is striving to close this gap. So please help support our cause.



1. Everyone should have access to proper medical care. 

2. No child should be crippled by an untreated joint bleed.

3. Health care is a universal right.</description>
