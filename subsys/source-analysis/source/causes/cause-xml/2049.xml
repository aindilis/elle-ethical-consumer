  <description>With the Armed Career Criminal Act and many other laws, at both federal and state level, came an enormous increase in drug offenders in our prisons. The rate a prisoner returns to crime after release is nearly 67% now, and has been rising since these laws were put in place.

What does this prove? Prisons don't rehabilitate substance abusers. In fact, it's been a second home for people who think trafficking drugs is the only way they'll ever make a difference. Every year more teenagers and young adults are pumped into federal and state prisons to show America we are "tough on crime," but what we really are is tough on taxpayers.

Federal inmates cost in excess of $25,000 a year to house. Rehabilitation costs a fraction of this price, is generally a smaller sentence, and yields greater decreases in recidivism than any other program available.

Advocate; save money for us and rehabilitate the people who really need it. Re-entry programs work on a community-level. We need to show offenders and law-abiding citizens caring about the community and giving back--either by giving a convict a second chance or repaying the community for a crime committed against it--is worthwhile for everyone.

1. Substance abuse offenders need more than lock-up.

2. Longer jail sentences don't heal any wounds.

3. Prisons should exist only to keep violent criminals away from the general public.</description>
  <mission>We aim to prove "stiffer punishment" for lesser crimes sucks tax-payers dry and doesn't rehabilitate the offender.</mission>
