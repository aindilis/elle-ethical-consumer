  <description>Dr. Mehmet Oz, longtime frequent guest on the Oprah show, has a disturbing secret.  He is one of the top 10 people on PETA's hit list.  He is head of research at Columbia University, and under his direction, animals - especially puppies, were and are being repeatedly killed inhumanely after having produced no new medical information to the scientists, and having been born only to be tortured and murdered.  Dr. Mehmet Oz himself was investigated years ago for the inhumane euthanization of eight young labrador puppies:  he and his team "euthanized" them by placing all eight in a garbage bag and stabbing them each in the heart with a venom-containing needle.  (Not by any means a normal euthanization process!) Although the University has been investigated on more than one occasion due to several claims of animal cruelty during their research, no charges have stuck against Dr. Oz, and now he is being portrayed as a saint almost weekly on the Oprah Winfrey show. 

1. Dr. Mehmet Oz should never be allowed to touch another animal again!!

2. Protect those creatures that cannot protect themselves!!

3. Show your support...and together we'll write to Columbia University and lend our support to PETA!!</description>
