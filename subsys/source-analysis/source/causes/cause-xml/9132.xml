  <description>My friend and compadre, Jesse Bennett, is a resident gamer from Louisville, Kentucky; and a known Dance Dance Revolution player.  He had his leg amputated in high school and got a prosthetic leg, and in 2003 he began playing Dance Dance Revolution.  Since then, he has become a phenomenon amongst the DDR community; and has been featured in the Courier Journal of Louisville, Ketucky and Spike TV's Fresh Baked Video Games.  After four years of playing the game, gaining 15 AAA's (perfect scores) on some of the hardest songs in the game, his prosthetic leg is showing signs of severe wear and tear.  This cause was started to raise money to get this kid a new prosthetic leg or some good repair to his old one since his insurance won't cover it.

The main beneficiary of this cause is actually Options for Individuals Incorporated, people who offer insurance plans for those like Jesse.  There will be various events around Louisville that will directly benefit the fund.

Let's do what we can to support others like him who are disabled, let's get them on their (prosthtic) feet and dance!

1. Any handicapable person can play dance or music games even if they are disabled.  It is NOT a requirement that a person has two legs to play the game well.

2. There are individuals with disabilities and handicaps that participate in special olympic events designed for them.  There are video game devices and other HID's that allow these individuals to play certain console and arcade games that require full body </description>
