  <description>Focus on Jesus Ministries and Real Bean Entertainment, LLC are working together to produce a plethora of family-friendly, positive and God-honoring entertainment. 

After producing two full seasons of a successful Christian sitcom which is currently airing worldwide, Focus on Jesus and Real Bean will be working together this August of 2007 to produce a one-hour Series Finale to conclude the Completing Kaden television series as well as a feature film entitled 'God's Only Forgotten'. Both productions are very well written with a very moving storyline that will be sure to touch the hearts of many. 

The Gospel message is very clearly woven into both productions in a non-threatening, non-preachy, but very real and relavant way. 

1. The Entertainment Industry is the largest most listened to medium in the world.

2. Flooding the market with positive, uplifting films means there won't be room for the trash that Hollywood's been producing for years. </description>
