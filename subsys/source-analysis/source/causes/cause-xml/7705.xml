  <description>The goal of Anchoring Peace is to hold the frequencies of Peace, Love, and Unity as a people. By being these qualities in our daily lives we help to bring them into our daily existance in a way that offers them as a genuine example to be replicated by others. Initially inspired by the movement to &lt;a href="http://www.firethegird.org"&gt;fire the grid&lt;/a&gt;, we aim to carry on in light of this important event and extend these qualities to others as the miracle of creation unfolds daily. Anchoring Peace rides on the belief that energy systems syncopate naturally. As the qualities of Peace, Love, and Unity become more universally accepted they will naturally cause other nearby energy systems to harmonize with the same frequency.

1. Peace

2. Love

3. Unity</description>
