  <description>Niemann-Pick is a diesease that many kids are faced with. Along with many other disease, it is one that deprives them of alot of "normal" activities. There are many 3 types of this disease. Here is a paragraph writen by the parents of Lee King, a boy that has the disease:

"Our son Lee is now 15 years old. In 1997, he was diagnosed at the age of six with Niemann-Pick Type C. Over the last nine years, we have painfully watched him go from a normal, energetic, happy child to one one no longer walks, talks or eats. Niemann-Pick has robbed us all from so much "life". Almost from the beginning of Lee's diagnosis, we have been fund-raising for Niemann-Pick research. At first, it was in slow desperate need to sace our son. But slowly, it has become something so much more. Almost once a month, another family receives this diagnosis; that means thatt another monther and father have been told that their child is dying, and they need to be prepared for feeding tubes, wheelchairs, breathing machines, seizures, numerous hospital visits with pneumonia, and eventuallu planning their child's funeral."

As I read this paragraph yesterday I knew I wanted to do something to help!
