  <description>There are thousands of people in need of a kidney transplant.  In Canada and the U.S. alone the numbers are staggering, please visit www.kidney.ca and www.kidney.org and www.livingdonorsonline.org to find out more.  I have always been a big supporter of organ donation, but last year it touched me personally when I donated a kidney to my father.  I watched him get his life back and have since been doing what I can to educate and inform by sharing my experience.  You can save a life by giving a piece of yourself. Whether you are a living donor, or choose to donate your organs by becoming a registered donor, organ donation is the greatest gift you can give.  Donate life.

Please invite others to join in the cause, lets make a difference!!

1. Opening eyes to the number of people in need
