  <description>Too many teens are getting pregnant. Face it, teens are not capable of caring for a human just yet...so the pregnant teens get an abortion. This is murder. Sure its a dim way to look at it but its the truth. This pro life cause is put into action to raise awareness.

Approximately 126,000 abortions occur daily worldwide. This is a very grim statistic and people need to know of these horrifying numbers.


1. Everyone has the right to life.

2. The unborn are helpless. Be their voice.

3. If we all raise our voices, we can help put an end to abortion.</description>
