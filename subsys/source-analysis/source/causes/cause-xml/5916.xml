  <description>As a Canadian, I have grown up without much knowledge of the Natives who live along side me. The only knowledge I have is from major media and political annoucements. I would like to start this cause on "The Day of Action" as a board for Canadians and Natives of Canada, to discuss history, culture and ways to a future together. This is a cause of education and communication that is much needed. 

I do not know the non profit group, so do not donate without reading what they are about. Thank you.

1. To encourage education and communication between Natives of Canada and Canadians

2. To learn from the past, and build bridges for the future</description>
