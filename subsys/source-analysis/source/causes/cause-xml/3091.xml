  <description>The following is from a letter by Jaci Winship, Executive Director of Missourians Against Human Cloning:

"While the vote on November 7th disappointed thousands of Missourians who had worked with unselfish dedication to spread the truth about Amendment 2, the vote was alson an amazing achievement. A year ago, Missourians Against Human Cloning was little more than a name. Coalition members knew Missourians opposed human cloning, but had to start from ground zero to battle the travesty of Amendment 2. Due primarily to the purposely misleading language of the initiative, a larg majority of voters showed early support for the amendment.

"But on November 7th, over one million people voted NO- No to biotech's expensive media blitz- NO to false promises and threats made prepeatedly in the press- NO to human cloning!"

1. Close the human cloning loophole Amendment 2 created in our constitution

2. Protect vulnerable young women, whom cloners will treat simply as a lucrative source of human eggs

3. Close the back door access to unlimited tax dollars on Amendment 2 specifically provided for the cloning researchers. Our elected representatives must be able to allocate public funds to promising stem cell research- proven, ethical, adult stem cell resea</description>
