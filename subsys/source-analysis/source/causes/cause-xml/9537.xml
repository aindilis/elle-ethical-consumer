  <description>UNITED AGAINST RACISM .... it starts here.

Racism has long run in our country. Even today as we think it has disappeared it is still occurring within some lives of people today. 

The question we have to face with our society is as follows: why does racism still exist in the greatest country in the world when it should be a thing in the past that we have overcome through struggle, war, and death??

1. People should be judged by their character not their color.

2. Prejudging a person burns their character and reputation before they even speak.</description>
