  <description>Teexas donates its money to Kiva to finance projects around the world. The purpose of this cause is to donate directly to Kiva. If you would like to buy a shirt that will benefit Kiva, please visit teexas.org.

Teexas is the first non-profit microfinancing project at the University of Texas at Austin. Our goal is empowering women in developing nations economically through interest free loans. 

But we're not asking for hand outs. To the right we'll always feature a new t-shirt design for you to purchase which will help fund our cause. After each t-shirt run, we'll add to our growing list of women we've assisted and keep you up to date on their progress. That way you'll be able to see first hand how what you've done has given these women the ability to lift themselves out of poverty.
