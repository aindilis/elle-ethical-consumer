  <description>Since 1987, AIDS Walk San Francisco has raised over $65 million for HIV /AIDS programs and services in the SF Bay Area. In 2007 alone, 25,000 participants raised a record sum of $4.6 million for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and more than 40 Bay Area HIV/AIDS organizations. 

AIDS Walk San Francisco is notable not only for its size, but also for its diversity. People of all ages, races, and backgrounds come together each year in a massive, powerful, and inspiring demonstration of compassion and action. 

Funds generated from AIDS Walk San Francisco benefit the San Francisco AIDS Foundation (SFAF). For 26 years, SFAF has provided direct services to thousands of people living with or at risk for HIV/AIDS.
