  <description>Like Kurt Vonnegut's friend made clear, we're more likely to stop glaciers than to stop war in general.  So we're going to try it.  This is a parody of any and all causes that this stupid-ass application was made for.  You guys won't do shit unless someone with more power than you already wanted it done.

1. Anti-war enthusiasts must concede that nobody (other than your typical sociopath) is "pro" war.

2. Anyone with more than three bumper stickers (of any belief system) should be shot.

3. Everyone should give Justin Lofton money.</description>
