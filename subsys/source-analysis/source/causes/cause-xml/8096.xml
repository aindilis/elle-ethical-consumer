  <description>Kaitlyn was only 16 years old when she died.  She'd been dusting keyboard cleaner in the bathtub when she passed out and drowned.  Her mother found her when she went to get her to go to Sonic.

Kaitlyn didn't intend to die. She'd just left a voice mail for a friend telling her that she was done doing that stuff and she planned to concentrate on staying clean. She intended to get high one more time, take a bath and go on her merry way.  

It didn't work out that way.  Her friends knew she was dusting but they didn't tell her parents or any other adult.  They didn't want Kaitlyn mad at them.  

Guess what? Kaitlyn's not mad...she's dead.

Kaitlyn's Promise is intended to raise awareness about the dangers of dusting, huffing, whipits and lots of other substances.  And especially to get kids to realize that adults are not the enemy!! A trusted adult needs to be told if someone they know and love is doing something dangerous like what Kaitlyn did. 

If her promise can save one life then Kaitlyn's death will not have been in vain.  

If her promise can spare just one family from going through the nightmare of having to bury a child then Kaitlyn's death will not have been in vain.  

If her promise can get just one kid to STOP doing this then Kaitlyn's death will not have been in vain.  

1. Adults are not the enemy

2. Dusting, huffing, whipits, etc. is dangerous

3. Don't be afraid to save your friend, even if it means they'll get mad</description>
