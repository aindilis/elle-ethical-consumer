  <description>The only thing that separates us from those that are suffering from HIV/AIDS is luck. It is our generation's responsibility to part with the apathetic views of the developed world and begin to fight this infectious disease with all that we can equip ourselves with; through education, preventative methods, and equity in treatment programs. 

Since 1981, an estimated 25 million people have died of AIDS. The major call for assistance comes from the developing and transitional countries where individuals lack proper treatment. It is estimated that of the 7.1 million people living in developing and transitional countries requiring life-saving AIDS drugs, only 28% are recipients. 

If we are the inheritors of the earth, it is our responsibility to ensure equality in treatment, preventative methods against infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS. The injustice that exists within the world exists solely because we become apathetic to it. Taking a stance, and fighting for equality in education, treatment and preventative measures can help eliminate the HIV/AIDS crisis.

Together, we can be the generation that sets an end to the pandemic of HIV/AIDS. Help join the fight!

1. Ensure proper education to end the social stigma and instill preventative methods against HIV/AIDS.

2. Establish equality of treatment for individuals suffering with HIV/AIDS in developing and transitional countries.  </description>
