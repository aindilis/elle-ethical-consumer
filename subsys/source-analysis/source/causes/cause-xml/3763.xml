  <description>The streets are fulled with young kids, sniffing glue, mugging tourists, and getting a jump start on a life of crime....

Some of these kids are potentailly our next president, or hold the cure to Aids. The point is, shouldnt we all be given the same chance at a good start in life......

Sure there is the belief that alot of these kids run away from home....perhaps its a drunken parent or abusive relative...whatever their reason i think this is a good cause......question is, do you?

You dont need to donate money...just help someone in ur community and tell us about it.

1. Eradicate poverty

2. Provide a fair chance
