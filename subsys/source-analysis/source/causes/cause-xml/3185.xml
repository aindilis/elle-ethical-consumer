  <description>This is the Save Joe Foundation. Never has there been an official chance to save Joe until now. Here, we can hopefully get some publicity. As many of you might know, the Save Joe Foundation has been around for years. Helping is always one of our major concerns and donations are always appreciated.

1. Joe must be saved by helpful donations.

2. Donations are required to help Joe.

3. Requiring donations helps the Foundation help Joe.</description>
