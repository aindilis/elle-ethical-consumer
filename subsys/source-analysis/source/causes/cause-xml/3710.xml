  <description>Its not rocket science.  An animals population needs to be limited in order for it to be healthy.  It may not be pretty but hunting of deer is beneficial for the overall population.  So go out every chance you get and SHOOT A DEER (preferably a doe, the buck/doe ration is way out of whack too).  Its no problem if you kill more than you can eat, you can always donate surplus deer meat to the hungry and homeless through the Hunters and farmers feeding the hungry program.

1. Deer overpopulation leads to increased deer/auto collisions with human fatalities

2. Deer overpopulation promotes the spread of lyme disease through deer ticks

3. Competition for limited food sources leads to damage to vegetation and starvation of deer

4. A good slab of fresh deer meat hot off the grill is pretty damn good</description>
