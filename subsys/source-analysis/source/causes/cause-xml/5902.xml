  <description>In support of laughter and happiness at it's best...Dane Cook. 

1. Dane Cook is the funniest man alive...everyone should believe this.

2. Dane Cook should marry ME and only ME...everyone should believe this too.

3. Everyone should live for laughter...especially made through Dane saying whatever it is he has to say at any given time. </description>
