  <description>The NGU Sport Managemet Society was created to further the education we get at NGU beyond the classroom through the students ourselves. It is important that we as students understand that what we do outside of the classroom is equally as important as what we do in it. My goal as president is to provide us with opportunities on and off campus to further our understanding of things we can do in the business world to further our future companies/employers. 

1. To provide opportunities to further education beyond the classroom

2. To provide a chance for students to meet professionals in the Sport Industry

3. To center education and an understanding of the business world around Christ

4. To provide volunteer opportunities on and off campus of NGU</description>
