  <description>Countless gnomes are being kept against their will in gardens accross South Africa and the world.  Wrest from rich, organic lives in their homeland wilderness these poor creatures are forced to decorate suburban gardens as icons of slavery and submission where onlookers often mistake the blush of shame and humiliation on their reddened cheeks for jolliness.  This cause aims to raise awareness of the plight of gnomes.  It calls on its members to refuse purchasing even the smallest shrub from nurseries who support this abominable gnome trade.  Let us work together, ghome and human alike - for the freedom of all...

1. Gnomes should enjoy the same rights to liberty as everyone else

2. the trade in gnome lives must end

3. humans and gnomes should work together for the freedom of all</description>
