  <description>Alot of people are claiming that hip-hop music is dead. I say it isn't, but it's on life support... There's far too many non believers in positive good hip hop. It's just the simple fact that we don't give enough musicians and artists the chance to be heard. Yes, radio rap may be catchy and popular, but we must not forget about the beautiful music not making it to radio waves. Some say hip-hop is rude and negative, we need to prove them wrong. 

1. Native tongue never died.

2. It doesn't matter who you like, hip-hop is hip-hop, and thats the big picture.

3. As the youth we must keep the music alive.</description>
