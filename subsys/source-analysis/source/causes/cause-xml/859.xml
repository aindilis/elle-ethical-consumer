  <description>Education and advocacy on behalf of Israel worldwide.

StandWithUs is an international education organization that ensures that Israel's side of the story is told in communities, campuses, libraries, the media and churches through brochures, speakers and conferences.

StandWithUs brings to you up to date information, resources, and tools for Israel advocacy on and off campus. We use new technologies and create fresh initiatives to reach out to today's young campus activists.

Founded in 2001 in response to the second Intifada and the misinformation that surrounded the conflict, SWU now has offices in Los Angeles, New York, Israel and Michigan, with additional campus staff in Chicago and Buffalo.

StandWithUs, the next generation of Israel Advocacy.

1. Debate concerning Israel must be balanced.

2. Students on campus do not have the necessary resources to counter anti-Israel rhetoric. StandWithUs fills that void.</description>
