  <description>A quick example - facebook causes to stop global warming. Okay so lets power up our computers and click the link for the sake of saving the planet.

Admittedly some causes are worthwile in gathering internet support. However, the act of clicking a link is simple, it requires no thought whatsoever or rational thinking.

Think about what you are joining?
Are you helping?

Using the internet to raise support for charitable organisations and causes is fast getting out of hand and quite frankly annoying.

200,000 people support our cause they boast! But in reality how many support them and how many simply clicked a link because someone invited them, not tinking before doing so.

Save the whale! Well, if 300,000 of us join up on facebook then its bound to happen.

Things only get done when you take action, when you think properly about an issue and take the approprate measures to remedy it. Pretending to care and indulging in the current click and support craze will do nothing.

Granted, some petitions and causes are worthwhile and it's usefl to show support. But they are drowned out by our desire to follow our inner Bono and support everything and sign up for everything. All the while we are diluting the real casues.

So do yourselves a favour and stop clicking these pointless links.

Yes, we do appreciate irony!

1. People don't care about the causes they join, they just click them and that's it

2. Pseudo-charity support is a step backwards, not really support</description>
