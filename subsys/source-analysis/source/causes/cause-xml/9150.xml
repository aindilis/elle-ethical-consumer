  <description>This cause is to help educate people about these misunderstood  dogs. When raised to be a part of a family and not for the owner's twisted amusement pit bulls can be the most loving and loyal dogs. The cruel training a fighting pit goes through confuses the dog at first because he wishes only to please his owner and doesn't understand why they would want to hurt them. 

1. End dog fighting

2. Bring dogfighters to justice
