  <description>The Alzheimer&#8217;s Association, the world leader in Alzheimer research and support, is the first and largest voluntary health organization dedicated to finding prevention methods, treatments and an eventual cure for Alzheimer&#8217;s.

For more than 25 years, the donor-supported, not-for-profit Alzheimer&#8217;s Association has provided reliable information and care consultation; created supportive services; increased funding for dementia research; and influenced public policy changes.

Memory Walk is a noncompetitive walk, and a festive event for families, coworkers, and friends of all ages.
