  <description>Each year over 32,653.2389 turkeys are killed because they decide to open their mouths in the rain and drown themselves. We should have them wear devices that stops them from drowning. The worst time of the year for the turkey is the thanksgiving season. It is like saying thank you God for this beautiful avian now we shall feast on it's innards. We should eat tofu turkey. Please save the turkeys. The picture shows that our President is for the killing of turkeys (This is in no way a serious put down on President Bush).

1. Turkeys are beautiful (don't kill)

2. Thank God for tofu instead of our bird friends.

3. Make device so turkeys don't drown maybe teach them how to use a straw.</description>
