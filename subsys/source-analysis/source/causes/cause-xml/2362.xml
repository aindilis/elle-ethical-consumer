  <description>As part of our operation, Give Hope Foundation has made it a priority to keep our costs as low as possible. To this end, Give Hope Foundation was founded under to have no member of the board compensated in any way whatsoever for their efforts. Additionally, we work very hard to either self perform many organizational functions such as web design and accounting. For other services, such as web hosting and printing, we have worked hard to find business partners to provide these services for us. It is in this way that our supporters may donate to us and know that their dollars are not spent to simply pay our bills, but rather that their generosity goes where it should - directly to the cause.

1. At the Second Annual Give Hope and Hold 'Em event, you all helped us raise nearly $50,000! Over 300 people attended this year's event and helped us Make a Difference for our three beneficiaries: Camp Boggy Creek, Kids Beating Cancer, and Climb for Cancer</description>
