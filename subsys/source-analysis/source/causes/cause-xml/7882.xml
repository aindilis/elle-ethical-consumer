  <description>My nephew Jake was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in January 2007. My family will be walking in the JDRF's anual 3 mile walk in October. We hoping to raise $500 to donate to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. If you want to donate log on to http://www.jdrf.org/. My entire family thanks you for any support you can give! We are walking under Team Jake.
