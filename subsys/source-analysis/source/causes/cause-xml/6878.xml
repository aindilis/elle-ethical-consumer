  <description>No disrespect to peta i am against the torture of animals too but some people are just a little to extreme and i did not climb to the top of the food chain to eat fucking carrots

PETA in this case stands for People for Eating Tasty Animals

1. torturing animals is wrong

2. eating buffalo wings is good

3. chicken noodle soup is amazing</description>
