  <description>This cause is to prohibit the shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, receiving, possessing, purchasing, selling, or donation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption, and for other purposes. Horse slaughter has become inhumane instead of merciful. Wild horses are simply being slaughtered for their meat. Hundreds of wild horse herds are slaughtered inhumanely every year. Sending a horse with a broken leg - especially a race horse, to slaughter may seem like the best option but the horse suffers a great deal in the slaughter house. Often the horse isnt properly dead when it gets slaughtered and because it is an expensive process euthanazing a horse, slaughter houses often use chainsaws, staple guns or knives to simply end a horses life. The horse you once may have loved, suffers fear, pain and abusive handling before finally being slaughtered, cut up and its meat being packed which may end up on your dinner plate. It is only slightly comforting to know that a creature once so beautiful, proud , free and strong has gone up to a better place.
