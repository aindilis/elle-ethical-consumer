  <description>Scientists have hit on a groundbreaking way of helping to avert environmental disaster - smearing the planet with mustard.

And only the English variety will do.

French mustard just doesn't cut it.

Experts believe soil full of earthworms is less likely to be flooded - the water pours down the creatures' tiny tunnels - and retains water better during drought. The problem was finding whether there were enough earthworms.

Now researchers at the Game Conservancy Trust in Loddington, Leicestershire, have solved it by mixing mustard powder with water and spreading it on the soil. As the mustard sinks in, the worms wriggle to the top to escape its pungent aroma and can be counted.
