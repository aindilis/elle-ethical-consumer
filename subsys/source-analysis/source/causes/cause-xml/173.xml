  <description>In today's world, it is incredibly difficult to find media that is not owned by a multinational corporation.  Our news, our radio stations, TV, books, billboards are owned by the few and do not benefit the many.  How are we supposed to have an informed public if the only news we get is tainted with profit motive and corporate allegiances?  We need to take action, get organized, and support independent press.  

Please post notes about your favorite sources for independent media.  We can give those magazines/newspapers/publishers/writers more exposure and more readership.  Who's your favorite?  

1. Independent media sources need to be supported and accessible to all

2. Corporate ownership over more and more of our media sources needs to be stopped</description>
