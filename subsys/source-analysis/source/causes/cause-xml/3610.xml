  <description>Some people dont know how important it is to sign one simple card - your organ donation card that comes with your licence. 

Not enough people sign that little piece of paper, or tell their loved ones they want to be a donor. 

My dad was dying in the hospital and in dire need of a liver transplant. By the time he got to the top of the transplant list, it was almost too late. Because that persons family members decided to say 'yes', i still have a dad. For that i am forever greatful. 

Please, sign your Organ Donation cards, and let your loved ones know you want to be a donor.
