  <description>Qu&#233;bec is a land of rich heritage for the those of French ancestry in North America. Now I believe is the time to recognize that Qu&#233;bec should become it's own nation due to vast differences in culture, law, and language. 

All money raised through this cause will go straight to Parti Qu&#233;b&#233;cois, who has promised the people of Quebec another referendum on sovereignty which, this time around, should get the majority.
