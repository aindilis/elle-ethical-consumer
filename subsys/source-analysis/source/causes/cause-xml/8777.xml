  <description>Sheera the Warrior Princess truck has been through so much with us.  Due to a tragic event while out having fun with friends...Sheera's mechanical heart gave out                                                                                                                                   In order for Sheera to get back on the road and out haven fun again...we need to replace her mechanical heart. She was rushed to Doctor Macano where we were told it would cost $3,000 to repair.  If anyone has any suggestion on how to raise the money...great.. also donations are more then welcome.
Thank you for supporting this cause to help a little shit get her warrior princess back.
