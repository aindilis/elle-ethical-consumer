  <description>The Electoral College:

What is the electoral college you ask? It's basically the way we vote for the president and vice president. We the citizens vote for a elector how then votes for the president. When we vote we vote for how we want the our elector to vote for.

Problem?:

Problem is that the elector doesn't always have pay any attention to how the people want to vote for, they get to choose however they want int the end. Our votes are just a suggestion. In the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore would have won the election if the government was counting the individual votes. Gore had a total of 50,996,116 individual votes, Bush had a total of
50,456,169, but in electoral votes Bush won 271 to 266. If a popular vote was put in place back then, we probably wouldn't have had to suffer eight years with a fucking moron.
On a side not, they say the voter precipitation is shrinking every year. I
think it's shrinking because the statement 'Every Vote Count =D' isn't really true now is it?

1. Every Vote Has to Count

2. Don't let the higher ups control your vote

3. Prevent the manipulation of electoral votes</description>
