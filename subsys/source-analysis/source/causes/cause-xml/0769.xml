  <description>Through analysis of taxation, it is clear that taxation is a violent aggression against the person and property of the citizen.  No company has the right to force people to buy a service, and as a consequence, they must make services that people will voluntarily pay for.  The government, on the other hand, asserts that it has the right to force everyone to pay for services, even if they vote against the services.  This inevitably leads to the corruption that runs rampant in every government.  Stop this by telling the government that it doesn't have the right to coercively pick the pocket of the people.
