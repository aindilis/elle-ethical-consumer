  <description>It is pretty obvious that the Earth is in trouble, isn't it? To summarize this cause, I must first say that there are two different kinds of environmental movements out there. There is one that is based on preserving the Earth only to meet human needs. Those who support this movement are only willing to recycle and protest enough to protect their own interests.

Deep Ecology believes that all life has a right to exist.

It believes that nature doesn't exist to serve us. It exists for it's own sake. And we are deeply a part of it.

What do you believe? 





1. The complex community of life is being threatened by human civilization.

2. We depend on this community absolutely.</description>
