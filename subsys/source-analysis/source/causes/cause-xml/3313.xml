  <description>Citizens for Global Solutions is a nationwide organization that inspires America to engage the world.  Our members recognize that in today&#8217;s interconnected world, our lives, our jobs and our families are increasingly affected by global problems.  Challenges like terrorism, climate change, failed states and infectious diseases cannot be addressed by any one country alone, not even the United States. Citizens for Global Solutions believes that countries can best solve global problems by working together to find global solutions.

We believe that achieving a secure, connected, just and livable world requires effective international law and institutions, as well as a U.S. foreign policy that makes us safer and stronger through cooperation.  

1. A Secure World in which we work together with our friends and allies to tackle global problems that no one nation can solve alone, like terrorism, genocide and failed states.

2. A Connected World in which Americans recognize the link between global issues and local concerns in communities at home.

3. A Just World in which terrorists, human rights abusers and war criminals are held responsible for their crimes and deterred from future attacks.</description>
  <mission>Citizens for Global Solutions envisions a future in which nations work together to abolish war, protect our rights and freedoms, and solve the problems facing humanity that no nation can solve alone.</mission>
