  <description>Ask your parents about when they went out and applied for their permit and their license.  

- How much was insurance? Not 100 dollars a month.
- Drivers Ed? It sure wasn't rising to $700.
- Speeding Ticket? They didn't get their license suspended immediately.
- Driving with friends in the car? It didn't matter to anyone.
- 40 Hours on road with a parent? Never happened!

Why suddenly must all these rules be applied to teenagers, when they never were before? It's not to ensure our safety.  It's to get more money for the state, and to keep kids off the road in general.

Speak out.  You don't need to donate, there's no reason to.  Just let everyone know what you think about it.

1. The majority of teenagers drive responsibly.

2. Most teenagers can not afford drivers ed, insurance bills, and license fees on their own.

3. The laws passed by the Massachusetts State Government are too harsh on teens.</description>
