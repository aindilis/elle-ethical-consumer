It's time we ask Congress to own up to what is going on. We cannot allow them to continue to hide behind death numbers so large, they mean nothing anymore. Each loss of life, is a loss of an individual life. It has the right to be recognized individually. Regardless of whether or not we agree with the war, we need to tell Congress we are paying attention.

Congress must admit to what is going on. Here is one soldier's thoughts:
"I find it ironic that the flags were flown at half-staff for the young men and women who were killed at Virginia Tech yet it is never lowered for the death of a U.S. service member." --Army Sgt. Jim Wilt

The petition has begun. It is time to ask Congress to do the very, very possible. We do not ask for money, we do not ask for impeachment, we do not ask for dissention in the ranks. We ask for acknowledgement of those lives that are being lost.

We ask for the Congress Flag to be lowered to half-staff for one day whenever an American soldier dies at war.

It's time they own what they do.
