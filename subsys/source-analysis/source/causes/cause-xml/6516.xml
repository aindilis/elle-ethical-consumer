  <description>This cause is to protect and save the four great predators in Norway (Wolf, bear, wolverine and lynx/bobcat) from extermination. Today it's only an incredibly small amount of these animals left in Norway, and it's vital for the environment that we save them, instead of shooting them.

Of course this cause also is to help protect and save wildlife all over the world, but especially these four creatures.

The money donated to this cause goes straigthly to World Wildlife Fund (WWF)!

1. A living environment is the founding of a living society

2. Wolf, bear, wolverine and lynx/bobcat all have unique positions in the Norwegian fauna

3. They've got the right to live, and we'll do everything we can to help them do it.</description>
