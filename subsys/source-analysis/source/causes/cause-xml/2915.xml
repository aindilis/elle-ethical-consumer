  <description>Pop tabs delivered to certain Ronald McDonald Houses can be refunded at a considerable profit for the House, and therefore for the families who benefit as a result.

Check out your local Ronald McDonald House local website or by simply placing a phone call and see if they participate in the can tab collection project. 

If they do, then collect tabs! And either do this as a group donation and collection or do it yourself. Then merely drop them off at your local Ronald McDonald House!

This is not something you have to collect money for, so it's easy and fast!

The address for the Central Pennsylvania Chapter (which this site is for) is:

RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE CHARITIES OF CENTRAL PA
745 W Governor Rd
Hershey, PA 17033

1. It's quick and easy.

2. Raises money from an item that would normally go in the trash.</description>
