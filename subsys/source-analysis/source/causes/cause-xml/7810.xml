  <description>At the beginning of the month it is so easy to just spend the money we have, whether it be for a house, a car, or a luxury item we always wanted. 
10 days after our extravegant spending we somehow come down to reality and wish that we never spent it.
It's not fair! We want more! 

1. It's not our fault we like to dress well - Give us more money!

2. It's not our fault we like to party - Give us more money!

3. It's not our fault we like to gamble - Give us more money!</description>
