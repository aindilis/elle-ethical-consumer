  <description>Cindy Sheehan's resignation from her activism is a tragic kairos. She has given up in despair, and we have lost an iconic leader. By starting this cause, we will let the perpetrators of this ongoing crime know that the resistance has not been tamed. Our pacifism can be changed. By believing that activism is a foregone enterprise, and by admitting to the same jaded, beaten, and ultimately flawed, attitude that she has succumbed to, we are damning ourselves. Keep speaking out. We need it more than ever now. 

Take tangible action today. Call your representatives, write editorials, get involved in local government, and  inspire friends. The elections are looming near, and the repercussions of our choices will foretell history to come. 



1. American troops should begin a gradual withdrawal of troops from Iraq immediately. 

2. Let our congressmen and women know that we are adamantly opposed to the Iraq occupation.

3. Mobilize a grassroots protest to show Cindy Sheehan that although her efforts seem worthless, at least she has touched a whole generation of people.

4. Make an impact, in your own way. Vote morally in 2008, and voice your opinions loudly. </description>
