  <description>The National MS Society's vision is: 
A World Free of MS.

The Society's mission is: 
We mobilize people and resources to drive research for a cure and to address the challenges of everyone affected by MS.

The Mid-Atlantic Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a community of individuals who want to achieve a world free of MS. The Chapter is committed to the philosophy of wellness, offering those living with MS the encouragement, materials and skills necessary to achieve and maintain meaningful, productive lifestyles.

Founded in 1955, the Chapter helps over 8,000 individuals in western North Carolina and the state of South Carolina impacted by MS. We provide comprehensive support services and educational programs to people with MS, their family and friends, and raise money to fund cutting edge research into the cause and cure of multiple sclerosis.

1. MS stops people from moving. We exist to make sure it doesn't.

2. We are moving research forward by relentlessly pursuing prevention, treatment and cure.

3. We are moving to reach out and respond to individuals, families and communities living with multiple sclerosis.

4. We are moving politicians and legislation to champion the needs of people with MS through activism, advocacy and influence.

5. We are moving to mobilize the millions of people who want to do something about MS now.</description>
