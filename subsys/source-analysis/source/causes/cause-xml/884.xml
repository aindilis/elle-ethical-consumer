  <description>Sankara Eye Society, Coimbatore was started in India in 1977. This trust had the philanthropic philosophy of providing high quality health care, especially eye care to all, either free or at an affordable cost. In 1998, Sankara Eye Foundation was established to support the work of Sankara Eye Society. Our mission is to eradicate curable blindness by the year 2020.

SEF, USA is a 501 (c)(3) registered non-profit organization and all donations are tax exempt in the USA.

We initiate and drive community eye care activities in India by working with eye care organisations such as Sankara Eye Society, which runs the Sankara Eye Hospital in Coimbatore.

The majority of our fundraising effort is achieved through fundraising events, booths in major events, advertising and working with major donors.

Through these fundraising efforts, SEF, USA has played a significant role in increasing the number of free surgeries eight fold to its current projected annual rate of about 70,000.
	  	
Funds are collected for specific programs such as:
	
&#8226; Open an Eye a Month ($30 per month)
&#8226; Other specialized programs such as corneal transplants.

Funds collected under specific programs are sent in its entirety to India. In addition, SEF, USA provides extensive feedback to its donors &#8211; on how the money is used. This feedback has led to a large number of repeat donors.
