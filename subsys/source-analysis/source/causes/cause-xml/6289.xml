  <description>A few  years ago i was approached by a man named siripala,who began to relate his distressing story.One day siripala was approached by a group of german foreigners who asked him the way to the mount lavinia hotel,confused by thier questions siripala,who was with his 5 year old son,thought they were offering to buy his little boy.In his fear and panic he shot the germans in their gonads and started singing the national anthem,sripala was jailed for 25 years.This dear people is what the mohan lal grero foundation aims to prevent,incidents such as these can easily be avoided if the poor man is provided with a basic english education and is taught that not all german nationals are paedophiles..join me on my quest..in the name of apollo lycius.

1. Teach local musicians like Amaradeva and the Gypsies english,enabling them to  collaborate with great artists such as Michael Jackson and Kevin Federline to produce musical masterpieces like my personal favourite'the macarena' 

2. Educate the women in our country so they will blossom into far greater leaders than the perverted men in our land. 

3. Teach the children how to read so they will not indulge in unwanted extra curricular activities and  become promiscuous girls and boys.</description>
