  <description>Islam is the best practical religeon but its image has been tarnished because of its own followers. 

Islam is a religion that intends to foster the best economic, social and political system across the world, without any discrimination on any bases what so ever, let alone in the muslim world. 

The emphasis is on the word 'economic' because the flawed economic system is the root of all evils. 

To build this economic system, however, better education is a prerequisite. Most of the so called Islamic Fanatics are neglected children of poor families, who do not have free quality education and, therefore, end up in Madrassas.

1. Free quality education for poor

2. Governments should concentrate on the economic growth rather than erradicating the so-called Islamic Fanaticism

3. Every muslim should build their professional skills and be positive</description>
