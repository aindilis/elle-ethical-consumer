  <description>The remote areas of Pakistan, where time seems to have stood still for centuries, are abysses of poverty, unemployment, and illiteracy. Children are born and grow old in squalid surroundings, unable to break loose from their legacy of deprivation and despair.

Developments in Literacy organization (DIL) was launched in February 1997 in Southern California. Its main purpose is to work for the eradication of illiteracy, in the remote and neglected areas of Pakistan, by establishing primary and secondary level non-formal schools for underprivileged children.

DIL, a nonprofit, voluntary organization has succeeded, in a period of five years, at establishing 200 schools for 13,000+ children in collaboration with various NGO&#8217;s. DIL has chapter boards across the United States and is expanding to other parts of the world.

Please join us in our struggle to pave the way for a brighter future for these innocent children living in areas where schools are nonexistent.
