  <description>There are over 70 cats in the care of The Last Chance Cat Ranch.  All are neutered/spayed and fully vaccinated.  Aside from foster homes, the cats live in a cage free environment and have a very large outdoor cat enclosure where they can go in and out the window whenever they want. The LCCR is a registered society in the Province of Alberta.
