  <description>The Stevens Johnson Syndrome Foundation (Julie Foundation for allergic drug reactions) is a non profit organization that operates solely through donations. The purpose of the foundation is to provide the public and medical communities with information on adverse allergic drug reactions. Allergic drug reactions are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Adverse Drug Reactions may cause over 100,000 deaths among hospitalized patients each year. Less than 1% of all drug reactions are reported to the FDA. The public needs to know what to look for when taking any drug and seek medical attention immediately in the event of a reaction in order to prevent permanent damage. The SJS Foundation is also doing medical research into SJS (Stevens Johnson Syndrome)/TEN (Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis).

1. Almost any DRUG can cause SJS/TEN, including over the counter drugs. 

2. SJS &amp; TEN do not discriminate against anyone! Everyone should be aware of allergic drug reactions.</description>
