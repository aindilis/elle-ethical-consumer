  <description>Leopards inhabit some parts of Asia and also Africa. They are beautiful felines who have been hunted for thousands of years for their beautiful fur coats. They are gorgeous wild cats who should not be killed. Unless we act soon, leopards, along with many other cats, face extinction. People have been building over their homes for centuries and food for them is scarce. THerefore, they eat cattle on peoples' farms. They are considered a nuisance to cattle, and are frequently shot or hunted because of this. As this continues to happen, their homes shrink as well, and their population is decreasing each year. It is a shame that such beautiful cats are close to exctinction.

It is important to preserve the animals we have left on the Earth.
