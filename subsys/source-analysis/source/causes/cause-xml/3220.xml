  <description>The idea behind the Ronald McDonald House program is simple: Provide a "home away from home" for families of seriously ill children receiving treatment at nearby hospitals.

Some children must travel great distances to get medical attention. In-hospital treatment may last one day, one year or longer. For these children's families, accommodations can be hard to come by. Options often are limited to costly hotels or uncomfortable hospital chairs and benches.

The Ronald McDonald House provides a comfortable, supportive alternative. It serves as a temporary residence near the medical facility where family members can sleep, eat, relax and find support from other families in similar situations. In return, families are asked to make a donation ranging on average from $5 to $20 per day, but if that isn't possible, their stay is free.
