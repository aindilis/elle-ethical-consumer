  <description>Selective mutism is a social anxiety disorder, in which a person who is normally capable of speech is unable to speak in given situations.  It is usually known as a childrens' disorder but is seen in adults as well (especially if left untreated).
The purpose of this cause is not to raise money, but rather to raise awarness and put aside the common misconceptions related to the dissorder. For example, the cause of selective mutism is not caused by trauma and although scientis once believed the condition only affected 0.1 percent of Americans that number has risen to 0.7 and may be much higher due to the lack of understanding of selective mutism.
Treatments are crucial for those afflicted with selective mutism and has been proven much more effective for children than adults.
