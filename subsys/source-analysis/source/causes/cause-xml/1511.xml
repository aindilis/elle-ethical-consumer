  <description>This is an awareness campaign
which will, i hope, feed people with the 
information needed to stay well away from any 
circumstances which could land you in some serious shit... 

1. Written educational campaigns in poor remote areas is not going to get the mesage accross.

2. Visual campaigns must be started at a huge rate e.g. pictures.

3. These pictures cannot be over explicit, because little children have a chance of being exposed to disturbing images.</description>
