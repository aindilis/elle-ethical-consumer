  <description>Lebanon, isn't a free country. It never was. But lebanese ppl are bored to live with terrorism, wars, deaths and tears. Time has come to erase politicals problems and hold each other hands for peace. If you want a free country, if you want to study, sleep, eat, play, ...live in safety, join my cause..

1. Politicals problems between students must end immediately

2. Political discrimination must end immediately too

3. Like each other without thinking twice..</description>
