  <description>Gangsterism, sexual and physical abuse, tattooing, drugs and loss of hope is destroying the youth of South Africa. Young boys who end up in prison become involved in prison gangs and their lives are destroyed forever.

Hope Academy is a program that aims to bring hope to these young lives through sport. The program teaches team dynamics, life skills and biblical principles as well as offering high quality soccer coaching. Boys that come through the program have an opportunity to go to our academies in the communities, find employment and even play professional if they are good enough. Hope has been born!
