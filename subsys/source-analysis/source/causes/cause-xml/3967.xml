  <description>There is a crucial difference between nearly all genocides and the holocaust. 

The Turks used racism and anti christian sentiment because, as an imperialist power, it was useful for them at that time RE: land grabbing. Just like the British empire fomented racism against blacks to justify slavery. Nazism was INHERENTLY racist. It did not just use it for political convenience, it was a cornerstone of Nazi ideology. 

Also the Holocaust was planned, mechanical and on a huge scale. People being murdered not because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time and with the wrong ethnicity, but JUST because of their ethnicity. 

and we shouldn't forget that 12 million peopl;e died in the holocaust. We shouldn't forget the 5 million socialists, communists, gypsies, slavs, gays, disabled people etc who were slaughtered. The 6 million jewish people.
