  <description>This group is in Memory and Honor of:

&lt;b&gt;Sandee Fusco &lt;/b&gt;
-&lt;i&gt;Never give up and NEVER lose hope. I am always there by heart&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Andrea Garbutt (November 20th, 2003)&lt;/b&gt;
-&lt;i&gt;Even though you lost the battle physically, your spirit never ever gave in.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Kim Gaither&lt;/b&gt;
-&lt;i&gt;Even though I did not get the chance to know you well, I got the blessing to even meet you.&lt;/i&gt;

Breast Cancer Statistics (Via http://breastcancer.org)

-Every three minutes a woman in the United States is diagnosed with breast cancer. In 2006, an estimated 212,920 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed, along with 61,980 new cases of non-invasive breast cancer. And 40,970 women are expected to die in 2006 from this disease

-A woman's risk for developing breast cancer increases if her mother, sister, daughter, or two or more other close relatives, such as cousins, have a history of breast cancer, especially at a young age. However, 85% of women who develop breast cancer have NO known family history of the disease.

&lt;b&gt;If cancer has touched you in some way, please consider a small donation.. I want this group to be well known on facebook and it starts with everyone here. Thank you. (Minimum donation: 5$)&lt;/b&gt;
