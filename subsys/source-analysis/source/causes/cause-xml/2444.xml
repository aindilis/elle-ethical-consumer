  <description>The mission of the PKD Foundation is to promote research to find a cure for PKD and improve the care and treatment of those it affects.  Education and advocacy are important parts of accomplishing that mission. 

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common, life-threatening genetic diseases, effecting 600,000 Americans and 12.5 million people, worldwide. ADPKD affects more people than Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia combined. 

ADPKD causes fluid-filled cysts to grow on the kidneys. Over time, these cysts multiply and grow, in 50 percent of cases, causing kidney failure. Dialysis and transplantation are the only treatments for kidney failure. There is no treatment or cure for PKD.
