---- Alex on Energy 
             "Alternative energy? I live on campus during the school year, and walk to most of my classes. During the summer, I don't drive too often. I don't see any wrong in riding a bike every now and then, and I can't understand why some people must drive Lincoln Navigators and Hummers. Especially the H2, which is like a big metal and plastic shoebox on a pick-up truck frame. It's big, it's ugly, it's wasteful, and it can't even go offroad as well as a little Jeep could. I haven't seen the H3 yet, but at least it's supposed to be smaller.

I don't know if the problem is that we need alternative sources of energy, or that we're so careless with the sources we already have."

1. Alex Neville must be president. 

2. I Craig Modelski should be his campaign manager.

3. There is no one better than Alex Neville. </description>
