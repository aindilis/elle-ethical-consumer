  <description>Philip Paarthipan Coomarasamy developed symptoms of Wegener's Granulomatosis within two weeks and died at the age of 22. The symptoms were aches and swelling in his joints that moved from one area to another, swelling of the lymphatic glands and difficulty breathing. This was a hard diagnosis to come by; my brother went to the ER twice and was seen by numerous doctors before he was admitted to the ICU with respiratory difficulties. Within 24 hrs he began to cough up blood as his lungs were haemorraging.  He was admitted to the ICU on May 19, 2006 and he passed away on May 26, 2006.
