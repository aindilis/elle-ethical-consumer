  <description>Between 700 000 and 4mil people are trafficked each year, mostly into the sex industry. Thousands of 20-something Indian women are drugged, kidnapped and sold to one of India's thousands of brothels. Their lives are stolen from them and they are treated like worthless nothings - being stripped, beaten, cut, bitten, scratched, burned with acid and raped. Some as many as 15 times per day, for as long as 13hours. These women deserve to be helped out of their circumstances - and to be given new hope...
