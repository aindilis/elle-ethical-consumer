  <description>Help the Kiwi fruit is an organization that believes all fruit..and vegetables, deserve the same rights, liberties and priviliges of their peers. For too long has the orange and apple been the main mascots of the Kingdom of the Fruits, while all the poor Kiwi's have been shunned and disregarded as 'unworthy', 'too green', 'hairy' and many more vulgar discriptions too hidious to even mention.

The time has come for us to stand up against such cruelty and help in the struggle for equal fruitality.
Martin Luther King once said that he had a dream...and I belive this dream included the Kiwi. 

So please join the cause for the Kiwi and help them become more popular.


1. All Fruit and Vegetables deserve the same rights

2. All Fruit and Vegetables deserve the same liberties

3. All Fruit and Vegetables deserve the same priviliges

4. Kiwi's should be counted among their peers as equals

5. The Kiwi is man's friend</description>
