  <description>It has been stated in many places in our government that &lt;b&gt;every&lt;/b&gt; U.S. citizen should have equal rights no matter race, religion, color, gender, but not for &lt;b&gt;sexual orientation.&lt;/b&gt; Why? Do they think we're not good enough? I have seen unethical and unfair treatment in many events in U.S. history such as hate crimes, marriage laws, work laws, and many other daily situations. Today, it is said one in ten people are some form of LGTBQ. Thats a lot of people to oppress. Many gay people and there supporters are fed up with this unfair treatment. It is time to put an end to this oppression. Help us support this cause. Thank you to every one who is joining this cause. Maybe soon the government will get the picture that &lt;b&gt;everyone&lt;/b&gt; should be free.
