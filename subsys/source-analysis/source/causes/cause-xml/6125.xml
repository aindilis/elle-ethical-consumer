  <description>the wholesale slaughter of veggies has reached epic proportions! the growing conditions of these poor defenseless living things is beyond horrific! over-crowded, force-fed artficial nutrients to make them grow faster &amp; stronger, sprayed with toxic chemicals to prevent insects &amp; other such natural occurances!

millions of the veggies die each &amp; everyday for the consumption by people. they are alive &amp; deserve our respect &amp; protection!
