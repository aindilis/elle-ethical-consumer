  <description>Many dogs are seen homeless roaming highways and streets. Alot of these dogs are lost and hungry. If the dog is unable to find food or water the dog will eventually die. These dogs are without love and care, they are cold and homeless. Many of these dogs cause accidents while trying to cross busy roads in search of food. They are helpless and in need of love and care.

please donate to help give these homeless dogs a loving and caring family!
