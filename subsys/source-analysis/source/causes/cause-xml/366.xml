"The United States stands to lose or gain more than you have any idea of as a result of your behavior. In the House you will be in contact much of the time with others a good deal younger than yourself&#8212; many of whom have never got a close look at an American before. You will find their ideas about the United States quite startling, acquired as they are through TV or the movies, with the omnipresent tourist thrown in. And, as the first genuine American they have ever had an opportunity to study close up, your behavior and your views and your reactions will probably color their opinion of the United States for many years to come. Whether you like it or not, you are going to represent your country 24 hours a day, under close observation by keen critics. If it is important to you that the British think well of Americans, then you had better act up to your own ideal; if not, then you should have stayed home."
