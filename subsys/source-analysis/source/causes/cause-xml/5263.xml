  <description>Are you an artist, designer, photographer...or are you just plain creative and would like to get exposure? A group of artists and designers whom were members of the Corcoran College of Art + Design are starting an Art + Culture Magazine which would feature articles, spreads, and other spotlights not only on the art scene of DC, but the encompassing art and culture scene around us. We are currently an online magazine, but as this grows we are seeking funding to also publish a printed version later on. If you have any ideas, would like to help, or get involved in any way please email us at Contact@Artcademagazine.com. We would love for our readers to contribute artwork and articles
