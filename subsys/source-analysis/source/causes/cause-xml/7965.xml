  <description>well, me and mike albright have been jame to music for wuite some time. and we have discoverd that playing air instruments insted of actually playing the real thing is easyer than playing the real thing. so we sat down and jamed to about 6 songs. and damn i must say that we are pretty good at it. and ever since then we have been air jaming everyday practising. Then we came to the idea of getting a whole bunch of air bands and having a competition at the warf rat ralley or scallop days. It would be lame but loads of fun. So our mission is to help make the air band cause known. And yes for those of you who are thinkin. Jesus they must have boring life's and do nothing at all. And yes you are exactly right. we dont, we live on an island what do you expect lol. 

1. air drumming is slowly on the rise

2. It is very fun

3. it kills bordem</description>
