  <description>"The Travis Roy Foundation is uniquely positioned to touch individual lives with its focus on providing adaptive equipment and sponsoring research. In the US alone, there are approximately 250,000 people currently living with a spinal cord injury and 13,000 new injuries each year. The Travis Roy Foundation could help many more deserving applicants if funds were available. "(http://travisroyfoundation.org/index.htm)

The Travis Roy Foundation distributes grants to paraplegics and quadriplegics in financial need to enable them to purchase items and technology necessary to live more independent lives. Examples of eligible items include upgrade/maintenance of wheelchairs, grants to assist in van purchases, vehicle modifications (i.e hand controls and lifts), home modifications including ramp and elevator installation, and adaptive equipment. The Foundation also supports research into a eventual cure for spinal cord paralysis and supports the "First Five Project", an innovative high intensity, focused exercise program for motivated spinal cord injured adolescents and adults with quadriplegia. The Travis Roy Foundation is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit, and donations are tax-deductible to a full extent as allowed by law.
