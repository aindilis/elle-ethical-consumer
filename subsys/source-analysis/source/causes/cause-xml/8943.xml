  <description>Many people think that we need to pull our troops out...but let me tell you(liberals) if your not in the military keep your mouth shut, because your opinion shouldn't count anyway.  You (liberals) are not willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, but instead sit on your ass back in America and bitch and moan about everything...If the soldiers want to fight, let them fight, without them you wouldn't be able to protest or complain or any of that bullshit (in most countries thats considered treason punishable by imprisonment or death) so consider yourselves lucky.

1. The United States needs to maintain a force in the middle east so we dont have iraq war 3 in another 15 years.

2. If Iraq wants the troops over there, they can pay for it, give our gov. a break.

3. If you are anti-war....nevermind...your thinking is probably so fucked up that i dont even want to try to change it.

4. All people who want to vote in this country and share all of its freedoms, including protesting and voting, need to serve their country...before they can bitch.</description>
