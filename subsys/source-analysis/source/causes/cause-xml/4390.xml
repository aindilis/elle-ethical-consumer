  <description>The Narwhal is an Arctic whale species. They can grow to 23-26' in length not including the tusk. The tusk is usually associated with males, but females have also been found with tusks. In many cases there are two tusks on males. The tusk can grow up to ten feet in length and is used for piercing the ice under which it lives and also for "tusking" between rival narwhals to win over females. It is also believed that the tusk helps to detect changes in water temperature and composition. This whale is one of two species of white whale in the Monodontidae family (the other is the beluga whale). 

The English name narwhal is based on the Old Norse word n&#225;r, meaning "corpse." This is a reference to the animal's colour. The narwhal is also commonly known as the Moon Whale. 

Very little is known about these majestic whales, the creature that brings childhood fairytales to life. The "unicorn of the sea" is a peaceful and intruiging animal that deserves consideration and protection. 

1. Stop hunting for the narwhal tusk
