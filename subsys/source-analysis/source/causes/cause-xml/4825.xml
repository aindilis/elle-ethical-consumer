  <description>Meat is too good not to eat.  Vegan's don't eat it.  That means more meat for me.  So for every steak a Vegan doesn't eat, I plan to eat 2.. just to eliminate their cause.  And I encourage your support.

FYI.. Don't donate money.  But if for some crazy boneheaded reason you do donate cash, be informed it goes to PETA.  And we don't want that do we?  I had to choose something.  I also tried deleting the cause, but I don't think you can.  So anyways.. Don't donate any cash.  The only way to help this cause is to eat twice as much meat as you normally would in one sitting.  Comprendez?  

1. eat meat

2. applaud a field of healthy cows

3. walk into a butcher shop with an ear to ear grin and an open wallet</description>
