It all started with five tents pitched under a grove of coconut trees. A banner hanging nearby read, "Haiti: Hope in God." The year was 1983 and the tents belonged to George and Jeanne DeTellis, who had left the United States after 25 years in the pastorate to pioneer New Missions in Haiti.  
   
Who could have imagined how God would bless such humble beginnings!  
   
Today, those five tents are a distant memory. Forty three buildings later, New  
Missions has 20 churches, a medical clinic, 20 preschools, 20 elementary schools, a high school, a Bible college, business school, and a Missions Training Center for hosting visiting teams.  
   
Over 6,500 students, representing over 55 villages, are enrolled in New
Missions schools. Approximately 1,000 people are cared for each month through
the medical clinic ministry. New Missions employs over 350 Haitians to teach,
preach, and meet the needs of their own people.
