  <description>The World Youth Alliance is a global coalition of young people committed to promoting the dignity of the person and building solidarity among youth from developed and developing nations. We train young people to work at the regional and international levels to impact policy and culture. Through this lived experience of the dignity of the person young people are able to affirm life at all levels of society.

Founded in 1999, WYA embraces over one million members from more than 100 nationalities. WYA has offices in Nairobi, Manila, Brussels, Mexico City, and New York. 

WYA members experience human dignity through cultural activities, gain a deeper understanding of human dignity through training activities, and are able to advocate for person-centered approach to development through advocacy.
