  <description>The Daniel Is Poor Foundation was founded in 2002 in order to provide Daniel Hernandez with money so he may purchase a wii and other items, which will bring him temporary happiness.

note: thanks to anyone who tries to donate but all this money goes to that "Save the Children" organization because I had to choose a non-profit org. to start a cause. But if you insist...

1. Daniel is better than you at handling money so you should give it to him.

2. Daniel NEEDS a wii, ipod, and ds lite.

3. Daniel being poor makes baby Jesus cry.</description>
