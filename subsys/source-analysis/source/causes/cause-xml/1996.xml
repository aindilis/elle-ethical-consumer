Today their are over a quarter million Armenians living in the country of Georgia. Javakhk is a region in southern Georgia which is part of the historic Armenian homeland. The inhabitants of the region are 90% Armenian, however they live in dire socio-economic conditions with almost no voice within their government.

The region is plagued with rampant unemployment, crumbling infrastructure and fraudulent elections. The Armenian population, in search of a better life and work, has been consistently emigrating from the region. If current trends continue the region, which has been home to Armenians for thousands of years will become void of any remnants of an Armenian identity.
