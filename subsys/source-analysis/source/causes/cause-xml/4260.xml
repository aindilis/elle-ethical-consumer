  <description>Wolves are one of the most noble creatures,  however very few can survive in the wild due to man and the predjudice towards these beautiful animals. I want to educate the world about these majestic creatures.

1. Wolves should be able to roam free.

2. Wolves should not be shot.</description>
  <mission>protect these noble creatures that embody the spirit of freedom and power.</mission>
