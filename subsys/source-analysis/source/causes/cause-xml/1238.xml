  <description>An organization that makes one-of-a-kind songs for terminally ill children, especially those with cancer. All of the songs are written and sang by professional musicians. Each song is individually written about the child's interest, close family and friends, and with the type of that person likes. Songs of Love makes songs in every language, free of cost.

These songs are proven to help make the painful treatment these children grow through easier. Imagine the joy on a child's face, a child who daily gows throw painful treatment in hopes to survive, when he receives his very own song, about him. 

One of the biggest and only fund raisers Songs of Love is going to a school, temple or church, a youth group, or any other organization and record a song. That's right, Songs of Love will go and with as large or small group as posible record a song for these children. Imagine having over 1,000 people (I've heard it done) all contributing to this amazing cause.

I strongly urge all of you to visit http://www.songsoflove.org/ and become involved in Songs of Love.
