  <description>Zak Schmidt, an ardent outdoorsman and car enthusiast, has recently been presented with a rare opportunity. His father, the acclaimed Peter Schmidt, has told him that if he is able to scrape enough money together for a substantial down payment (say 2-3 grand), that he (Peter) will help finance the brand new Jeep Wrangler!

A young man's dream of owning the ultimate off-roading man-mobile is so close, you can almost smell it.

Even the smallest donation will be meaningful. This cause is not asking for too much money, as Zak can get most of it himself.The last remaining thousand or so dollars may prove difficult, but with the assistance of his many dear friends, the goal can be easily met!

Help Zak seize this opportunity, the feeling you will get by helping him out will be one of the most joyous of your young, or old, life!

2. Purchase Jeep Wrangler

3. Endless joy for Zak and his friends.</description>
