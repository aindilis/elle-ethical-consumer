  <description>Online game and virtual world software companies are non-state actors functioning without oversight as a law unto themselves, often promoting "code-as-law". The solution isn't to regulate them with heavy government intervention, but to open them up to more accountability and accessibility to subscribers. 

We need to promote an "avatar bill of rights" that is comparable to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Self-governance should be promoted not only within each virtual world but across platforms, and should not be the exclusive province of virtual world software makers or game manufacturers or only self-appointed scholars and experts.

1. Self-governance of virtual worlds must be democratic, accessible, accountable.

2. Universal human rights should apply in virtual worlds.

3. Virtual worlds can be used to promote real human rights causes.</description>
