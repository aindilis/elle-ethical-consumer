  <description>Zooquatic continues to sell purposefully bred and wild-caught small animals, reptiles, birds, and fish. Please urge Zooquatic to fully commit to ethical business practices and cease their exploitation. Animals should never suffer for someone's pocketbook. Zooquatic has announced that it has broken contract with the Hunte Corp. and will cease puppymill puppy sales.  They will offer puppy adoptions instead. Zooquatic hopes to be the community, privately owned option for those opposed to big-box businesses such as Petsmart. However, the puppy cages are simply being filled with other animals bred for profit.  Say  NO to Zooquatic until they say no to animal exploitation.  The New River Valley shelters have more small animals waiting for homes than they can house.  Please ask Zooquatic to step up and offer small animal adoptions instead of sales.

1. The sale of animals bred for profit is unethical and irresponsible

2. Adopt...NEVER buy.

3. Zooquatic petstore should be boycotted until sales of all animals bred for profit cease</description>
