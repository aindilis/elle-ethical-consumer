  <description>we have witnessed -- and are still witnessing -- the reprehensible results, affecting a wide variety of what are literally life-and-death issues, of a governing philosophy that exudes absolute contempt for the separation of church and Government. The problem with church and government mixing usually means the issues begin to be defined not as fair or just, but as good and evil. Religion has a bad habit of making a black and white argument. Christians, Muslims and Jews see the world as a test and struggle to the souls of humanity for eternal reward to the believers and eternal punishment for the unbelievers. Hence compromise with those outside the group in power usually isn&#8217;t an option as they are not good or as good as the ones with religion. In essence, it is wrong to compromise with evil.


1. Stop electing Religous people in Government

2. Focus on the REAL issues this world faces

3. Stomp out all religions</description>
