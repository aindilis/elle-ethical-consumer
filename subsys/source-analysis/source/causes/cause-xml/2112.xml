  <description>Blink-182 ended with an indefinite hiatus.  This cause is to show Tom, Mark, and Travis how many people want them back together.

1. They're the best band.

2. These guys were closer to each other than brothers.

3. They're God.

4. Since I'm not changing the above one for one user :P, I'll please him by saying that they're muscial genuises.</description>
