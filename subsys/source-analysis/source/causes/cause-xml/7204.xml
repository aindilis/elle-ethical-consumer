  <description>Over 80% of women experience this problem, but for a few of us, it is a serious threat to our health and fertility. Endometriosis is a disease where bits of the endometrial lining don't drain out like they're supposed to and attach to other internal organs. There have even been cases reported of it reaching the brain. THe body can't dispose of it properly so it forms scar tissue around it, causing pain in the area. It can spread through the bloodstream and cause further problems. Major cases cause some women to have surgery or even a hysterectomy. 

1. There must be more attention brought to this disease so that a cure can be found.

2. Women either have a hard time having children or are infertile because of it. Those women deserve to have babies just as much as the others.</description>
