  <description>We're part of an international effort to solve the climate crisis.  

The Alliance for Climate Protection was founded in 2006 by Al Gore, Nobel Laureate and former Vice President of the United States. With more than 2,000,000 members worldwide, the Alliance is a unique non-profit, non-partisan organization that is committed to educating the global community about the urgency of implementing comprehensive solutions to the climate crisis. 

Through its projects &#8212; The Climate Project, Repower America, the WE Campaign, and the Reality Coalition &#8212; and its affiliated organization, The Climate Protection Action Fund, the Alliance seeks to present choices and offer changes that will protect our planet for future generations.

1. The climate crisis is real and the costs of inaction are worse.

2. We need to engage and educate the public on the urgency and solvability of the climate crisis.

3. We can't just change the lightbulbs, we must also change the laws.</description>
