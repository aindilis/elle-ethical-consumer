  <description>The Udjat Foundation is a Kemetic Orthodox charity dedicated to helping children, named after the Eye of God that represents health, wholeness, and protection.

1. I have come from my town, descended from my district,

2. I have done ma'at for its Lord, and satisfied Him with what He loves.

3. I spoke truly, I did right, I spoke and repeated accurately,

4. I seized the proper moment in order to stand well with others.

5. I judged between two people so as to content them both,

6. I rescued the weak from those stronger than them to the best of my ability.

7. I gave bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty, clothes to the naked and a boat to the boatless.

8. I respected the elder, protected the widow, nourished the orphan.

9. I respected my parents and raised their children.</description>
