  <description>The FOUNDATION FOR PEACE is a 501(c)(3) not-for profit organization dedicated to working hand-in-hand with people in need to enable their personal growth and achievement.

The Foundation organizes mission trips for people of all ages to three countries: the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Kenya. 

In the Dominican Republic the Foundation has sponsored children and adults to receive education ranging from elementary to medical schools. 

The Foundation has built churches, medical clinics, infant care centers, orphanages and schools in the Dominican Republic. It hopes to continue the work in Haiti and Kenya.

CURRENT WORK: From July 13-29, 2007, the Foundation for Peace will be taking their first mission trip to Nairobi, Kenya, East Africa. We will be working in partnership with African Enterprise (AE) (http://www.africanenterprise.org) and their Kenya Team Leader, Stephen Mbogo. We tentatively plan to provide a free medical clinic and  do a construction project with an orphanage.
