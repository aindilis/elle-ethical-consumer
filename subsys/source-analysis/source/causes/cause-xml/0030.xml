Our local elections are important, our right to vote in them is sacred, and the decisions we make have a critical impact on the quality of our lives. Unfortunately, people often pay far more attention to politics at the federal level then they do to politics in their own home towns. All too often, voters go into the booth with little or no real information about what is at stake in local races, and they find themselves simply voting party lines, or voting based solely on name recognition. Voter Information Guides address this problem.
