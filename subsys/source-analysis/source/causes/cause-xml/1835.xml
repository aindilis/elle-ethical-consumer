  <description>This cause is to promote an all inclusive learning environment, free from scrutiny and discrimination, by advocating equal rights and protections for all students regardless of sexual orientation.

1. All students should be protected under the law - regardless of sexual orientation.

2. Policies should provide provisions that explicitly state students are NOT to be discriminated based on sexual orientation.

3. Practices and policies will both protect and ensure the equal treatment of all students, regardless of sexual orientation.</description>
