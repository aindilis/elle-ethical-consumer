  <description>Hi, My name's Anya Furst and I am training to participate in a half-marathon as a member of The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training.

All of us on Team In Training are raising funds to help stop leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and Myeloma from taking more lives. I'm completing this event in honor of all individuals who are battling blood cancers. 

Please make a donation to support my participation in Team In Training and help advance the Society's mission.
