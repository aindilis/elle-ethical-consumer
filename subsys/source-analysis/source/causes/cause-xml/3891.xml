  <description>I decided that I wanted to make a difference in the lives of all animals, I was working at a very nice, very organized SPCA in the Woodlands and thought, they don't need me here, they have everything in order, I am of no help here, so that is when I decided to venture off into the scary unknown of Houston, Texas' 610 loop! Yes ladies and gentlemen, if you don't already know about 610 let me tell you something, it is a very dangerous place to be, and guess what..BARC is located right inside of the 610 loop. This place deals with the different counties in and outside of Houston TEXAS. Unlike the SPCA, BARC deals with more troubled animals, more internal cases, cases dealing with demending kids, strange adults with nothing better to do then abuse animals. YOU CAN HELP BY contributing anything, toys, food, money, your heart and soul, ANYTHING to help these animals find the proper home, I haven't given up on them, and neither should you! REMEMBER YOU CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE, IF NOT YOU THEN WHO?

1. We are the generation that must stop animal abuse!

2. The answer is not to just put animals to sleep!

3. We, can do something, YOU can make a difference</description>
