  <description>I am doing a bike ride at the end of September to support the MS society. I am looking to raise as much money as I can. The money goes to research, medical help, and many other things to help people with MS. Any small donation will help. I appreciate this you guys.  When you guys donate, donate at www.wavestowine.org and try to epledge me or send me a message with questions. Thanks.
