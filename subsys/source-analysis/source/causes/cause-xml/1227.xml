  <description>Our mission is to provide humanitarian aid in the form of shelter, warmth, and comfort to people displaced by natural and other disasters.

The traditional focus of relief organizations is on immediate needs.  Local and international relief organizations react with initial aid of food, medicine and short-term shelter to relieve suffering and hardship; however, the need for shelter goes on - often for months.   

Our solution to disasters is the ShelterBox &#8211; a tough, green plastic box containing a 10-person tent and ancillary equipment designed to enable a family of up to 10 people survive for at least six months. 

Specially designed and using high quality materials, our tents are suitable for a wide range of conditions.  ShelterBox works directly with local organizations in countries where disasters have occurred, in partnership with other aid agencies, and through the international Rotary network. Our volunteer teams often oversee the distribution of boxes to individual recipients, making sure aid gets directly to those people who need it most.

ShelterBox USA located in Lakewood Ranch, FL is the national affiliate of charity ShelterBox Trust, headquartered in Cornwall, England. ShelterBox has responded to more than 100 disasters in over 60 countries.
