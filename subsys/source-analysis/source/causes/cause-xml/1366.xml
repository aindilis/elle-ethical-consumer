  <description>The Houston SPCA is a private, nonprofit charity which receives no funding from the government, United Way, or any national animal groups.
The HSPCA receives over 40,000 animals each year &#8212; an average of more than 100 animals per day. The majority are lost, homeless, or simply unwanted. While many people think that the Houston SPCA shelters only dogs and cats, in reality, small mammals like guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, ferrets and rabbits, as well as horses, cows, goats, pigs and other livestock-type animals also find care and shelter at the Houston SPCA.

The mission of the HSPCA is to promote respect for all animals and free them from suffering and abuse.

As an open-door animal shelter, the Houston SPCA accepts all animals in need. No animal is turned away due to species, size, or health. The doors of the Houston SPCA are open to all animals: domestic, livestock, exotic and wild.

Last year, the Houston SPCA received:

9,767 dogs
7,889 puppies
8,427 cats
10,497 kittens
655 rabbits, hamsters, ferrets, gerbils and other small domestic companion animals
191 livestock animals
1,643 wildlife animals
