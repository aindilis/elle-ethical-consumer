  <description>A team of 6 individuals from NE Ohio will be traveling to Uganda the first week of July to meet and partner with different relief organizations and missions ministries. These organizations operate to bring restoration and hope to the people of Uganda in the midst of Rebel Warfare and the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time: the AIDS epidemic.

The team is partnering with Christian Life Ministries, Compassion International, Sports Friends International,   and The Invisible Children.

Please pray for the efforts of this project and the lives of the people of Uganda so that hope, love, and peace can be restored.

If you can financially help this cause, we would greatly appreciate it.  Finances will go to project expenses, toys for children, sports equipment for clinics, and orphan facilities. 

Please send check, or money orders to:
Uganda Missions Team
c/o First Christian Church
6900 Market Ave N
Canton, OH 44721

please mark "Uganda Team" on the Memo Line.
