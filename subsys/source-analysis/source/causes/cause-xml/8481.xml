  <description>Today ( July 22) My car was broken into. The crow barred my window open and when that didn't work the just broke through it. All they took was my purse(hey i was at a park for less than an hour). Nothing too valuable was taken but now i have no license, no health insurance card, no concert ticket, no purse, and no window! So I'm hoping someone could find it in them to help donate to my fixing window/new purse fund :(((((( This totally sucks... and anything helps :((((((
I love you guys
