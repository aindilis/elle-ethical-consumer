  <description>In some countries a journalist can be thrown in prison for years for a single offending word or photo. Jailing or killing a journalist removes a vital witness to events and threatens the right of us all to be informed. Reporters Without Borders has fought for press freedom on a daily basis since it was founded in 1985.

1. Defend journalists and media assistants imprisoned or persecuted for doing their job and exposes the mistreatment and torture of them in many countries.

2. Fight against censorship and laws that undermine press freedom.

3. Work to improve the safety of journalists, especially those reporting in war zones.</description>
