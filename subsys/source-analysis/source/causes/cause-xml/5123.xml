  <description>Approximately 1 in 10 pregnancies end in miscarriage.  It is very traumatic for the family.  All that happiness and hope turns into disappointment and loss.  This cause will donate any money received to supporting families who have lost babies, and it will hopefully also act as a forum for us to support each other.
