  <description>We are all people and should all be treated the same and have this same rights despite our race, sex, religion, and/or but not limited to, sexual orientation. We need information on any rallies/protests, educational programs, or anything to help stop the prejudice. Get all of your friends to join. We can put an end to the hate.

2. Teachers need to speak up and act when they witness an act of prejudice.</description>
