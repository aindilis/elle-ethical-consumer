  <description>While sayings like 'punk died in the 80's', or an emo faggot saying 'im hardcore punk'  threaten our very exsistance, the upcomming election promises good things. IF HILARY CLINTON IS ELECTED, PUNK WILL RETURN!!! nobody wants her, nobody likes her. so why not elect her president and watch the people revolt.


this doesnt mean i like government. thanks michael
