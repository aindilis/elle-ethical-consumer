  <description>Hunting is the oldest sport on the earth.  These days we do not have to hunt to survive but we do have to hunt to help preserve the enviroment and the animals in it. Not to mention the thrill we get from stalking and shooting something.

1. Continue the hunting tradition.

2. To tell people about our amazing sport. 

3. To swap hunting stories and learn the best ways to get our game.</description>
