  <description>Israel is a nation surrounded by enemies. Israel's citizens must live under the fear of a suicide bomber blowing themselves up on a bus or market or school. Innocent civilians are being targeted by Arab agressors. Israel has had to adopt a very agressive defense system whose tactics are constantly being protested in America while no one even considers protesting against the Palestinians for their part in the conflict. Israel has a right to defend herself by fighting fire with fire, whatever is nessecary to protect her well-being.

1. Israel has been a victim of thousands of suicide bombings and has the right to try to prevent them.

2. Terminating enemy leaders is a  nessecary evil in Israel's case, and its actions of the kind should be considered justifiable.

3. The American public does not have a firm understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</description>
