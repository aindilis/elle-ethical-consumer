  <description>Imagine yourself as the sponsor of Danelyn, a little girl in North Korea.  You got a picture of her on your desk, beside the picture of your family.  During the past year, you've traded letters with her three times, and your know from the letters that she loves to read and frequency gets annoyed by her little brother.  She is excited that next year she will get to play on the soccer team.

The foundation of Plan is in its child sponsorship, with almost 1.39 million currently enrolled. 

I have experienced the feeling of anxiously ripping open the envelope to read the very first letter you receive from your special child.  Moreover, I have experienced the feeling of writing a letter and searching for the "just right" words that fully capture the happiness and joy that you feel to see her grow and develop.

There is simply nothing like it!
