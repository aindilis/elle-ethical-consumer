  <description>Though many are unaware that slavery still exists, the kind of slavery that exists today is just as destructive and powerful as the slave trade that was legally abolished 200 years ago. Children are forced into manual labor for little or no money, women and girls are forced into working as sex slaves and are brutally victimized without hope of rescue, and men are trapped in debt bondage by falsified documents and careful manipulation. To protect innocent people from the blight of slavery, Free the Slaves aims to spread awareness, confront governments that tacitly allow slavery, and rescue slaves, giving them the chance to tell the world their stories.
