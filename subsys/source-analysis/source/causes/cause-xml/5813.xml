  <description>This cause can get people clued in on how bad it really is when people participate in what they think is pure sport such as bull fights.  If you've ever seen some of the bull fights it shows how the participants stick needles in its skin, set the bulls horns on fire, tease it, throw stuff at it, and it goes to show little people care and respect an animals rights and freedom. 

1. No bull is to be used for mans own pleasure

2. Bulls are animals and do have feelings

3. Take a step in the Bulls position and see their side of the fun</description>
