  <description>The point's of my cause are to bring this genereation of musician's together and to give alot of good examples of what music's all about to our children.
So if your a musician or in a band or if you just wanna talk music then add me and join the cause. 

1. Music is expressional art

2. Expressional art teach's tolerence of race and religion.

3. A world without racism is a world war free.</description>
