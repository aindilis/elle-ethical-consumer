  <description>Iran is being attacked by the US in order to destroy the Islamic Republic for its outcry of Palestinian and Lebanese injustice by Israel.  Iran is abiding to all UN regulations for peaceful nuclear energy, yet the US continues to attack and persecute.  Iran refuses to remain silent and allow the Zionist war machine (Israel) to continue their Arab genocide. This cause is primarily to spread the word of what is really happening in the middle east!

1. Iran must be allowed peaceful nuclear energy

2. The US must end their persecution of the Islamic Republic

3. Iran has every right to defend themselves in the face of US aggression</description>
