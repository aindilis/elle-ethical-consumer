  <description>are world is a currupt place! us humans make it this way but we as humans can also stop this by doing little things to help. a big one of these problems is the sweatshop labour all over the world. major companys should not be allowed into poor countrys and have the people work there in bad work conditions and being paid only a DOLLAR for a days work!! even kids work in these huge factories all day long to try and support their family. could you imagine going to work in a foctory at this age and only getting a dollar to support your family with after a 17 hour day. we must let the companies know that what they are doing is wrong. these companies are:
Nike,
Wal-Mart,
Walt Disney,
Gap,
New Balence, 
these are just some some of the companies that do these awful things to humans. so we as people must be the voice for those who cant talk for them selves! join me in the fight to end sweat shop labour

1. we need to tell the companies we know what they are doing and that it is wrong

2. freedom is a right that all people should have no matter there statis

3. we must make people in our own country aware about what is going on</description>
