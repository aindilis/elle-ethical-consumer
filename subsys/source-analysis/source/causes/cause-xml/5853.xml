  <description>I've got a registered sex offender living down the block from me.  He molested a 16 year old girl.  That's not much older than I am.  Honestly, it scares the shit out of me. The government should pass a law stating that registered sex offenders are not allowed to live in residential areas.  

1. A law must be passed stating that registered sex offenders should not be allowed to live in residential areas. 

2. Protection of the general public must be concidered when passing this law.</description>
