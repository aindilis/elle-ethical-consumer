  <description>War zones are all over the world. Looking back before they were there. These unscathed lands were used for agricultural uses, and spaces for human cultivation. Now, thousands live in have demolished homes, with gunfire ripping through every day. This is bigger than just the reduction of war zones, but the saftey and protection of those caught in the crossfire. The land should be used for its prime purpose, not to absorb blood, or hold mines and shards of metal, but to build settlements, food and a vision of a better world.  

1. The amount of Warzones tearing many lands apart. 

2. Unexploded Mines are killing more and more people every year. With over 500, 000, 000 mines and shells unexploded. 

3. Pollutants from War materials are killing many people that are accesible to the water being polluted. </description>
