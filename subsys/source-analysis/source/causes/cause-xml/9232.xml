  <description>We are a Madison, Wisconsin-based non-profit dedicated to eradicating brain tumors. In 2007 we reached our initial fund raising goal, allowing us to establish Wisconsin's first-ever Brain Tumor Professorship at the University of Wisconsin Carbone Comprehensive Cancer Center. We're not stopping here - the more money we raise, the more resources our top researchers have!

We also hold an annual event at Blue Mound State Park, with hikes, bike rides, kids' activities, yummy food, a health fair, and more! Check our website for details, www.headrushevent.org.

Thanks!
