  <description>For more than 80 years in Dane County, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has been building hope for those who are in need.

We quietly touch the lives of thousands each month at our Service Center, which operates the busiest and most resourceful food pantry in our area and provides a wide range of charitable assistance including prescription, furniture, clothing and utility help to Dane County neighbors in need. 

At any one time over fifty men, women and children reside in housing operated in Madison by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. We operate Port St. Vincent de Paul (a home for men) and St Elizabeth Ann Seton House (transitional housing for women and children).

Above all, St. Vincent de Paul is about direct, person-to-person aid to people of all ages, races and religions. 

We help our neighbors in need.
