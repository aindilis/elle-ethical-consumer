  <description>The soldiers of the Israeli Army fight every day for our safety. All they want is the best for us, and the generations that will follow. Not only do they have to leave their loved ones, such as friends and family behind, but they must also live in uncomfortable and dangerous conditions. They sacrifice their lives for us everyday. The least we can do is show them that we care. &lt;br&gt;
Not only would we like to ensure the safe return of these brave and heroic people to their homes, but that their families will have an easy time. Not all people are as fortunate as us and can afford items that are essential to living a healthy life. They are struggling enough with the thought that their loved one might not return home. Help today- support the Israeli Army. 

Thank you all so much for supporting the Israeli army and our cause! We strongly appreciate it! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

1. We believe in the Israeli Army.

2. The families of the Israeli soldiers deserve all the support they can get.</description>
