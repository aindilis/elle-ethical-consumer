  <description>Imagine, black walls giving way to breath taking cathedral ceilings, accented by blue aura light fixtures. Imagine, a half moon bar with a built in ice feature to keep drinks cool, staffed by some of the prettiest people this side of the River. Imagine, today's hottest mixes being spun by Rochester's hottest DJs.  Imagine, the sleek &amp; edgy style of NYC combined with the sexed up trendiness of L.A.  

Imagine....Club Zoom!
