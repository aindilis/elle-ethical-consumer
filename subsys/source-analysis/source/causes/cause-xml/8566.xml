  <description>"HS variably presents clinically with painful and chronically recurring, deep-seated follicular nodules, papules, pustules and abscesses, leading to suppuration, fibrosis, distortion, degradation and hypertrophic scarring of the skin. The etiology/pathogenesis/cause of HS is not known. HS remains a distinct and separate disease. In the past, direct comparisons of HS to sweat gland and acne diseases have delayed the planning and development of focused HS research which could discover the actual cause."
