  <description>In every City Animal Shelter, Every week 20-30 dogs are killed and cremated due to lack of room in the kennels. So many highly adoptable dogs "rotate" through these kennels and the only thing that can save them is YOU! So even if you cant have a dog, there are lots of ways you can help:

1. Volunteer! Boost morale and take pictures of dogs needing homes, fighting against the clock. Spread the word and find homes!
2. Keep your own dogs safe by putting tags on them with current information and phone numbers! If your dog goes missing, check the shelter daily! Neuter and spay your pets: this will keep puppies from being born into a world that just cant commit and take care of them. 
3. If you find a stray animal, check its tags, make phone calls, put up signs, post a "found ad" on craigslist.com or other sites. Finally, take the animal to a "no-kill" organization, NOT an animal shelter.

If you believe that dogs deserve to be safe, loved and ALIVE, then THIS is a cause for you!

Support the Humane society with your donations. Save dogs with your time and energy!
