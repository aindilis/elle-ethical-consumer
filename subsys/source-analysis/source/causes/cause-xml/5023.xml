  <description>Global warning is not a major factor in our lives. what we do or how we live will not change the fact that an ice age is coming. Al Gore is in the election race and many people know this because of his movie An Inconvenient Truth, which is a very well crafted bit of propaganda (bs). i am not asking everyone to idle their cars but to look at both sides of the argument and make your own choice.

2. No matter what we do an ice age is coming</description>
