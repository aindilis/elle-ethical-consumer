  <description>This fall, I am running the San Francisco Nike Women's Marathon with The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society's Team in Training. 

While I pursue this endurance challenge, I have to raise funds for the cure of Leukemia and Hodgkins' Leukemia. Not only is this marathon a fitness challenge for me, but it is also a race that I will run in honor of a role model, Corey Kelly, whom I lost to Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2003. He was only 32 years old.

You can learn more about my efforts and make a donation by visiting my Web site:

The donation amount can be as little as $20. After all, every little bit counts. I just need all the help I can get.
