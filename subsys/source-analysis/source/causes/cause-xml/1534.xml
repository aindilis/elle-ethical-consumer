  <description>The U.S. government has so far not done it's job in protecting the environment, It has acted only as a subsidiary of the big Oil and energy Corporations, along with most of the other environment-harming large corporations, all the while Global warming is on the rise and already hurting our coastal areas and farming lands. The EPA and the U.S. government should stop blocking proper Caping or laws to curb Co2 emissions and Global warming and pollution, and DO THERE JOB.
