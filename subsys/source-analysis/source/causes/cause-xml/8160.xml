  <description>I hope to educated parents in our community, about the lack of guidance and protection our children recieve at school.  We as parents seem to believe that our children are being left in a safe environment.  It is more common than you know, that our children are being bullied by other children as well as teachers and staff in their schools.  Please become involved with you childs school and hopefully we can make a difference.  The more parents who see what is going on can help by contact the appropriate people to stop this and get administrations to realize this is a big problem, and to ask for more stringent policies regarding bullies, and bullying in our childrens school.  Contact you MP if need be.  Something has to be done.
