  <description>If animals shouldn't be eaten, why are they made of meat?

Prehistoric man ate meat, raw meat. Why shouldn't we? Meat is the natural food for well being.

MEAT EATERS, UNITE!!!

1. Meat is part of a healthy, natural diet.

2. If you don't eat meat, you'll die a terrible death. Of scurvy perhaps. Or gonhorrea.

3. Think of all the starving children who wish they could have meat, but can't.</description>
