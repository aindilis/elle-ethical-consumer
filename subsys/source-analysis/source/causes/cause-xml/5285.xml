  <description>Horse slaughter is a major issue in todays society and the closing of the horse slaughter houses has done nothing but HURT the horse industry.  Prices will fall and an over-abundant horse population will soon be on the rise.  Horses aren't people, they are a way of life and how many people make a living!.  We need to do something about this!! 

Key Facts

 Horse processing is the most tightly regulated of any animal slaughter, and the only animal that has its transportation to slaughter regulated. If horse processing plants are forced to close, the Horse Welfare Coalition estimates the 60,000 to 90,000 unwanted horses annually would be exposed to potential abandonment and neglect.

 The 60,000-90,000 additional unwanted horses each year would compete for adoption with the 32,000 wild horses that U.S. taxpayers are already paying $40 million to shelter and feed.

 The nation&#8217;s inadequate, overburdened, and unregulated horse rescue/ adoption facilities can not handle the influx of the 60,000+ additional horses each year that would result from a slaughter ban, according to the Congressional Research Service.

 Many zoo animal diets rely on equine protein because it mimics what the animal would receive in the wild. Veterinarians and animal nutritionists say it's the healthiest diet for these big cats and rare birds. If legislation shuts down horse processing facilities, the only USDA-inspected source for this meat will be eliminated.
