  <description>To everyone who wants to live in peace and joy, sometimes we shed our clothing or drown our sorrows to do so. We despise hatred and prejudice and blinding jelousy!!!!! Despise it! An in spite of our conservative self-made suicide-society-surroundings, we push through. We'll never rest this battle against the evil spirits! We recognise that all life is temporary and we live it to the full. Save what's permanent, your only heart and soul.

Sometimes we get together, calling all cultures together to celebrate in joy. We live consistently and with utter indulgence in music, arts, theatre and pure enjoyment of life.

1. Live fully and experience true Joy

2. Share Love

3. Nobody needs to be judged, the world will be much greater without it</description>
