  <description>In the same way Republicans organize voters in churches across the country every Sunday, progressives need to make room for organizing young people through music communities if we want to be effective.

This cause is dedicated to making this vision a reality.

2. Cultural organizing is the best way to reach young people and incorporate politcal action into everyday life.

3. Concerts are fun!</description>
