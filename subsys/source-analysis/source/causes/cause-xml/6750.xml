  <description>Mormon Missionaries fill the earth and spread the gospel in truth and righteousness. They share gospel truths to everyone to accept or reject its message. 

The intent of this cause is to strengthen missionaries by opening your hearts to those that knock on your doors. Allow them to enter into your home. Let them share their message with you. Question them. Test them. They want to answer your questions. They want to be asked questions. 

If you desire to help the missionaries in this regard please join and help share the news. No money is required as a donation. 

The best gift you can give another is your most authentic self. 

1. Mormon Missionaries need to share the gospel. 

2. Soften your heart and open your mind. 

3. Find answers to your questions and soothe your soul. </description>
