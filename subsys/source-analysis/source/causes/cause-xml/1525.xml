  <description>With Andrew McMahon of Something Corporate and Jack's Mannequin being diagnosed with Acute Lymphatic Leukemia, 11:11 A.M. was created.

Through the help of musicians and bands, 11:11 A.M. raises money for Cancer Research. Selling over 10,000 bracelets and thousands of buttons so far, 11:11 A.M. was able to raise over $14,000 already.

Throughout the two years of being a charity, 11:11 A.M. has established a great team: Adam DeAngelis, Angela Lucier, Melissa Pereda, Kathleen McNally, Rhiannon Zielinkski, and Leah Blowes,

Some of our supporters include: Jack's Mannequin, Something Corporate, Fall Out Boy, The Academy Is..., Dear Jack Foundation, Airport Tapes and Records, Your Music America, Motion City Soundtrack, The Spill Canvas, Plain White T's, and many more.

We have been on the entirety of both Warped Tour 2007 and 2008.  We have a benefit concert every year now and will most likely expand that!

Additionally, we signed a clothing contract with Glamour Kills and they are selling our t shirts on www.glamourkills.com!
