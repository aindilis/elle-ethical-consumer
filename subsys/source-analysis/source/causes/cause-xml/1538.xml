  <description>Village Volunteers was founded in the belief that partnership is a key factor in the renewal and healing of areas plagued by poverty and disease. Committed to preserving autonomy and cultural heritage, Village Volunteers works in collaboration with village programs to support the achievement of their goals and objectives by integrating international volunteerism, sustainable community development projects, and program assistance.

Through collaboration based on friendship and the commitment to human rights, volunteers have the opportunity to strengthen ties across the boundaries of international borders, race, gender, age, and culture. Village Volunteers is dedicated to preparing volunteers to be culturally sensitive and educated about the goals and objectives of each community, inspiring a sense of global citizenship.
