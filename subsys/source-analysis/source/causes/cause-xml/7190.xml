  <description>Im sick and tired of not being able to take my beautiful dogs out for a nice walk or jog, having to mussle them where ever they go ... all these stipulations that another breed of aggressive dogs dont have to follow. I have 2 pitbulls they are the biggest sucks, my mothers shitzus are more dangerous! This bann needs to be deleted. The main cause of dog bites isnt the dogs fault ... its the owners... if babies were running around biting people .. would they bann having kids ???? NO .. ban the deed  of the owner neglecting his property!! not the BREED....thanks you for listening.
