  <description>Still growing, VancouverFire is a ministry constantly reinventing its ways of communicating to Christian high school students, encouraging each and every one of them to pray for their peers individually at school, and start a fellowship in their very own mission field.

The Vancouverfire leadership team serves as a liaison between churches and school clubs in Vancouver, as well as between the local events of Vancouver, and Canadafire. Vancouverfire also produces several local events in the year, for school fellowships and ministry partners to converge in dialogue. Events we regularly support are Campusfire, and Onelife.
