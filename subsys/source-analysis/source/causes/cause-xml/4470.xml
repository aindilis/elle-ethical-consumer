  <description>Divyang Mago is probably among the top 30 billion people to have ever lived. Therefore, we are trying to get the United States to recognize his birthday as a national holiday. We'll call it D Day. Clever, no?

1. Divyang is never to be questioned.

2. Divyang's beliefs are your beliefs.

3. You must provide Divyang with a gift on his birthday.</description>
