  <description>Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was unlettered. He could neither read nor write, and he grew up in Makkah where there were no schools. He was far away from the scientific circles that existed in Syria, Alexandria, Athens or Rome. Moreover, the scientific facts mentioned in the Qur'an were not known in that age, i.e., the Seventh Century CE. 

Having studied and examined the Arabic text of the Qur'an, Dr. Bucaille marvels: "I could not find a single error in the Qur'an. I had to stop and ask myself: if a man was the author of the Qur'an, how could he have written facts in the Seventh Century CE that today are shown to be in keeping with modern scientific knowledge? 

Forgive him who wrongs you; join him who cuts you off; do well to him who does evil to you; and speak the truth even if it be against yourself. - Prophet Muhammad (salAllahu alayhi wasalam)...
