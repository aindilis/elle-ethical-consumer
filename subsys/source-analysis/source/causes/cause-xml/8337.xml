  <description>My name is William Sheldrick - and as you can see by my pictures i was born with a defect in my face and body. I have Just one hand and even thats small and shrivelled (much like Jeremy Beadle who used to be on game for a laugh) Im sure that the majority of people out in Facebook land and beyond could afford perhaps &#163;1-2 so that a disfigured child (at heart) could once again smile out of his wrongly placed mouth.
Remember &#163;1 buys you a sleepful night knowing that you have helped a flid-kid.
I thank you.

1. Disfigurement is NOT nice

2. Having no laptop is NOT nice

3. Being Disfigure and Having no Laptop is even more not nice</description>
