  <description>This is for people who feel the BAN on Hunting with Dogs is unjust, misinformed and wrong.
Tony Blair's Labour government stopped hunting with dogs in February 2005.
This cause is designed to illustrate the voice that Fox Hunters really have, and to provide an online presence to raise awareness for the cause.


1. Fox Hunting must resume immediately in the UK.

2. The ban must be revoked.

3. Anti-Fox Hunters must understand the true values of Fox Hunting.</description>
