  <description>Vision: To establish a successful national organization to support lung cancer patients and their families and to provide an avenue for sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ.

This organization was established in memory of my dad, who lost his 27 month battle with lung cancer.  We started this because lung cancer is a very underfunded disease, in terms of research.  There is a stigma associated with the disease that smoking is always involved...that is simply not true.  There are many people with lung cancer that have never smoked. 

The foundation is currently collecting donations, as well as new and used DVDs.  We have purchased portable DVD players for some local chemo rooms, so patients and their families can watch a movie during the long treatment times.  Any donations recieved will go towards the purchase of DVDs, DVD players, or patient scholarships (to help pay for the various expenses associated with cancer treatment).
