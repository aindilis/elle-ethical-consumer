  <description>Of all of the candidates running for office in 2008, Barack Obama is the candidate with the clearest vision, most credible  voting record and most charismatic personality. Barack Obama is the perfect candidate to not only lead this nation in a critical moment  of its history, but the perfect ambassador to lead the world in the crucial moments of the present. 

&#8220;When we send our young men and women into harm's way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they're going, to care for their families while they're gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never, ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.&#8221;
