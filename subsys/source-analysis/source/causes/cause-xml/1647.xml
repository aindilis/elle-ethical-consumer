  <description>We are an anarchist collective located in Seattle.

We have several working groups, including Anarchist Education, Food Not Bombs, and Community Gardening.

We are also a distro, and spend a lot of time helping to educate the people on the street about a large number of issues. 

These issues include: 
*What anarchism really stands for, and how it has worked in practice.
*The failures of capitalism.
*The war in Iraq.
*Military recruiting.
*Global warming.
*Peak oil.
*Civil liberties.

We don't believe that any of this will change with any politicians. Both democrats and republicans are the parties of big business. So we also take direct action. Our web site has a lot more information on it, check out the the literature section:

A great introduction to anarchism:
