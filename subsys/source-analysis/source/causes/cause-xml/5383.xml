  <description>Do one nice for some one else each day. Like help the elderly lady with her groceries. Offer to help the neighbor walk his dogs. Doing things like this could send ripples that last for days. Like mowing your neighbors yard could allow him to spend more time with his kids, that he wouldn't normally have. Or helping the little girl down the street fix her bike. Or putting up a fence for the neighbor's dog so he doesn't bark all the time and run to the end of his leash. Anything you can do to make a positive difference in the world is something done. Yes, I understand that people must help themselves to deserve it, we all know that sometimes when we are down, and we don't get any help, it doesn't feel any better. I'm not saying spend money, I'm saying be active with the community. Oh, the cause that is choosen for this does many things for communities, so if you do donate, it will go to them in a general sense, and if you want to donate to a specific thing, go to their website.

1. Helping those in need.

2. Trying to make the world feel better.

3. Help heal the problems that plague our society.</description>
