  <description>Girlfriends and boyfriends will come and go. We ar all going to cry, get are hearts broken and feel like we mean nothing. But we don't. We mean the world, to ourselves. Im not going to tell you that you will find that "special someone", because to be honest. You might not have one.

People will say things that they might mean, but words fade. I know, and iv hurt, but guess what? I love who i am, and no one, no man or boy will ever change that about me. For everyone who has broken my heart, and promised me forever. Thank you for helping me ralize that forever is alot to say to someone. 

Now, for all you guys and girls out there. LIVE! LAUGH! and LOVE! yourself, because if your beautiful, Everyone can see you.

1. You can only trust your love.

2. Self esteem must rise.

3. I care about you, and i bealive in you.</description>
