  <description>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterized by bones that break easily. OI is highly variable. Its signs and symptoms range from mild to severe. In addition to fractures, people with OI sometimes have muscle weakness, joint laxity, scoliosis, Dentinogenesis Imperfecta (DI) and hearing loss. A classification system dividing OI into several types is commonly used to help describe how severely a person is affected. Type I osteogenesis imperfecta is the mildest form of OI. It is also the most common form of OI. It is believed that 50-60 percent of people with OI have Type I OI.
Type I OI can have the characteristics of a &#8220;invisible disorder.&#8221; Often it is not apparent to the casual observer.

We are trying to raise awareness of OI and also trying to raise money to find a cure. So PLEASE send this cause to all of your friends and spread the word.
