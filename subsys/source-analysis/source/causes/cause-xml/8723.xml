  <description>We all know that our world isn't perfect.
But do you really know what is going on 
in other countries? I am here to try help
others. Helping others isn't always with
money, there are other ways. Visit the 
site www.amnestyusa.org where you will
find various cases around the world that 
may be helped by i simple petition to 
sign or maybe even an e-mail to help 
persuade others to do good. If you are 
one of those people who think that
"we have enough problems in our 
country, why should we help theres"
WAKE UP! Do you have the right 
to protest? I mean protest about anything?
Because if you have the right to say what
you want wear you want, can you imagine
being without that? Can you imagine being 
thrown in jail to rot for 6 years without any kind of trail? What if that was you, would you want someone 
to help? I would. So please join me at Amnesty International and see how you can make a  difference. If some of you have troubles with finding a way to help please contact me at this e-mail address : nocturnalvisions89@yahoo.com
