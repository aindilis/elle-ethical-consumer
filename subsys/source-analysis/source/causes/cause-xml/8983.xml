  <description>There are so many people out there who need help to fight an Eating Disorder, the problem is, not a lot of money goes into helping them. A lot of people don't see it as a major problem and so donations are limited. Insurance companies refuse to help pay with some people and so therefore they are left on their own. They need help: They need to be given the chance to change: They deserve to live.

1. Eating Disorders are a true illness

2. Insurance companies can't keep these people from getting help</description>
