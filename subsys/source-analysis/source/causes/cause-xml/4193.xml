  <description>CRH, formerly known as Cincinnati Therapuetic Riding and Horsemanship, is Cincinnati Riding for the Handicapped. They help children and adults with mental and physcial disabilites ride horses.  It is an experience that aides in muscle relaxation and definition, and teaches the kids that they are capable of anything they put their minds to. I have personally witnessed the progress of children who, at first, were too terrified or too dibilitated to even stand next to a horse who were then  riding and controling the reins in a few weeks. The looks on these children&#180;s faces are enough to make anyone passionate about this place. It is an amazing place that changes the lives of those with mental and physical disabilities. 
This amazing place runs on donations and volunteer efforts. They always welcome new volunteers with open arms. Please consider donating money and volunteering your time to this amazing place.
