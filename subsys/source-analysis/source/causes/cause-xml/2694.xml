  <description>Connor Perkins was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when he was just a few weeks old.  He has spent much time in the hospital, and must endure rounds of therapy, medications, nebulizer treatments, and enzhymes each day. Our goal is to collect money to purchase a physio therapy vest for Connor when he is 3 years old worth 10,000.00. This will allow him to attend camp or have a sleep over at Grandma&#8217;s house just like any normal healthy child!
