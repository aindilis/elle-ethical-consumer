  <description>Cedarhill Animal Sanctuary takes in animals that have been rescued from the exotic animal trade, as well as domestic animals.  We have 12 tigers, 5 lions, 4 cougars, 2 bobcats, and 1 wolf.  We also provide care to over 200 domestic cats (including 53 Hurricane Katrina cats), 30 dogs, 5 pigs, 6 horses, 2 parrots, and a squirrel.  Our exotic animals are victims of the exotic animal trade, which is the third biggest illicit moneymaker in the US after guns and drugs.  All of our exotic animals have been rescued from horrendous conditions, either from people who wanted them as a pets or from roadside zoos.  See our website, www.cedrhill.org, for stories about what our big cats have been through.  The exotic animal trade must be stopped.  The animals in the trade are used for entertainment/exploitation, hunting, and animal research.  The most respected zoos in the country participate in the indiscriminate buying and selling of these animals, and show no concern for their lifetime welfare.  Cedarhill is one of the few places that these beautiful animals can live in peace, and receive the lifetime care they deserve.

1. Stop the exotic animal trade.

2. Wild animals are not pets.

3. Zoos need to provide lifetime care.</description>
