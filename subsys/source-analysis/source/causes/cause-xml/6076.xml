  <description>Paula Schomerus was a guest student at Burke High school during the 2006-2007 school year.  She was a great part of the Burke community, and was lots of fun, but on June 25, 2007, she went back to Germany.  This cause was organized to &lt;u&gt; Bring Paula Back!&lt;/u&gt;

1. Paula is great, and Germany shouldn't hog her.

2. Paula has an awesome accent.

3. If need be, Amanda and Ben will fly a helicopter to Germany to get Paula.</description>
