  <description>The National Association of Railroad Passengers (NARP) is the largest national membership advocacy organization for intercity train and rail transit passengers. We have worked since 1967 to expand the quality and quantity of passenger rail in the U.S. Our mission is to work towards a modern, customer-focused national passenger train network that provides a travel choice Americans want. Our work is supported by over 20,000 individual members.

1. Urge Congress to boost funding for Amtrak and rail infrastructure to make trains faster and more frequent, reliable and affordable

2. Ensure that the new investment in rail infrastructure is used wisely

3. Work with Amtrak to make service as good as it can be</description>
