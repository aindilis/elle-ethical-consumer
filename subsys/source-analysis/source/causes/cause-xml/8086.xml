  <description>The American Tradition Foundation seeks to return to a time when citizens and politicians alike adhered to traditional American values. The foundation will openly support any political candidate who it believes embodies the true sense of Americanism, and supports the values and freedoms that our nation was built upon.

1. Less government is better government.

2. Individual liberty is the most fundamental freedom available to mankind.

3. America was founded on values of family and morality, and under these banners our country should be run.</description>
