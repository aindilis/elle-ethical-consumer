  <description>Project Baobab provides free education and entrepreneurial grants to youth, especially women, through a specialized curriculum in Kenya, a country of 40% unemployment with 58% of the people living below a $2 a day. Students complete 100 hours of training in Life Skills and 100 hours in Entrepreneurship.

Upon graduation, our students compete for $100 grants to fund their business idea.  Each woman is assigned a mentor, who follows up with her every 3-6 months to provide business support and encouragement.

We are currently operating in ten high schools, six communities, and the largest women's prison in Kenya.  Since 2001, Project Baobab has educated 800 students and funded approximately 350 new business ventures. 



1. These women/youth will become a source of strength for their families and communities.</description>
