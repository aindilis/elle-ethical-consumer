  <description>Enlarged prostate is a debilitating disease.  It can lead to symptoms of urinary hesitancy, frequent urination, increased risk of urinary tract infections and urinary retention.  It must be stopped before one more old man must suffer its effects.



1. A normal-sized prostate is a universal right of all men

2. Avodart is proven effective in shrinking the prostate, symptom improvement, and lower the chance for prostate surgery.
