  <description> The Bucknell University Conservatives Club is a non-partisan student organization dedicated to promoting the free exchange of ideas in an environment where meaningful debate and ideological diversity are often lacking. We, its members, seek to serve the Bucknell community by infusing it with the ingredients necessary for a balanced educational experience. These ingredients include conservative, libertarian, and classical liberal thought. We aim to find and describe logical solutions to issues big and small, while adhering to the Constitution of the United States and all its amendments. We believe that peace is best achieved through strength, that utopia is nowhere, and that true equality is blind to race, creed, sex, and sexuality. We take it as our mission to expose the inadequacies of the leftist ideas that dominate this University and to articulate an alternative viewpoint. We strive to inform, engage, and perhaps even amuse our fellow students in doing so.
