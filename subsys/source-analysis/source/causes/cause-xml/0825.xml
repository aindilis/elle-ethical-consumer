  <description> Co-chaired by veteran Africa foreign policy and human rights experts Gayle Smith and John Prendergast, &lt;a href="http://www.enoughproject.org/"&gt;ENOUGH&lt;/a&gt; strengthens the growing movement of activists and advocates by providing regular field-based research and policy analysis and forging strategic partnerships with grassroots organizations dedicated to these issues.  To frame its policy prescriptions, ENOUGH developed a &#8220;3P&#8221; approach: promoting peace, protecting civilians, and punishing perpetrators. ENOUGH also focuses on a fourth &#8220;P&#8221;, prevention, and develops policy ideas to build the capacity of the United States government and of the international community to respond to and prevent atrocities. Initially, &lt;a href="http://www.enoughproject.org/"&gt;ENOUGH&lt;/a&gt; is focusing on multiple conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa, including Sudan (Darfur and southern Sudan), the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Uganda and Somalia.
