  <description>The description of LIBERTY is as follows: "To live one's life free of goverment interference". Now though, it's not just the goverment. Every bored housewife tired of their little life wants to try to save our planet with their own little cause. It could be smoking, abortion, or clown porn.  People, please,  let other people live life the way they want to. I prefer advocacy of personal responsibility - We MUST be allowed to choose the way way want to live our own lives !
