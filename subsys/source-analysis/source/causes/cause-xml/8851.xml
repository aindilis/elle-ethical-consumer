  <description>One religion has been taking the world's mind hostage for centuries. It has been ruling over the people, attempting to subvert understanding of the world and make people believe in a book of fairy tales.

John 2:18
Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.

Christian's have treated us as ignorant, foolish and evil people for too long. The Anti-Christ's of the world must stand up against our persecution, for it is their majority persecuting us, not the other way around. It won't be true no matter how much they tell themselves.
