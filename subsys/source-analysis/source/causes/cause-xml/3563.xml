  <description>It hurts when im at the bus stop and ill see someone I know that&#8217;s like in the tenth grade or anybody period that I know, drive by. Your support and donations will help relieve this pain by assisting me in my purchase of a vehicle. This vehicle will help me in so many as ways as I won&#8217;t be late for work anymore and won&#8217;t miss out on the opportunity to chill with my female friends because I have no where to take them and no way to get them. Thank you for your support. And please support generously cause insurance is high and im not trying to push a hoopty, ya dig.
