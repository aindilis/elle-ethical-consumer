  <description>During his time with the Beatles and after their break-up, George Harrison wrote some of the most beautiful music the world has ever heard.  It was through this music that he tried to spread spiritual awareness and tolerance for others (i.e. the Concert for Bangladesh).  After his death in 2001, all of his friends and family got together to share his music and their stories of George in the Concert for George.  We should continue in his footsteps and share his music with others.  In 1973, George established the Material World Charitable Foundation "...to encourage the exploration of alternative and diverse forms of artistic expression, life views and philosophies as well as a way to support established charities and people with special needs." If you would like to donate or find out more about George or the Material World Charitable Foundation, please go to http://www.georgeharrison.com
