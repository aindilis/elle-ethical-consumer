  <description>No employee should be forced to work in a hazardous environment that could put their health or well-being at risk.

There is so much corruption - from the doctors to the store to the union. who is looking out for the regular person? The government here keeps talking about all of the amazing number of jobs available, but they never talk about the working conditions...or the wages.

Most employers don't do the basic essentials - such as providing safe workplaces for their employees. It is the law. People worked really hard to get those worker's rights - in some cases striking for years. Well, what they won't give you - you got to demand. People need to organize themselves (into unions or not) and ensure their human rights are being respected. Did you know that it is a human right to have a safe workplace, and to be provided the equipment and safety gear to make an unsafe workplace safe? It is in the UN convention of human rights!

1. Safe working conditions are a right!

2. To provide essentials to make an unsafe workplace a safe workplace.</description>
