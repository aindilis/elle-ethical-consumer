  <description>Ronald Reagan once said that "government is not the solution to our problems, government is the problem."

The US Constitution was designed to maintain personal and individual liberty for every human being, yet in the twentieth century up to today, politicians have increased the size and the scope of government, which has in turn decreased personal and individual liberty.  Increased taxes have hurt families and the threat to second ammendment rights and free speech rights constantly arise.

The Libertarian Party realizes that decreasing the size and scope of the government considerably is what we must do right now.

1. Reduce the size and scope of the federal government

2. Eliminate many restrictions on the freedom of speech

3. Eliminate the many restrictions on the right to bear arms

4. We support freedom of religion

5. We support property rights and an END to eminent domain

6. We oppose the draft or any form of coerced national service program

7. We believe that the government should operate on a "pay as you go" basis, and not incur debt.

8. We support an end to corporate welfare

9. We support a free and competitive market

10. Low taxes</description>
