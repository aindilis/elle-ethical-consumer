  <description>Many forms of art litter the public area, whether it be bizarre and schizophrenic metal sculptures to "abstract" paintings in which the artist randomly splattered paint on canvas.

1. Abstract, post-modernist and modernist art are terrible and is little more than intellectual masturbation by a non-intellectual pseudo-elite.

2. Forms of art such as realism, impressionism, expressionism et al. are obviously superior to the above-mentioned forms of "art".

3. Inferior forms of art deserve little respect and their artists, little recognition.</description>
