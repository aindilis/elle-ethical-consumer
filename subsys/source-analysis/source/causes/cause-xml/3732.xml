  <description>We want to save up money to get Rosie O' Donnell a liposuction, and then give her fat to starving children in Africa. With enough money, we can both provide the funds to get her a liposuction, and to transport her fat to Africa. We will then package it and release it from planes for the natives to cook and eat.

1. Rosie O' Donnell must stop blocking the suns rays from hitting New York City.

2. The starvation in Africa must come to an end.</description>
