  <description>The Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE) has the purpose of reversing the social decay that threatens our societies by resolving the worst problems that plague man today &#8212; drugs, crime, illiteracy and immorality. This is done by supporting, promoting and coordinating the programs of four organizations dedicated to social betterment &#8212; Narconon International, Criminon International, Applied Scholastics International and The Way to Happiness Foundation International.

While each of the above four activities (Narconon, Criminon, Applied Scholastics and The Way to Happiness Foundation) are non-profit organizations in their own right and each have their own goals and missions, ABLE is the umbrella organization that serves as a coordinating body, provides guidance, support and promotion and ensures that these programs are known, made available and reach entire communities and populations thereby improving the lives of people they serve.

ABLE is a secular (non-religious), non-profit corporate entity with its international headquarters in Los Angeles and offices on each continent.
