  <description>We are not saying that immigrants should take over the U.S. We are not saying that immigrants shouldn't become American. And we are not saying that we want immigrant criminals to receive citizenship rights.

What we ARE saying is that each and every productive immigrant in the U.S. plays an essential role in our country's economy, society, and culture. We ask only for what is fair for those immigrants who contribute to the U.S. system with their money and their work: a FAIR and SPEEDY legalization process!

Join to give this cause a united and LOUD voice!

Some facts to mull over:

- Individuals who have been in the United States for more than 183 days of the tax year are likely to be classified as residents for tax purposes.

- The Social Security Administration estimates that 75% of undocumented workers pay income taxes through payroll deductions. But workers never apply for tax benefits out of fear of being caught and deported. 

- A study by Alan Greenspan reported that there is a $300 billion surplus in the social security system due to immigrants not claiming their benefits after paying taxes.

If immigrants pay taxes, aren't they entitled to certain rights?


1. The current immigration system is ineffective and unfair to all immigrants and the United States.

2. Legalization should be made available to all eligible illegal and legal immigrants.

3. All immigrants contribute to the U.S. and deserve the opportunity to legally reside here.</description>
