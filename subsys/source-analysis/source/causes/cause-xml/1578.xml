  <description>The United States Campaign for Burma is a U.S.-based membership organization dedicated to empowering grassroots activists around the world to bring about an end to the military dictatorship in Burma. Through public education, leadership development initiatives, conferences, and advocacy campaigns at local, national and international levels, USCB works to empower Americans and Burmese dissidents-in-exile to promote freedom, democracy, and human rights in Burma and raise awareness about the egregious human rights violations committed by Burma&#8217;s military regime.


1. The UN Security Council should demand tri-partite dialogue in Burma.

2. Tri-partite dialogue would involve three parties - the National League for Democracy, ethnic reistance groups, and the military (State Peace and Development Council).

3. All 1200 political prisoners should be released.

4. Attacks in Eastern Burma, which have destroyed 3000+ villages already, should stop.</description>
