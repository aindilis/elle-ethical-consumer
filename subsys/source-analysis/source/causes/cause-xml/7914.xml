  <description>This cause is to show that people that who have mental illness(es) are not a danger to society.  The stigma that is there needs to be erased because we are like ordinary, everyday citizens.  The majority of people who have mental illness can function and be in society.  Only a small percentage of people who have mental illness must be institutionalized due to the fact they cannot function on their own. This group is for anyone to join.  You do NOT have to have a mental illness to be a member.  Please, help join the fight to stop stigma that is created with mental illness.  Together, we CAN make a difference.

1. Mental illness should not have a stigma attached to it.

2. We are people who are ordinary people like everyone else but has a chemical imblance in our brains.

3. Mental illness is treatable.  </description>
