  <description>       This cause was created to support the Relay for Life foundation.
       Relay for Life is a non-profit organization that donates money that is used to research cures for cancers.  I have experienced the dramatic effects cancer can have on a family.  Both of my grandmothers passed away in their late fifties, just 81 days apart.  My family was devastated.  My Mom and Dad both contributed by becoming captains of a team in my county that raises thousands of dollars a year to the Relay for Life.
       Do your part by donating as much money as you feel led to.  All donations will be forwarded to the Relay for Life organization. Thank you.
