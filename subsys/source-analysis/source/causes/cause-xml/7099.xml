Indie Roots is taking a national tour of DC indie bands to spread the message: none of us have a vote in Congress! We shall rock to spread the word that the tax-paying, military-serving, law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia deserve to cast a vote for their legislators. Some call it taxation without representation. We call it a 200-year-old crisis of human rights, right in the capital of the United States.

Currently, we're recording and soliciting some tracks for a compilation album of DC artists to help spread the word of DC's plight.  If you want to sign up, let us know!

1. Washington, DC requires the right for full representation in Congress, as guaranteed by the Constitution.

2. There are many acceptible plans currently in the works.  See our website for more!</description>
