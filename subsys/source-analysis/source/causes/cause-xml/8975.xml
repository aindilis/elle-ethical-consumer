  <description>GLBT people are still systematically oppressed by society and that needs to change. Until there is equal marriage and equal rights under the law we have a serious problem. Hate crimes and Hate groups are on the rise in this country and it is utterly unacceptable. GLBT and affiliated organizations need support to help pass legislation and create a safer world for everyone including GLBT poeple. Further than equal rights under the law, "gay" issues need to be taken seriously like AIDS (which was denied as a public health problem for years before and after Stonewall).

1. Gay rights are human rights.

2. GLBT people should be treated with respect NO MORE VIOLENCE

3. Equal rights under the law.</description>
