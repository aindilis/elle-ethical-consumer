  <description>The Purpose of New Community Church's Celebrate Recovery is to provide a loving non-judgemental, accepting place for people to come with their hurts, habits, and hang-ups. We share our experiences, strengths, and hopes with one another, and God's healing power in our lives. By applying the 8 recovery principles and the 12 Steps and thier Biblical comparisons we become free from our addictive, compulsive, and dysfunctional behaviors, and instead have peace, serenity and joy that comes from a personal relationship with our higher power-Jesus Christ.
