  <description>Hello, 

We joined Team in Training, the world&#8217;s largest endurance training program to help us prepare for our first goal: running the 42.2 km of the Nike Women&#8217;s marathon in San Francisco that will take place on October 21st 2007. Our second goal, the MOST important one, is to raise a total amount of 11 000$ for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of Canada and, without your financial help, we will not be able to reach that goal. 

In Gregory&#8217;s name and in the name of thousands of children and adults that are still battling with this disease, we sincerely thank you for your generosity and we invite you to donate online through our website: http://www.active.com/donate/tntvan/tintinetmilou or send your donations by mail at 750 Davaar, Outremont, Quebec H2V 3B2. All cheques should be made payable to The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society of Canada.

We can&#8217;t do it without you, thanks for your support! Melissa Proph&#232;te and Myl&#232;ne Augustin
