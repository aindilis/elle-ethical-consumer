  <description>BRING BACK THE- oh description, right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, as you all may know, dodos went extinct a few centuries ago; however, there is something else that you do NOT know, something that NOBODY else knows. My ancestor, a noble Englishman, kept a dodo egg and hid it in Antarctica, where it froze, and has been kept preserved for centuries now. I discovered this egg on my last expedition, but I do not have the technology required to breathe life into it.

This is where YOU come in. With your help, by which I mean buttloads of money, I can hire a team of scientists (mostly genetics and cryogenics experts) to figure out a way to un-freeze the egg without damaging it and bring the Dodo back from the dark shadowy graveyard of extinction! I've consulted some experts, and it'll cost about $17 million to have this done, so I'll be accepting donations no smaller than $1700. Thank you! MAY THE DODO LIVE AGAIN!

1. Dodos are cool and need to come back

2. I've never even seen a dodo

3. What the hell is a dodo</description>
