  <description>Some seniors from a high school community in Storrs, CT were in English when one day they came up with a plan to DO SOMETHING....

On June 9th, 2007, we had a big awareness fair to support ending all genocide. This was held at E.O.Smith High School, Storrs, CT. All money went towards organizations dedicated to achieving peace in Darfur. Rather than having the event outside as we had planned, we had to move everything inside of the school, but still...    
JUST AS A HIGH SCHOOL COMMUNITY, WE RAISED OVER $15,000 IN ONE DAY.

THANKS TO EVERYONE!! 

Also, as a follow-up, our high school has created a "club" based on wanting to end genocide. We adopted the name and now call ourselves EGAW. As EGAW, we plan to spread awareness wherever we go, such as the former seniors who are now spreading EGAW throughout their campuses. 

To learn more about EGAW, or to find out how you can have EGAW on your campus, in your high school, or in your community, feel free to leave questions on this page. 

Darfur is an ongoing genocide. It is just an example of all genocide. We must NOT leave it to heal itself. IT NEVER WILL.  

1. Achieve an understanding of what happens in the rest of the world.

2. Teach and inform others of what is going on.

3. By the awareness, get monetary support for these places.</description>
