  <description>My name is Julie Olson.  My friend Sarah Gale asked me to come on board with her to start a fund raiser for Invisible Children; I accepted, and now we are heading full tilt into this project; it's going great so far!  Our goal is to raise $40,000 in one year to send to Northern Uganda.  We have a variety of events planned for the year to come, and we need people with time to volunteer, the ability to spread the word, and/or money to donate.  Discover the unseen; Think Globally, Act Locally.

1. Freedom and Peace 

2. Proper Health Care and Education</description>
  <mission>Our mission is to raise money and awareness to aid the war-affected children of Northern Uganda.</mission>
