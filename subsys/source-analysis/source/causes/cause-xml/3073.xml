  <description>There are 400,000 Jewish students in North American Colleges. They are facing tremendous pressure to abandon Judaism from intense anti-semitism, anti-Israel propoganda &amp; social pressure. Sponsor a trained &amp; passionate Jewish Ambassador on campus.

The OU Alumni Services And Programs (A.S.A.P.) serves over 32,000 students (8% of all Jews in college) on campus having graduated from our JSU, NCSY, IPA or currently in our JLIC programs. We can enable these students to be ambassadors for Judaism on campus and create a grass roots movement to win the war against our next generation being fought under our noses right this very moment. $18 provides the materials needed to activate one ambassador this coming year. $18,000 can create an army on one campus. $100,000 can create a movement sweeping all colleges in North America. Help me create this movement one ambassador at a time! DONATE $18 TODAY!
