  <description>Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease.  There is no known cause or cure for this disease.  It occurs when T lymphocytes attack the myelin sheath in the brain and often spine.  Symptoms are fatigue, numbness in face and limbs, and it can cause paralysis.  There are three types that all have different severities.  It is more than two times likely to occur in women and is found in Midwest and northern climates, such as the northern part of the US and Europe.  
Stem Cell research could help in the cure for Multiple Sclerosis.
