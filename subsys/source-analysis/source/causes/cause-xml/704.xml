  <description>If you care about our dwindling natural resources... deforestation... clean water... moving our country beyond oil dependence... healthy oceans... toxins in our communities and our food... global warming... or even just the pollution in your hometown... then this is the cause for you. 

Join up with one of the most powerful environmental action groups in the country-- the National Resouces Defense Council. They've got the people and the pockets to do the things in Washington, D.C. that one individual cannot. They can make your money make a difference for our planet.

1. We must live in harmony with the Earth and its delicate ecosystems.

2. We must find alternate ways to support our energy needs. 

3. We must work inside our country and out to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. </description>
  <mission>To support environmental action groups-- because together, we have a stronger voice. And more money. :) </mission>
