  <description>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a motor neuron disease. The motor neurons affect the voluntary muscles that are used for activities such as crawling, walking, head and neck control, and swallowing. It is a relatively common "rare disorder": approximately 1 in 6000 babies born are affected, and about 1 in 40 people are genetic carriers. 

For a more in-depth description, and more information about this disease, please follow the link below to the Families of Spinal Muscular Atrophy webpage that describes the disease.

This group was created in support of my cousin Jordan, who has SMA. She is such a fighter, and so sweet and happy, despite her disability.  She is an inspiration to us all.

1. Those who can help should.

2. Money should not be a burden for families living with serious diseases.

3. Hope, friendship and support are sometimes the most important things.</description>
