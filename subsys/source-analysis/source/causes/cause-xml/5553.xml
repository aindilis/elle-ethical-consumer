  <description>The Coalition for Freedom is a large federation whose duty is to fight against all forms of inequality, oppression, and injustice in the world. 

1. People of all races, religions, genders, sexual orientations, backgrounds, and disabilities should have equal rights and freedoms in society.

2. Healthcare, food, shelter, and suffrage must be universal.

3. Our world must become a classless and economically equal society based on love instead of violence. </description>
