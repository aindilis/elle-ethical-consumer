  <description>No Wars! PEACE between the Strait. There is no need for war and let Taiwan be in Peace.

This aint about politics within Taiwan. Its about Love for one another as human beings.

This is way beyond "Green" and "Blue", this is for our next generation!

Please do not get confused that this cause is for any political reasons or use. This cause is none of that crap!! All this cause cares about is how we can promote the country and let the world know more about Taiwan, its people, its culture and its land. 

Given that we seek popularity for Taiwan, thus theres no otherway faster than Facebook to speed the promotion! So go out there and INVITE ppl to fall in love with Taiwan!!

United we shall stand! Peace and Respect.
