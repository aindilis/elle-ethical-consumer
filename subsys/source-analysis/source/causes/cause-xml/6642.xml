  <description>This cause exists for all Americans who feel betrayed by their representatives. It does NOT exist for Bush-haters, Bush-lovers, blind Republicans, or blind Democrats. It exists to ask a very serious question, what are the important issues? and should we allow two and only two views of the world? We say no, and argue that there can be more than one view, and that the current US government is an oligarchy, with two similar groups, rubbing each others backs and shifting to the middle in order to get elected. We say its cheap, dishonest, and truly unAmerican. For those who feel they might not agree, but reasonable discussion wins the day, for those sick of Republicans and Democrats, for those who feel we're not playing a football game, we're deciding the course of our nation's history: Welcome. 

1. Against Politics focusing on attacking candidates' background.

2. Against spending millions of dollars on campaigns to get elected.

3. Against homogenizing America and forcing Americans to chose a side--red or blue.</description>
