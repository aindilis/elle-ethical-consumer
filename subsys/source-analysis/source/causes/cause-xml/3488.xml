  <description>This piece of legislation will make it illegal to import, export, and sell in the United States ANY product that was made in a sweatshop.  The definition of a sweatshop is laid out within the legislation.  This law, if passed, would be revolutionary for the labor movement and for laborers throughout the world.  It has as its major backer the National Labor Committee, and I hope you will join in supporting this legislation as well!!
