  <description>This cause was made in order to make people aware of what is going on today. Too many people and children are going on for days starving, living with life threatening illnesses, and not enough is being done about it. Not enough time and money is being taken in order to eliminate poverty and help these people. Everyone is taking things for granted when these poor &amp; helpless people are suffering everyday of their lives. We are the ones who can help these people and make the right changes here. Not many people in this world have the money to support their families, to provide them with everyday neccessities that WE ALL take for granted. It is up to US to make a difference in these peoples lives. Think about what you have; and compare it to many others who arn't as fortunate as you. Get up and do something with your time; join in, and make a difference.
