  <description>Regardless of sexuality, class, religion or ethnicity, we all stand behind one cause: the fight to uplift the ban on same-sex marriage in the United States and (ideally) abroad. We want gay marriage to be a reality and feel it is critical for everyone to have the opportunity to live their lives with their preferred partners in real, loving relationships. Also, we feel it is important for same-sex couples to be able to adopt children, helping to find loving parents for unfortunate children while simultaneously  fostering a hate-free next generation. 

1. Gay marriage

2. Adoption policy
