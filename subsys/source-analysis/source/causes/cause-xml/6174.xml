  <description>A mastectomy is when a woman's  breast is removed in order to remove cancerous breast cells/tissue. If  you know anyone who has had a mastectomy, you may know that there is a lot of pain afterwards.   Insurance companies are trying to make mastectomies an
outpatient procedure. Let's give women the chance to recover properly in the hospital for 2 days after surgery.
There's a bill called the Breast Cancer Patient Protection Act which will require insurance companies to cover a minimum 48-hour hospital stay for patients undergoing a mastectomy.   It's about eliminating the 'drive-through mastectomy' where women are forced to go home just afew hours after surgery, against the wishes of their doctor, still groggy from anesthesia and sometimes with drainage tubes still attached.

Lifetime Television has put this bill on their Web page with a petition drive to show your support.   Last year over half the House signed on. PLEASE!! Sign the petition by clicking on the Web site below. You need not give more than your name and zip code number!
