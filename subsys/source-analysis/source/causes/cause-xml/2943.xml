  <description>I've had this same graphics card since around '98 or something and I think its time for an upgrade.  I always knew that I was in need of an updated graphics card, but when iTunes' "Cover Flow" said it was unable to browse albums on my computer I realized that my computer had officially been outdone by a cell phone (the new iPhone has "Cover Flow").

I just checked;  ATI Rage IIC's (my graphics card) were built Windows 95 compatible.


If you actually want to donate to me getting a new graphics card, don't donate to the organization I put. I only put that because I needed to put one and the title seemed somewhat appropriate.  If you really feel like donating money for me to buy a new graphics card then just give it to me in person.

1. Jordan needs to get a better graphics card.

2. Playing Halo on a computer is a universal right.

3. My lack of good graphics video game playing must end immediately.</description>
