  <description>we aim to free our fellow lebanese who are held in the syrian jails Just because they are lebanese who opposed the Syrian system or maybe didnt even do anything but got disliked by some syrian officer during the Black era of 1990-2005.

They are being Tortured, Hit and some even killed in those jails with no one ever hearing about them.

A Salute to the brave mothers who has been waiting for tenth of years...

Botros khawand and the rest of our heroes in syria, We Salute you!

1. All Lebanese Should be Freed from the syrian jails.

2. All Lebanese who helped their arrest should be held responsible.

3. The Freed Prisonners must be considered As National heroes and treated by the government to overcome the pain of the jail</description>
