  <description>Pop (or beer) tabs delivered to the Ronald McDonald House of Central Ohio can be refunded at a considerable profit for the House, and therefore for the families who benefit as a result. 

As such, rather than raising money for this cause, I'm merely requesting that you save your tabs from the various beverages you might consume every week, hold onto them, and somehow get them to me at your convenience.

(Or if you'd like, you can take them to the Ronald McDonald House yourself. Whatever you want. I'm happy to deliver them on your behalf.)

The address is as follows:

Ronald Mcdonald House ofCentral Ohio
555 Childrens Dr W.  
Columbus, Ohio 43205

So in sum:

&gt; Drink out of cans rather than bottles
&gt; When you're done, rip off the tab
&gt; Keep track of how many tabs you collect 
&gt; I am NOT asking you to donate money (though you can certainly do so--I'm sure the House would appreciate that). I'm merely asking you to donate pop tabs. Easy enough.

1. Everybody drinks out of cans

2. Everybody likes supporting the Ronald McDonald House

3. This is the easiest fund-raiser of all time</description>
