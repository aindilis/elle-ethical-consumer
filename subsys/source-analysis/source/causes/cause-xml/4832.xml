  <description>People everywhere abuse horses.  Habitat for Horses (HfH) is a place where abused horses go.  After HfH receives a horse they do everything in there power to make it well again.  But to make a horse well after it has been abused takes time and money.  Before a horse is ready to be adopted it has thousands of dollars in it.  Not to mention lots of time trying to get the horse to trust humans again.  If you can give a donation that&#8217;s great,  or go to the website and learn more about volunteering and just what Habitat for Horses dose.
