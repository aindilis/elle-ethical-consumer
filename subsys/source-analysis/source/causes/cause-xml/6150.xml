  <description>It is time to stop playing nice, and start offending!!! No more preaching softly-it's time to get agressive! Jesus was the biggest church offender of his time. He went right into the churches and told them that they were WRONG! Stop begging your friends to go to your youth group just because you want someone there with you. They don't need to someone to be nice to them, what they need is a huge slap in the face of REALITY! Life is very unexpectant. Your time can be up at any second! So you need to stop worrying about the things of this world, and get a hold of this -- If you think that you are going to Heaven just for being nice to people, THINK AGAIN! Everything you do, needs to be done through Him. He breathed his life into you because He loves you. Friends don't let friends go to hell! That may seem abrasive, but we don't have time to sugar-coat anything when it comes to this. Stop what you're doing and TAKE ACTION!

1. No one will walk in darkness because Jesus loves EVERYONE!</description>
