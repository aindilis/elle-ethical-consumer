One Brick is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that brings volunteers together to support other local non-profits by adopting an innovative twist to the volunteer experience: we create a friendly and social atmosphere around volunteering, and after each volunteer event -- which typically lasts only 3 to 4 hours -- we invite volunteers to gather at a local restaurant or caf&#233; where they can get to know one another in a relaxed social setting. 
 
One Brick's 'commitment-free volunteering' allows you to choose when you volunteer, rather than having to make commitments for a certain number of volunteer hours, or agree to be available every week at a specific time.
