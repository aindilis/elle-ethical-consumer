  <description>250 years of irreplaceable records survived Katrina, despite being stored below ground.  They are still stored below ground.  The New Orleans Public Library Foundation is committed to safeguarding them while continuing to make them available to researchers.  But it cannot do so without substantial aid.  

For the official site of the New Orleans Public Library Foundation, please visit http://www.nutrias.org/~nopl/foundation/noplfoundationappeal.htm

Please be aware that your donation through facebook will benefit the New Orleans Public Library System as a whole.  To earmark a donation for the archives, you must make it directly through the New Orleans Public Library Foundation site and then send a separate email the Foundation (nopfound@gno.lib.la.us) specifying your wishes.

In addition to giving money directly, you can raise funds for the library by donating your used (but saleable) books to the Better World Books/New Orleans Public Library campaign.  They have raised almost $50,000 for the library through these used book donations.  For instructions on how to donate your books to benefit the library, please visit
