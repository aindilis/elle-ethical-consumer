  <description>We want to provide food and clothing for underpriviledged kids. It is sad to see children around the world dying and starving and cold. I feel so fortunate to have food and shelter. Please help support these unfortunate children so they can lead happier and healthier lives. So many children die each year to this fast growing way of life. Read more about it on the official website of this group ( http://www.end-poverty-now.piczo.com )

1. Children deserve better.

2. No one should suffer like that.</description>
