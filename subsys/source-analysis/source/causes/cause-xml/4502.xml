  <description>Schools, youth groups, churches, and college campuses are all getting involved to help bring freedom and justice to people who don't have a voice.  Love 146, Free the Slaves, IJM, Makeway Partners and Compassion Int'l  are the organizations LC2LC supports in our fight to end slavery.
IF YOU WANT TO HELP send me an email at loosechangetoloosenchains@gmail.com and I'll send you the toolkit to get started.

1.  Raise awareness.  Get informed and tell everyone you know about modern day slavery.  You can get up to speed at www.freetheslaves.net
2.  Raise funds.  Free the Slaves works with small local groups on the ground who investigate cases of slavery, rescue the victims and help them build a hopeful future.
3.  Use your influence.  Demand that your favorite companies don't benefit from slave labor -- especially in the chocolate, coffee and garment industries.  
4.  Check back often to learn what else you can do.

1. 27 million people are still in slavery today. It's estimated that 50 % are children.

2. They may be tricked with the promise of a good job, deceived or sold, working in brothels, brick kilns, on plantations and in many industries.

3. We can provide the freedom they're praying for.
