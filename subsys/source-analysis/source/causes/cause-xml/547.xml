  <description>DHMO, which stands for Dihydrogen Monoxide, is a colorless and odorless compound. Also known as Hydric Acid, it is a dangerous substance that has made its way into our food and water supplies. Its use in industry is widespread despite the fact that it is a major contributor to acid rain. 

There are several dangerous effects of DHMO that have been well-documented. First of all, it can be fatal to a human being in very small quantities. It has been known to cause the corrosion and oxidation of metals. It causes erosion of the land and is associated with deadly natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods. 

However, the government continues to endorse the use of DHMO and we feel that the public has been kept in the dark for too long. Our goal is to make the use of DHMO illegal and phase it completely out of our environment by the year 2010.

&lt;This is only a brief summary of the dangers of DHMO provided by the Dihydrogen Monoxide Research Division; further information about DHMO and this wonderful organization can be found at http://www.dhmo.org/facts.html&gt;


1. DHMO is a dangerous chemical compound whose use must be stopped immediately.

2. Public awareness of the dangers of DHMO must be increased as years of government suppression have kept America in the dark.

3. More research must be done looking for ways to phase DHMO out of our environment completely before any more damage is done.</description>
