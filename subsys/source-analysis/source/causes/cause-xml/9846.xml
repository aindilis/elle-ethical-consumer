  <description>To harvest from the woods, fields and various bodies of water animals given and intended to be slain, tastefully prepared (like with butter and herbs), and consumed.

It is our stance that anmials given to us by "Mother Nature" for the purpose of consumption should be awarded said privilege and should never be denied thier destiny! Furthurmore, fine furs, pelts and other wooly parts, we believe, should be used in such a way as to protect humans not created with such natural insulation a warm and fuzzy feeling all over when worn during appropriate to sever chilly weather. In continuation PETA takes a stance against any unethical treatment of people who find themselves in a state of starvation, nutrient wantonness, or relative stomach emptiness ever be denied such meats as would fill and/or satisfy said hankerings.

Please join as we stand up agains the wiles of any who would wish to deny us even the slightest bit of meat when we crave it!

1. We should Arise Kill and Eat

2. Salad is GREAT! Only if followed by a STEAK!

3. In an effort to stay the hand of global warming we will terminate some of the natural producers of Methane gas including but not limited to pigs, cows, moose and buffalo.</description>
