  <description>Each day, thousands of people across the world spend their time indoors, or ruin the environment.  With the threat of Global Warming on the rise and the possibility that the wilderness could disappear forever, its time to do something about it.  This cause was established to educate people about the beauty of Nature, and how to appreciate it.  Nature is my friend, why can't she be your friend too?

1. To educate people on the appreciation of the outdoors.

2. To get people outside and living again.

3. To protect Nature and the outdoors.</description>
