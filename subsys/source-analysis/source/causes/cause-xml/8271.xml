  <description>How many times have you seen some mercedes benz driving ass wipe in a suit yelling and screaming at a 14 year old grocery teller at the super makret? Is his life really that bad? This is for you, grocery teller boy.

And what about all those soccer moms who want their coffee....and they want it right- fucking- now-damnit! This is for you Starbucks girl!

For the new guy in town who says Hey, how's it goin, can I know you? And is met with an "uhhh No" by a girl that is too busy being Paris Hilton to extend her hand and introduce herself.

This is for everyone....so they can be reminded that life is an awesome thing......Why? Because of the people in it! All whom were strangers at some point! You'll never know the things you'll miss on if your too busy being an asshole people.  

So here's to actually getting to know the people around us on more then a superficial level, for being open and real and compassionate.

So Basically, chill the fuck out man, have some fun, and be nice :) 

1. Wake Up

2. Be a little selfless (Smile at someone?!?!)

3. Go to bed a better person</description>
