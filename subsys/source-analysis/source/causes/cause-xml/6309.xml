  <description>126,000 babies in the world die every day from abortion. 4,400 in the US alone. That's over 44 million a year in the world. Over 1/3 of our generation has been murdered. There is an abortion every 20 seconds. We've surpassed the deaths of the Jewish Holocaust and any war. We need to end this. &lt;a href="httP://silentday.org"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.standtrue.com/pages/07banner01.jpg" width="300px" height="50px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
