You may have or may not have heard about the petition I have going here at teensWts. It's to put a stop to the negative portrayal of Tourette Syndrome in todays media. Basically, people have been 'taking' Coprolalia and running with it like it's actually entertainment to make fun of people with TS. And unfortunately, some people believe it is. Why? Well, some just are not educated, some are quite inconsiderate, I'm sure others have an excuse, and some people with TS say they like to laugh at themselves when frankly, these portrayals are totally off the wall and just flat out "picking on people". As elementary as it sounds, that's just what it is.
I have been "hit", more than once, with people saying there was nothing they could do, for the sake of freedom of speech. Well ok then, I will express my freedom of speech, and they will not hear the end of this. If anyone would like to help with the petition or if you have any ideas, please email me. teensWts@gmail.com
