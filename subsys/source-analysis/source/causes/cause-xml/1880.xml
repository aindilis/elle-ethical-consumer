  <description>For 60 years, Heifer has transformed the lives of millions of families by giving them gifts of cows, goats and other livestock.  Along the animals, families receive extensive training in animal care and learn environmentally friendly agricultural practices.  Each gift of livestock starts a chain reaction of self-reliance that spreads throughout the entire communities because each family who receives an animal agrees to "pass on the gift" by sharing the offspring of their animal to others in need.

Heifer works directly with local grassroots community groups to determine which animals are most appropriate and sustainable for the environment.  After extensive training in how to care for the animals and the environment and to maintain their resources, high quality animals are given to the qualifying group.  These animals provide milk, income, labor and food which improve long term quality of life for some of the poorest areas of the world.  Each recipient agrees to "pass on the gift" by giving one or more of their gift animal's offspring or the cash equivalent to another family in need.
