  <description>Damascus (&#1583;&#1605;&#1588;&#1602; transliteration: Dimashq, also commonly known as &#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1575;&#1605; ash-Sh&#257;m) is the largest city of Syria and is also the capital. It is thought to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, before Al Fayyum, and Gaziantep. Its current population is estimated at about 4.5 million. The city is a governorate by itself, and the capital of the governorate of Rif Dimashq (Rural Damascus).

The old city of Damscus is now suffering of neglect and mistreatment.

We need to recruit as many of us as we can, to tell those in charge to take some action to get the old city back to life.

Here we can show our voices. and on this group http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2442538013 we can show our photos since a photo tells a 1000 words.


1. Get the old city of Damscus back to life

2. Tell those sitting behind the dimmed glass of their cars "CAN'T YOU SEE!!?"

3. Tell everyone thinking we're "blind" or "stupid" that "WE'RE NOT"... "WE CAN SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING!"</description>
