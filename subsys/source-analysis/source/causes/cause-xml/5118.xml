  <description>Soft drinks are intended as a treat, not a mainstay of your diet. Too much of any food product is probably not good for you. As far as being "healthy", soda is not health food, it's just water, sugar, and flavorings, with a little carbon dioxide in the mix to add bubbles. If you add carbon dioxide to plain water, or carbonate the water, the carbonation produces carbonic acid. This acid is much weaker than the hydrochloric acid that your stomach produces naturally.
