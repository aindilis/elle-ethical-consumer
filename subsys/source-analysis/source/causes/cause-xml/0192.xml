  <description>Help the Afghan Children's (HTAC) vision is for an Afghanistan in which all children have access to education and healthcare, and are able to contribute positively to their families, communities, and nation. We envision Afghan children who have access to quality, comprehensive community-based schools to help them mature as individuals who have the will and capability of bringing stability and prosperity to Afghanistan and to the world.

 
HTAC's mission is to help Afghan children become educated, healthy, and productive citizens who are able to fully contribute to building Afghanistan's civil society. We accomplish this by working with supporting partners to establish model community-based schools in different regions of Afghanistan; by providing training to local educators to enhance their professional capacities; and by developing and introducing innovative learning programs.

1. Children are the future of our communities, nations, and world

2. Every child and orphan deserves shelter, food, medicine, and education

3. We must bring hope to the ravaged nation of Afghanistan and it's children</description>
