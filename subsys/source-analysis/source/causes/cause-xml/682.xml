  <description>A Donation of $7 a month to The Mocha Club will:

Feed 1 person for a month
Educate 2 children for 1 school term
Save 1 person from Malaria
Provide clean water to 7 Africans for 1 year

1. To be a part of the solution to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we focus on educating both children and adults, providing medical attention to the infected, and eliminating poverty.

2. $7 a month can provide things to refugees in Sudan such as mosquito nets to prevent malaria, tarps that can serve as homes to cover them during the rainy season, food, clean water, and desperately needed medication.

3. help build the Village of Hope in Gulu,Uganda where nearly 500 of child mothers can live in a safe community of huts with a workshop, a school, and a job training center. </description>
