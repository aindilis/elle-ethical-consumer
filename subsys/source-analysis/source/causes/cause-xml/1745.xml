1. Of the more than 35,000 cities, towns, and villages in Italy, less than 1,500 have an evangelical church.

2. Avant Ministries is sending a team of nine missionaries to the city of Genoa, Italy, where fewer than 1400 of the city's 700,000 people have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. 

3. Ignited for Christ, Genoa would become internationally influential for the Kingdom of Jesus Christ. Team Italy is scheduled to arrive in Genoa in the fall of 2007. You can help ignite Italy for Christ and transform the lives of Italian people.</description>
