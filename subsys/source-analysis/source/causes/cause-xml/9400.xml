  <description>I believe that humanity needs a strong, well-educated and spiritually satisfied Glenn.  For far too long, Glenn has been hindered in his quest to attain greatness by various dark, demonic forces both internal and external to him and a basic lack of funds.  He currently wears the jeweled crown of Fairbanks, Alaska upon a troubled brow and is considering returning to Vancouver for a few weeks to find himself and finish this God-Forsaken Thesis From Hell.  He has also considered finding some sort of temporary work to help to pay his bills, but it has occurred to him that he is far, far too pretty to have to work like everyone else.  Not to mention that it is his destiny to save humanity from itself and he kinda thinks that the planet owes him one on that count.......

1. Glenn must finish his thesis come Hell or High Water so that he can briefly return to Winnipeg and pin it to his boss's desk with a Rambo knife

2. Glenn must have access to a bottomless well of funds

3. Glenn's spiritual difficulties can only be solved in the boosum of a kind, understanding and endlessly horny woman</description>
