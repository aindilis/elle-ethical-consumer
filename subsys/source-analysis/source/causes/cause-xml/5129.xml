  <description>Sikhs were promised an independent homeland by
Mahatma Gandhi if the British left India in 1947.
Muslims were promised an independent homeland also and they received Pakistan. Sikhs were told to wait and we are still waiting.
I suggest Sikhs achieve a State of Khalistan by peaceful means and by organizing via sending money from all Gurdwaras from around the world into a single fund to bring about the pressure to create a Sikh homeland.  
I would suggest any members of any Gurdwara from anywhere in the world send any donations to me and I will set up a Khalistan Creation Fund or send them directly to Harmunder Sahib in Amritsar because that is probably where I would fly to and consult with Ghanis there to see where the funds could best be used. 
I also suggest we model what the Jews did for creation of their own State of Israel that recently celebrated its 60th Birthday.
Send donations to: 
Sukhraj Singh Gill,
14711, 78th Avenue, Surrey, BC, V3S8Z4.
