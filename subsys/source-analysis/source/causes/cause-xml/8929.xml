  <description>I hate that people believe that religions are so different that its right to kill the other religion. Is a religion not but just a thing where we believe in how to live our life and what happens afterward? Thats truely what a religion is. In my middle school I saw some of the worst religion jokes. I was horrified when I heard some of the jokes. I am hear to protect the respect we should have for each other, and what we believe in.

1. Christians must stop hating jews.

2. Jews should respect that christians think the saviors come

3. stop thinking all buddists are from quick-e-mart

4. that anybody can be any religion</description>
