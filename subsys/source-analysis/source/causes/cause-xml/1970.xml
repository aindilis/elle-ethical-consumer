Equality Now works to end violence and discrimination against women and girls around the world through the mobilization of public pressure. Issues of concern to Equality Now include:

RAPE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS TRAFFICKING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION POLITICAL PARTICIPATION GENDER DISCRIMINATION

As fans of Joss Whedon's Firefly and Serenity, we Browncoats have participated in much fund-raising for Equality Now. We aim to keep this momentum going and seek support from other kind-hearted, spirited people out there in the 'verse. Women's rights should not be an issue in this day and age but sadly, we are still eons behind in the quest for equal rights.  

Help.  Donate. Learn more.  Treat the world and its inhabitants with dignity and kindness.

1. Women are entitled to fair and equal practice in the world.

2. We can affect big changes with just a little kindness and awareness.</description>
