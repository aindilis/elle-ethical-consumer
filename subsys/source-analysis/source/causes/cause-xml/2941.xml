  <description>	This is a group for all the people who believe that it is high time to have peace in the Middle East.
I refuse to believe that this world consist of people who rather turn there head when there is someone in trouble, the Middle-East has been in trouble for a long time...it is time for people to stand up &amp; say enough is enough...
We demand that the leaders work harder to resolve ALL issues so that our children can grow up in a future where there is peace in the Middle-East...
If u agree then please sign up &amp; pass this forward to everyone.
I don't care if you are Palestinian, Israeli, Iranian, German, American, Black, White, Pink, Yellow...we are all humans &amp; we all bleed...tell you another secret it is RED no matter where you are from &amp; which God you belive in...
It is time to stand together &amp; make our voice heard...
This is a peaceful group, so if you prefer other ways to make your stand please do so somewhere else...
I wish everybody welcome.
Peace, 
Badboni

1. Peace is the only solution people can live with.

2. This can save a lot of lives on both sides.

3. Killing eachother is not going to solve anything!!</description>
