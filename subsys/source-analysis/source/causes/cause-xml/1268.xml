  <description>It's not pediatric cancer. It's not juvenile diabetes. But like these diseases, it kills children.

Familial Dysautonomia (pronounced "dys-auto-NO-mia" and referred to as FD) is a hereditary disorder that affects the nervous system. A typical cold for you or me can be life threatening to a victim of FD.

Children and adults with FD experience decreased or poor pain perception, which means they could break an arm and not even know it. They may also suffer from erratic or unstable blood pressure that causes them to feel dizzy and sometimes faint. They often have trouble swallowing so they are fed through tubes directly into their stomachs. Most suffer from scoliosis and some are blind. Any number of problems can arise from this debilitating disease.

FD is a way of life. Different from yours or mine, or any other "normal" person around us. FD is born the moment the child is born, and from that moment it affects every aspect of his or her life.

FD is not a malady, a virus or a bacteria. It is not contagious and cannot be acquired after birth.
