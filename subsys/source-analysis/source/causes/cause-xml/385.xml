  <description>Lupus is an autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, joints, heart, lungs, blood, kidneys and brain. Normally the body's immune system makes antibodies to protect the body against viruses, bacteria, and other foreign materials. In an autoimmune disorder, like lupus, the immune system cannot tell the difference between foreign substances and its own cells and tissues. The immune system then makes antibodies directed against itself (auto-antibodies) which cause inflammation, pain and damage in various parts of the body.

The Lupus Foundation of America (LFA) estimates between 1.5 - 2 million Americans have a form of lupus, but the actual number may be higher. More than 90% of people with lupus are women. Symptoms and diagnosis occur most often when women are in their child-bearing years, between the ages of 15 and 45, but Lupus can affect anyone.

Donations from individuals, corporations, foundations, and organizations enable the Lupus Foundation of America (LFA) to conduct and expand its programs of life-saving medical research, education and patient advocacy to bring an end to lupus. Together we can make a difference!
