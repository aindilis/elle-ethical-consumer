  <description>Pancreatic cancer starts in the cells of the pancreas. The pancreas is a glandular organ that lies behind the stomach. It produces proteins (enzymes) to help digest food, and insulin, which regulates sugar levels in our blood. The pancreas is attached to a section of the small intestine called the duodenum, and to the ducts that carry bile from the liver to the small intestine. These other organs can be damaged as pancreatic cancer develops, causing jaundice and digestion difficulties. 
 Depending on the extent of the tumor at the time of diagnosis, the prognosis is generally regarded as poor, with few victims still alive 5 years after diagnosis, and complete remission still extremely rare.
