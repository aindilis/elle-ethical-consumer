  <description>We all know someone who has been @ Sick Kids Hospital, or has been a "Sick Kid" at one point in time. This is the one charity I have been supporting for close to 2 years, and I feel that we all should do our part..after all we need to invest in the future, and CHILDREN are the FUTURE. Please support the cause and the essence of innocence...KIDS! The hospital's slogan says it best: "BEST ODDS FOR YOU. BEST ODDS FOR SICK CHILDREN."
