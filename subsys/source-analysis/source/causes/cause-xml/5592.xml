  <description>Timecode: NOLA is a television program that showcases short films, animations, and informative pieces that highlight filmmaking as well as spotlight the film community in the New Orleans area. Our focus is on local filmmakers, but we also scour the region and the world for quality films that are being made outside the mainstream. Besides merely presenting quality short films, Timecode: NOLA also provides interviews with the artists, information on New Orleans area film happenings, and cutting
edge original content. Timecode: NOLA is founded on and remains committed to presenting film, animations, and filmmakers to a broader audience with a uniquely New Orleans feel and presentation. This can mean many things to many people, but the fact the producers are New Orleans natives gives the show and its companion website a distinctive perspective. A perspective as inimitable and complex
as the city of New Orleans itself.
