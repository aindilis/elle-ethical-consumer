  <description>So many people have more than they need. So many people have the ability to give to those in need, yet don't. If we would all join together, become ONE, we could change the world. There is nothing that is out of our reach. If everybody gives what they can, then we can wipe out poverty, destroy HIV/AIDS, and eliminate Malaria and Tuberculosis.

1. People who have the ability to give should give to those in need.

2. HIV/AIDS is a growing problem that is in dire need of a solution.

3. Malaria and TB sometimes go unremembered, but are still large problems.</description>
