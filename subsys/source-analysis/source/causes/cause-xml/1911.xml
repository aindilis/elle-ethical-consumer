  <description>The government gives themselves a 50% increase, but they cannot give the public servants including nurses and teachers 12%.

Many people will argue that government officials get paid too much, but no one will argue that public servants do. THEY NEED THE MONEY AND WE NEED THEM!!!

We want the strike to end - and the people to get the money they deserve

1. Public workers should get their 12%

2. Students should be allowed to learn and write exams at school safely

3. Negotiations should take place expediantly</description>
  <mission>Get the public servants their wage increases so we can go back to school and write exams safely</mission>
