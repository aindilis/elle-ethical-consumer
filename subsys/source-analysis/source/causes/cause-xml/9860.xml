  <description>The Movement

Inspired by the world Justin, also known as Jason Jacobs decided to start a movement. By movement he means make a change and difference in the world. The Jason Jacobs movement is meant to bring acceptance to minorities in the world, and end stigmas on people who have been given stigma from society. It's my personal belief that we the people in the world, can help minimize hate, and bring a more peaceful and appreciative world view on these minorities. I dont believe that anyone should be looked down upon becasue of sex, gender, orientation, mental state, etc. It is my goal to help build a better, and more unified world and raise money especially for mental illness organizations. I hope that everyone will help support this movement to a better and more accepting world and get involved.
