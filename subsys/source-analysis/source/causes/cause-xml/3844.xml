  <description>This is a cause designed to educate people in the fact that we couldn't destroy the planet even if we wanted to.

The Earth has been here for billions of years. 200 years  of human activity could not possibly cause irreparable damage to the environment.

Ways to maximize your carbon footprint:

Leave your computer on all the time.
Set your computer to never turn off your monitor (just be sure to but a screen saver on)
Stay up an hour later every night.
Leave your TV on when going on a vacation (just mute it)
Leave the lights in your attic/basement on
Turn your thermostat up/down a degree
NO FLUORESCENTS!

If you can think of any others, message me.
