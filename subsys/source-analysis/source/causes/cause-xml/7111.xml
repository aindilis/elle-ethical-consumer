  <description>For 20 years, the Lord's Resistance Army and the Northern Uganda government have been fighting over the government and land. Children ages 5-15 have been abducted and placed in the Lord's Resistance Army. I started this cause to show others that there are horrible things happening to children and families over in Uganda. Please support them!

1. Children should never be forced to hold an AK-47.

2. Fanaticist groups (LRA) should not be allowed to control like they do in Uganda

3. Our government should hold peace talks in Uganda.

4. Americans should help and support the fight for peace--not just ignore it.

5. The terrorized towns should be rebuilt.

6. The 800+ schools that were shut down should be re-opened.

7. Families should get help finding a source of income.

8. War, poverty, and despair should NEVER be ignored.</description>
