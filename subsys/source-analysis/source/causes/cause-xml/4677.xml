  <description>Aung San Suu Kyi was born June 19, 1945. Her father, Aung San, was a well known man in Burma for his movement towards independence. In 1947, two years after she was born, her father was assassinated by a rival political group.

Aung San Suu Kyi followed in her father&#8217;s footsteps and attempted to build a democratic Burma. In 1960, she was appointed the Burmese Ambassador to India. In 1988, she returned home to care for her mother, who had suffered a stroke. During this stay at home, the current leader of Burma at the time, General Saw Maung, resigned. This caused a mass uprising, and many civilians were killed.

One month later, on August 15, she made a public speech to the people of Burma outside of the Shwedagon Pagoda. Thousands of people came to listen to her speech which expressed her hopes and ideas for a democratic government. Shortly after that speech she was put under her first house arrest by the military dictatorship.


   Since that speech, she has been UNFAIRLY put under house arrest on and off for the past 18 years.

 Aung San Suu Kyi is not a criminal, and should NOT be held under house arrest for leading peaceful speeches promoting democracy for the people of Burma.
