  <description>The American Rights at Work Education Fund is an educational and outreach organization dedicated to informing the public about the current climate of workers&#8217; rights and the barriers they face when working to organize unions and collective bargain with employers.  We work to educate the public on the link between workers&#8217; rights and human rights and the historical importance of the labor movement to all Americans, organized or otherwise.</description>
