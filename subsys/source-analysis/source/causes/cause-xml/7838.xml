  <description>Through this brand-new philanthropy at Kansas State University, students will come together and help clean up the reputation of specific events in the Manhattan community by making Aggieville "better than they left it".  Specifically, the program will focus on clean-up after the Homecoming parade and "Fake Patty's Day".

In addition to clean-sweeping Aggieville, students will be available to volunteer outside of these two main activities.  We will be accepting monetary donations and canned goods for local charities and a student scholarship fund.  Also, we will be accepting prizes to raffle off to our volunteers in an attempt to raise more money by selling raffle tickets for $1.00 each. 

If you have any questions, please contact the Co-Founders of Better Than They Left It:
