  <description>Most college kids put their health on the back burner for 4 years (or however long you decide to stick around)... And these are the years that will shape your future. It's a lifestyle change you're committing to, not just a quick fix. You should be getting 3 to 5 days of exercise, which includes both weight and cardio training. Keep in mind that you also have to have a diet, too. DIET and EXERCISE are key to maintaining a healthy body, and to stay "young at heart."

1. Cadio can be your best friend!

2. Weight lifting will not make you huge, unless you train and eat to be big.

3. It's a lifestyle change you're wanting, not a quick fix.</description>
