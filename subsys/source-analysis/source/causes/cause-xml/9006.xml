  <description>Sandhoff disease is a rare, genetic disease. In this disease, there is a defect in a cellular enzyme that normally helps break down certain fatty products (called sphingolipids). Since the enzyme is defective, these fatty products don&#8217;t get broken down and start building up in the body instead. This is very damaging to cells in the body, especially in the brain. There are different types of Sandhoff disease, depending on the age in which the signs and symptoms start occurring. These types are called infantile-onset, juvenile-onset, and adult onset.

PROGNOSIS:    Unfortunately, a cure for Sandhoff disease has not yet been found, and children with the infantile-type of this disease have survived in the past to about 3 years of age. However, there are many studies of Sandhoff disease that are being done. Researchers are trying to find medications to stop the fatty products from building up in the cells, especially those in the brain. They are also trying to find medications to prevent the fatty products from being made in the first place. Other newer studies are focusing on decreasing inflammation in the brain to try to increase the number of healthy brain cells. Hopefully, helpful medications will be found through these studies
