  <description>When joining you have to give at least one item of clothing to any homeless person you see, If you don't wear it give it someone who will (and who's probably freezing their butts off). And You must post a pic of yourself giving it them (use ur cell).

This is not a joke, I wanna see all the people on my friends list post a pic of them giving at least 1 item of clothing to a homeless person.



1. We must clothe the homeless of the world

2. It's cold!!!

3. I can make a difference (so can you)</description>
