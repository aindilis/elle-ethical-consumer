  <description>We want to get more people in the USA to support and help make the great sport of soccer more popular. Every other country in the world loves this game because anyone can play it. You don't need pads, or gloves, or even shoes to play it, making it easily affordable, and a universal language of peace. Everyone who has a love and passion for this game needs to spread the word, and help make this sport a lasting success in a country that does not understand it.

1. To help bring soccer off of the back burner of America and put it in the spotlight.</description>
