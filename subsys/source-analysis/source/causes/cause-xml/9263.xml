  <description>How We Make Change

The Clinton Foundation measures the success of its work by a single question: Are people better off now than when we started?

For the 750,000 people living with HIV/AIDS who are now accessing life-saving antiretroviral treatments thanks to the Foundation&#8217;s price reductions &#8211; or for the 6,000 farmers in eastern Rwanda who enjoyed their first maize surplus in decades after the Foundation expanded their access to advanced agricultural techniques &#8211; the answer is yes.

The Foundation works with urgency, applying a unique business-oriented approach to address some of Africa&#8217;s most pressing challenges &#8211; specifically the HIV/AIDS epidemic, climate change and poverty. By partnering with countries and local communities, the Foundation is facilitating &#8211; not dictating &#8211; lasting change in these developing countries. And by implementing systems and changing the economics of these problems, the Foundation is empowering people to work towards a better life for them and their children.
