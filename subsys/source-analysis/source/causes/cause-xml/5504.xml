  <description>For those of you who dont know Jacob Varughese, he is one of the nicest, hardest working, and smartest young men I have ever met.  He does everything he can to better his life, but his efforts fail.  His dad won't help him, so I thought we should.  A few dollars here and a few dollars there may not seem like much, but in the end it can get this young man a form of transportation.  After this first mission is accomplished, we will branch out to help other kind people who need a hand.  ONE LOVE EVERYONE! GOD BLESS

1. love god
