  <description>We are the hope, the voice, and awareness for those who are starving, for those killed in the Holocaust, for Holocaust survivors, but most especially: for a genocide that we can still fight...


-DARFUR, SUDAN-
Rape and slaughtering. The Janjaweed group in Sudan has been killing off high numbers of Darfur residents and forcing them out of their homes for years. The Sudanese government has denied that it supports the Janjaweed, but they have provided money and assistance in joint attacks with the group, targeting the Fur, Zaghawa, and Massaleit ethnic groups in Darfur. The conflict began in July of 2003. 3 YEARS AGO. It's genocide. There should be no questions about that. So what are we doing? Nothing. And the 'something' we are doing is not enough.


How long will we wait to step in? History is repeating itself...and we've got to do our part to end these New Era Holocausst.
