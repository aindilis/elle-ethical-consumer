  <description>Right now, girls your age are being kidnapped, sold, and forced to work as prostitutes. YOU can help save them. This issue is extremely underestimated!!! It is a worse matter than you think. There are three actions stated in the August 2007 edition of Seventeen magazine. You can do any or all of the following three actions to save these innocent lives: A. Wear the bracelet: Buy one of the glow-in-the-dark bracelets (about $2, plus shipping) at globalangels.org to rescue girls from dangerous situations and help them heal. B. Sign On: It's easy to send a message to the United Nations that sexual slavery and human trafficking of all kinds must end -- just sign the petition at stopthetraffick.org C. Spare Some Change: Put those coins at the bottom of your bag to good use by joining the International Justice Missions Loose Change to Loosen Chains campaign. All the cash you collect goes to campaigns that help stop slavery. Sign up at ijm.org. Please everyone! This is a major subject that needs to be dealt with!!!!!
