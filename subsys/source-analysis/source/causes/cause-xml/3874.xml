  <description>The United States intends to deport Mr. Sameh Khouzam back to Egypt on MONDAY, JUNE 18, at the request of the Egyptian government, despite the fact that Mr. Khouzam faces torture and death upon his return.

Mr. Khouzam escaped Egypt and fled to America in 1998 after he was detained by the Egyptian government and forcefully "encouraged" to convert from his Coptic Christianity to Islam. After his departure, the Egyptian government informed United States officials that Mr. Khouzam was wanted for completely unsubstantiated crimes against a Muslim family.

There is no concrete or verifiable evidence he has committed any crimes. Mr. Khouzam is facing torture and death primarily because he is a member of a religious minority in Egypt. However, the U.S. Government simply will not act to prevent this terrible injustice unless confronted by an overwhelming outpouring of outrage from its citizens. Please fill in the form below to sign our petition to save the life of Mr. Sameh Khouzam. We will deliver these signatures immediately to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and to Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice.
