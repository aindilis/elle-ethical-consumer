  <description>The 11th Hour is the last moment when change is possible. Leonardo DiCaprio&#8217;s &#8220;The 11th Hour&#8221; is a feature length documentary concerning the current environmental crises caused by human actions and our future impact on the planet.

&#8220;The 11th Hour&#8221; documents the cumulative impact of these actions upon the planet&#8217;s life systems and calls for restorative action through a reshaping of human activity. The most powerful element of the film is the offering of hope and solutions. Scientists and environmental advocates paint a portrait for a radically new and exciting future in which humanity seeks not to dominate the earth&#8217;s life systems, but to coexist with them in harmony. &#8220;The 11th Hour&#8221; calls for a future now within our grasp that is both sustainable and healthier.
