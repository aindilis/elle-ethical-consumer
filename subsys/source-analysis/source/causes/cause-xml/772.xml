  <description>At CBU, we have so many ISP teams, and it is so great! However, none go to Darfur. What I am trying to do is somehow persuade the ISP coordinators to make an ISP team Darfur in the coming years. It may be too dangerous to send anyone now, but we need to share the love of God with these poor people. All they know now is death, hunger, sadness, and hopelessness. Who wants to live like that? No one... and no one should ever have to. God needs our help spreading His word, everyone should know about it. Maybe someday there might be an end to the death, hunger, sadness, and hopelessness. Sure we can't end it all, but gosh, we can at least try to bring hope. You don't need to donate anything, just help spread the word out on campus, and that would be great. 

1. Psalm 46:10- "Be still and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth."</description>
