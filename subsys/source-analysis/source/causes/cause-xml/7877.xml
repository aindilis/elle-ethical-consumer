  <description>This is the beginning of what we hope to be a world wide organization to save the world. We know this sounds a little unrealistic but we think with the support of the citizens of people in countries worldwide we can tackle the problems in each of our societies that are hurting us as a whole. If we look at each issue carefully and work together to solve it than there is nothing that we cannot overcome. We feel that free-flowing dialogue is an extremely important and often overlooked aspect of solving the problems we have today. We want to have one big conversation with the human race to figure out what the hell is going on. We also figure that hey--somebody out there probably has it figured out. And if not...we all have partial truths to contribute to create a whole solution.  


Who Should Join:
Anyone... really anyone, if you feel like you have something to contribute We want to hear it. We have my ears open to ideas from all of you and I hope that any member of this organization would be able to listen and process the ideas of others so that we can effectively work as a unit. We want to bring together those who feel their voices are not being heard with those who can make them heard.  


1. Everyone is connected.

2. Poverity must be put to an end.

3. The environment must be saved.

4. Everyone's voice worldwide should be heard.</description>
