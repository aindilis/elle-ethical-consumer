  <description>The Cinderella Society works hand in hand with Gilda's Club of North Texas by sponsoring Caps for Cancer hat drives at local businesses, churches, clubs and schools.  Cards for Cancer is another program.  It is children making cards for children and caring for peers.  We collect donated prom dresses for the Cooks Children Medical Center Prom held in the Spring, and we participate in parties hosted by Queen For A Day in the pediatric cancer units.  We donate and encourage others to donate hair to Locks of Love for children's wigs.  We are always looking for new ideas and ways to show love to these children.  "A Smile Will Cure A Bad Day"


1. It is our sincere desire to cast away the cares of the day by promoting self confidence, bravery, a sense of belonging and a positive self image.
