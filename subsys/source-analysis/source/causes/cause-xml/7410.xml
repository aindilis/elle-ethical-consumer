Each year, Inclusive Communities conducts educational programs, conferences, retreats, and workshops for thousands of youth, educators, community members, non-profit organizations, and corporate and business leaders. These events and experiences teach participants not simply to notice differences, but also to respect variety in race, religion and culture.  We deliver our message in schools, houses of worship, the community, and in the workplace.

Our organization traces its roots back to 1935 in Virginia.  With a lengthy and rich history, we have been destined to change with the times, even as we work to change the times in which we live.  Originally founded as the Virginia Region of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities has concluded our association with NCCJ and has joined with many of our fellow offices across the country to become the cornerstone of a new movement fighting prejudice in all its forms.
