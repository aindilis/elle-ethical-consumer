  <description>The City of Baltimore is infected with drugs, and everyone is suffering from the symptoms. We've lived this way for years. But now it has finally reached our children. Our future. The drug business will never go away by itself. We need to end it. And everyone has a job to do. Everyone needs to do at least one thing.

1. Save our city.

2. Protect our communities.

3. Confront the problem.</description>
