  <description>Oliver Westwood and Nicholas Abel were once sitting infront of a computer in the computer lab in the library in the school of UNIS, when they realized they could make money if they created a cause on facebook where lots of rich people give away money to people they don't know if they can trust or not; the people they're giving money to could go straight to their pockets, which is not what we want. We would prefer it if the people KNEW the money was actually going straight into the person's pocket.
So donate money, to get us food.

1. People shouldn't give away money to groups that will lie and misuse the money.

2. Canada's seal hunt must end immediately.</description>
