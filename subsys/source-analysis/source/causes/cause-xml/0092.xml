  <description>Hermeneutics is the theory of interpretation.  There are lenses through which an understanding of the world evolves.  A simple example would be that before the Enlightenment, the religious interpretation of the world was that God had set everything in motion and it was up to us to live within the Divine, immutable drama.  With the Enlightenment, an interpretation of the world evolved that the world was a mutable place, where we could discern the laws of science and change the world accordingly.  Since the Enlightenment, many other schools of interpretation have evolved and it is imperative that a literate society understands the ways in which it views the world.  Our very future depends upon it.
