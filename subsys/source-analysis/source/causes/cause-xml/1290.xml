  <description>The events that struck the campus of Virginia Tech on the morning of April 16th, 2007 will not soon be forgotten. Nor will the memories of the Hokie students and faculty who lost their lives on that day. A campus was changed forever but it has been demonstrated with absolute certainty that no act of evil will ever keep the Hokies from uniting in support of one another.

The world has seen the strength of the Hokie Nation on display since the day of the tragedy and although we will continue to mourn, we will always persevere.
