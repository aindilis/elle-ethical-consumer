  <description>We started as a small group with the crazy dream to walk from Finch station to York University (which for all you who don't live in T.O. is like a 2hr walk) and now we wanted to put our walk for charity. So we are walking from Toronto to Niagara Falls over the span of 7 days (total walking time is 20+ hours) for the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. We are hoping to raise $1,000 by our walk which is going to be from August 20th-26th 2007. So we would appreciate any kind of support possible...whether you want to come out and join us or donate to the cause. And please feel free to invite other people since it is a good cause! Thanks everyone. 

1. To help fund much needed research in support of the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation

2. To have a forum where people can share their thoughts and personal experience with Breast cancer</description>
