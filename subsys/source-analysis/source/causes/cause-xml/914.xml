This is an amazing organization I have been involved with for many years. The residents of the Angel View homes are constantly smiling and happy despite the fact that they might not be able to walk, speak, or live a "normal" lifestyle.
My friends and I have enjoyed spending time with  the residents of these facilities and have created close relationships with them. Volunteers are always welcome and hours can be done by just chatting, playing board games, watching TV, and by just being a friend. Let these inspirational kids make a difference in your life!
