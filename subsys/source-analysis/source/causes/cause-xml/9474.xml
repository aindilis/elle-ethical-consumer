  <description>For to long, ducks have been the victims of assault and violence just for someone to hold something together. This is wrong and also funny. What is in a duck that can be made into something sticky to hold stuff together very well. Duct tape is necessary for almost everything that needs fixing, but is the life of a few ducks worth it? If we keep trapping ducks and killing them for duck tape we will be getting rid of a tradition in Michigan that is know through out the world and is even on cartoons; duck season. If we dont stop killing ducks for duct tape, there will be no ducks to shoot at during duck season. So please help these ducks and let them die the right way, with a couple bullets in their body.

1. Ducks are the essense of duct tape</description>
