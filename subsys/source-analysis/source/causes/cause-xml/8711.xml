  <description>Fred is smart, he is a lot like ROnald Reagan. He has a big heart, he loves what he does and loves america. I see an angel when I look at fred, and satan when I look at Hillary. Reagn had a big heart for america too. You can tell by looking at them and listening to them talk.

1. A free country
