  Stop Animal Abuse is a cause that everybody should join. Two ways you can do this is by, donating money or adopting from a local shelter! My dog was abused as a puppy, but then my uncle took him into foster care where he was loved unconditionally. During Thanksgiving time my uncle gave him to us, we had been looking for a puppy for a while. My dog, Stitch, is one of the cutest dogs. It is a shame to know that he was abused...HELP US STOP THE ABUSING!!
