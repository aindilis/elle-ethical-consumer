  <description> I am going to raise pledges and walk 5 KM to help   make a difference in finding a cure for juvenile diabetes (also know as insulin-dependant or type 1).  

Do you know someone who has diabetes? You probably do since 246 million people in the world have some form of the disease. 

Juvenile (Type 1) diabetes is the most severe form of diabetes as it is unpreventable and strikes infants, children, teens and young adults, leaving them insulin dependent for life and facing a future of uncertainty due to the threat of developing devastating complications. 

Fact: Over 70,000 children worldwide are expected to develop type 1 diabetes annually. Canada has the third highest occurrence rate of Type 1 diabetes in children 14 years or younger in the world and the Type 1 diabetes occurrence rate is rising by 3 - 5% per year. 

By pledging Heather Ward, your money will be going towards finding a cure for this disease by funding some of the most progressive research in the world, most of which is happening right here in Canada. 

You can pledge quickly, efficiently and safely through our secure online pledge option. An electronic tax receipt will be emailed directly to you for donations over $20. Help find a cure for diabetes by clicking the following link:
