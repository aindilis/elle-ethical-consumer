  <description>Project R.A.I.N.B.O.W. (Raising Awareness of Identity 'N' Broadening Our World). Creating awareness among heterosexual as well as non-heterosexual communities about the Rainbow Family. The Rainbow Family includes LGBTQQIA (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Allies). Working to promote gay rights. All proceeds, (if there are any), go to Outright VT for their business.

1. LGBTQQIA should have the same rights as heterosexuals, (marriage, health care, estate rights, etc.).

2. We need anti-discrimination statutes covering sexual orientation AND gender identity/expression, in every state.

3. Youth should have access to education about Queer issues and acceptance.</description>
