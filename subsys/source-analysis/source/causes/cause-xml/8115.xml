  <description>We highly consider the death penalty as uncivilized, cruel, and unusual. Many people were executed without a fair trial, and many were even innocent. The law should NEVER teach the convicts not to murder people, by killing them! We believe that everybody has the right to live no matter what they had done, as backed-up by the Bible. We suggest that the form of punishment used be a life sentence, not a death sentence.
