  <description>College campuses today are ideological battlegrounds for the future of America due to the liberal dominion over college faculty, curriculum, and administration.  This is especially dangerous for the future of America and the Republican Party because partisanship is chosen between the ages of 18 and 24.  We work for the future of the Republican Party and its principles of limited government, opportunity, and freedom.  Every day, we realize our obligation to preserve the Republican Party by balancing debate on California&#8217;s liberal college campuses and fulfilling our mission.  We are here to influence the future now.

CCR is an umbrella organization representing campus-based, student-run College Republican clubs throughout the state.
