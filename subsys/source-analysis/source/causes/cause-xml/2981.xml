  <description>Are you part of the cause?
If you can accept that you&#8217;re part of the cause, yes.


Can you fully accept that your actions directly effect the actions of others?
Do you recognize that our world is in grave danger?

We are in a war with nature; a war we cannot win.
If humanity, in the long run is going to survive we MUST stop fighting one another, and band together, as one species on this earth.

Everything affects everything~
 If we allow any injustice to exist, we can never expect to receive justice ourselves. 
If it&#8217;s one of us, it&#8217;s all of us.

There is no such thing as &#8220;someone else&#8217;s problem&#8221;.
Everyone&#8217;s sorrow must be comforted; not cured
Everyone&#8217;s needs must be validated; not fufilled
Everyone&#8217;s pain is real.
If it&#8217;s one of us, it&#8217;s all of us.

Sometimes there is nothing an individual can do. 
It may seem.
But is not so.

Each individual deserves an equal voice.
But only if they respect/accept that each individual deserves an equal voice, and allow their voice to be influenced by everyone else&#8217;s.

It&#8217;s our belief that if everyone can accept these simple truths into their daily lives, we can create change, for we are the cause of everything that will happen to this world. For better and worse.

More to come.
Yours in truth,
Chris O&#8217;Hara
