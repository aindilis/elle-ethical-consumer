  <description>There is something hindering our progress. 
There are certain people in power ensuring this happens just because they are self interested.
There is death, despair and darkness in the futures of millions of our country folk.
There is very little accountability for those who hold office in our country.
Laws to enhance scruitiny on the culprits are held back as the culprits are in power.
Every generation of Indians will only look up to the corrupt, disorganised, money minded and self loathing politician and more.
All the joining of hands and the collection of large crowds at rallies are paid for by money stolen from the tax payer.
I think it is high time us Indians joined forces to show the ba****ds who have ruined our self pride and public image by their slimey and devious methods. Just an example, national security is becoming politicised and this is compramising our country!.....So either we fight in our own way and educate the masses to stand up for them selves or we allow this virus to slowly engtulf all sectors of our proud nation.
JUST REMEMBER YOU ARE THE POWER NOT THEM YOU, YOU, YOU!.....ALL THAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO JUST REALISE AND FLEX THE MUSCLE OF THE PUBLIC! YOU WILL SEE CHANGE! SO DO YOUR BIT FOR A NATION AND CULTURE WHICH HAS HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH OF CULTURAL AND ETHICAL DEPLETION, ACCOMPANIED BY DIVIDE AND RULE! JAI HIND!!!
