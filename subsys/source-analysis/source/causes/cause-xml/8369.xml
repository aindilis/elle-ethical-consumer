  <description>My name is Theresa Phillippi, and I am part of a family that has HD and my father is the most current one with it. He is 45 and has had the disease for 9 years. He has 7 siblings and 4 have died from it already, all under the age of 40. Its a genetic disorder, and thats what makes it so scary. Every child born to an HD affected parent has a 50% chance of getting it. That means I do. Its also very rare, and not many people know about it, and therefore cant raise awareness and help to fight it. My dad is currently having private homecare with trained nurses because he cant walk, eat by himself, or control his movements. By witnessing 3 of my 4 aunts and uncles die from this awful disease, and watching my father deteriorate rapidly, I am determined to let people know about this disease and hopefully prevent future generations from having it. At this point, there are no known cures, and treatments only help relieve certain symptoms, but dont work very well. It is a terminal disease, meaning the patients who have it will die from it, because theres no cure, and it wont go away on its own.

With the help of others, we can raise awareness of this awful disease, and possibly help future generations of HD families so they will no longer have to suffer.



1. Huntington's Disease NEEDS to be better known

2. People need to get an understanding of the disease and its terrible effects

3. Those affected directly or indirectly by HD need to fight for the right to a cure!</description>
