  <description>I'm taking part in the Waddell &amp; Reed Kansas City Half Marathon on October 20th and I need your help &#8211; well, actually, I need your money! I'm asking for pledges on my behalf for two wonderful organizations here in our community: Children&#8217;s Mercy Hospital and most importantly the Mid-America Chapter of the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. Your pledge will help fund medical care, technology, services, equipment, and facilities in promoting the health and well being of children in the region, from birth through adolescence and will help find a cure for leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and myeloma.  I may not be the first person to cross the finish line, but I will know that my cause to run will mean the world of a difference for a deserving child.

It is so simple.
