  <description>It is becoming all too common, almost routine: Day after day the news media reports another tragic story of a young child's abduction, abuse and murder. Each and every grisly discovery of unspeakable acts committed against the most vulnerable among us fills us with outrage, disbelief, and a desire to do more. These heinous crimes deserve the highest priority on our national agenda.

They viciously victimize innocent children. The recidivism rate for these monsters when released after serving their sentences is extremely high.  

We need to enhance public safety to protect America's children from sexual predators.

We need to act now to save another child from becoming a victim!!

1. Establishing penalty enhancements for those found guilty of committing sexual offenses against children 

2. Creating an integrated nationwide sex offender registry 

3. I believes strongly in protecting the rights of and providing a voice for all victims.</description>
