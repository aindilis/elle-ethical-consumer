<cause>
  <description>As many of you know our family has been very dedicated to this cause for a number of years now. 

Both my wife, Berta and son, Christopher have Type 1 Diabetes.

Berta having had Diabetes now for 33 years has been developing many of the complications which can make daily life exceedingly difficult.

Our hope is that through efforts like this and the support of friends, family and collegues a cure can be found so that Christopher may never know the complications that all diabetics face today.

Thank you for your continued support! Remember there are only 3 days left to get your pledges in!
