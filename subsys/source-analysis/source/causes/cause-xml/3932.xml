  <description>I was wondering if you could do me a huge favor? I'm doing an internship involving health and nutrition, and introducing healthy cooking techniques this summer with a company called Simplicity Gourmet. I have to do 144 presentations this summer to complete my internship. The allow me to give a really nice gift to all of my friends who help me out and let me practice on them. What's really great is, you don't have to buy anything, but if you do see something your really impressed with I can help you order them direct from the manufacturer. So can you help me out? Can I practice on you? Send me a message if you can. I really do appreciate it. You really are helping me out so much. Oh and if you can't maybe you could recommend your parents or friends.
