  <description>The Red Lands Council of the Girl Scouts has been chosen as a pilot program to go into high risk schools during the school hours to teach the girls key leadership skills. The pilot program has forty high risk schools in Oklahoma and 8,000 girls participating! The Girl Scouts invite you to help make this pilot program a success. In order to do this we need your help in one of two ways - you to sponsor girls ($10 per girl) or to volunteer in classrooms only four hours per month. This is a huge opportunity to change the future for these girls! Please feel free to call Ashley Pence at (405) 343-2986 if interested or have any questions.
