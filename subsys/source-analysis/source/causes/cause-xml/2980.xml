  <description>My uncle, Timothy C. Doughtie, died of pancreatic cancer in October of 2006. Since then, I have been looking for ways to raise money for pancreatic cancer research, as well as cancer research in general.

1. Pancreatic cancer must be made treatable.

2. Pancreatic cancer must be made more easily detected.

3. Pancreatic cancer must be curable.</description>
