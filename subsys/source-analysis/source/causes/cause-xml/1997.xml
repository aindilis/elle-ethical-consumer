  <description>To make the world a better place, one less terrorist at a time. And if the terrorists don't give up, we'll invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Democracy.

1. Democracy is a universal right.

2. No one should have to live their lives in fear, afraid that a terrorist is going to blow them and their family up.

3. Everyone should have certain unalienable rights, that no one, not even the terrorists should be able to take those rights away from them.</description>
