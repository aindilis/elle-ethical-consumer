  <description>"We are proud to say that we already sent to South Korea over 180 scarves.  
    Design size should be 6&#8221;x45&#8221; or longer. Our military is made up of men AND women, so you can use some pretty colors other than tans, blues and browns!  
      We are in need of worsted weight yarn, so if you have some that you would like to donate, your efforts will not be in vein.
    This is a great project for children who need service hours.  We can teach them to knit, FREE, and we will sign off on their paperwork.
     Appointments are necessary. All interested, please either come into the shop [address listed below] or give us a call at 954-476-3788."
