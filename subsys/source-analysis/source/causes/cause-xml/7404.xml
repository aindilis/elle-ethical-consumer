  <description>Religiously, Rastas are persecuted daily for their belief in smoking the ganja herb for meditation and enlightenment. Not just this but their freedoms of expression and religious intents are constantly bashed by the government. This cause is to help give Rastas the same religious rights as all others.

1. Ganja should be legal for Religious and recreational Purposes.

2. Dreadlocks should be permitted in all environments. Examples: Schools, Churchs, Work Areas, etc.

3. Rastas should be free from worry about oppression of their religious activities. </description>
