1. Evolution is a scientific theory that helps us to understand the history of life. 

2. It is perfectly acceptable to believe in creationism or intelligent design, but they should not be confused with scientific theories, which rely on hypothesis testing, data collection, and rigorous peer review in order to be accepted as "truth" 

3. Creationism and Intelligent Design cannot be disproven using the scientific method, thus they do not belong in a science class.</description>
