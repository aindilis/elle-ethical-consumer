  <description>The problem with the world is that there aren't enough real life heroes. 

You don't have to have super powers to become a real hero. 

Within each of us is the ability to do something great even if its only within your own community. All we have to do is look for it.

I found the television show Heroes very inspiring. The message behind it of how average people can do above average things and how we are all connected. 

Facebook is just an application that shows us how the "social graph" that connects us all in this very small world has the power to unite the entire planet.

Its time we think in terms of helping one another and the world as a whole.

Join this group and become a hero. Search for that power within to make a difference and lets see how many heroes we can find
