  <description>This is all for my little sister, Melanie Harvey. She is 16 years old. She will be turning 17 on July 3rd. last week she was sent to the Alberta Children's Hospital in Calgary. And thats where she stays. She has been diagnosed with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia. This is all for her. She's expressed interests in wanting the world to know what she is going through. She is such a tough stubborn kid and I have to believe that she can beat this. That poor kid is a fighter and she is giving it all she's got! 

Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Its a fast-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow. In AML, the bone marrow makes many unformed cells called blasts. Blasts normally develop into white blood cells that fight infection. However, the blasts are abnormal in AML. They do not develop and cannot fight infections. The bone marrow may also make abnormal red blood cells and platelets. The number of abnormal cells (or leukemia cells) grows quickly. They crowd out the normal red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets the body needs.

I will continue to post notes per her progress. She needs our love!
