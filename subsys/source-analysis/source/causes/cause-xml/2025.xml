  <description>In 1949, the Chinese Civil War ended with the Nationalist Party's exile to the province of Taiwan, wishing to, one day, retake the mainland from the Chinese Communist Party. More than 50 years later, China continued to be separated by the Taiwan Strait.

While mainland China's second generation of leaders, led by Deng Xiaoping, began reforming the mainland, President Chiang Ching-kuo began building a strong democracy in Taiwan. Today, mainland China and Taiwan are heading towards the same unifying vision of building a strong, peaceful, and democratic nation-state.

It is time that the Chinese people let go of their differences for a strong, unified China, the way National Father Sun Yat-sen envisioned.

"The unity of the nation is the wish of all the Chinese nationals. Once the reunification is achieved, the people of China will enjoy happiness; if the reunification cannot be accomplished, they will suffer." - Dr. Sun Yat-sen

1. There is only one China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.

2. China shall be reunified under the vision of National Father Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People: Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood.

3. The cohesion of the Chinese Nation shall not be coerced, but supported by the will of the Chinese people.</description>
