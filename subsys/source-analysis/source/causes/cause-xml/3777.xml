  <description>Project Green Hands is an environmental initiative of Isha Foundation, that seeks to promote and protect biodiversity, to protect the soil, to restore lost ecological resources and increase the green cover of Tamil Nadu by 10% in the next 10 years. It seeks to plant 114 million saplings by the year 2016, entirely through voluntary participation and local community involvement. 

To this end, a mass planting marathon was held on October 17, 2006. It resulted in 852, 587 saplings being planted in 6284 locations across 27 districts in the state, by over 256,289 volunteers in just one day. Another 2.5 million plantings are planned for a single day on 2 October 2007.

The overall aim of Project Green Hands is to create public awareness of the need to protect the environment through tree planting and sustainable management. 

This ingenious plan sets a new paradigm for large scale changes, where even the poorest of the poor perform a simple action which aggregates into something colossal. The project is also a massive effort in community building, presenting a new paradigm of participatory governance that empowers lay individuals to shape the course of the world.
