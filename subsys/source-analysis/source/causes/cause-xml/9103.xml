  <description>In recent years a new kind of film has emerged: The Disposable Film. It has been made possible by new media (webcams, point and shoot digital cameras, cell phones, and one time use digital video cameras) and the rise of online distribution (YouTube, Google, MySpace, etc.). These films are often made quickly, casually, and sometimes even unintentionally.

Everyone has become a Disposable Filmmaker: directors of Saturday night cell phone videos, actors under the eyes of security cameras, and narrators before their webcams. Let's face it - we live in an age of disposable film. 

The Disposable Film Festival is an online festival with featured selections screened at a live event in December 2007. Eligible submissions are made with disposable media such as cell phones, point and shoot, webcams, and other inexpensive, readily available, non-professional flash video cameras. Pros and amateurs are welcomed to submit.

We want your Disposable Films. So, shoot 'em, cut 'em, and send them in.
