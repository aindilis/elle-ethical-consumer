  <description>One of the nation's leading animal specialty hospitals, AMC is a bastion of hope for New Yorkers invested in premium/optimized health care for their pets. 

When push comes to shove, AMC is the last word in veterinary care--at least in the NY area (although over the past several years, AMC has started to face stiff competition from 2 other newer/for profit specialty hospitals--which is why we need to step up/ignite a fundraising revival for this institution) . 

Animal Medical Center NY, indeed, caters not only to the privileged/elite New York world, but also makes widespread contributions to the 'animal' world at large. The hospital has long pioneered cutting edge treatments and has trained doctors who then go and practice throughout the country and around the world. Our contributions can make a difference in the lives/health of animals everywhere.

 Will be in touch. 

Thanks for your time and interest, Emily J. Brill
