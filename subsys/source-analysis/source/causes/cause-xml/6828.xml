  <description>The dover soccer team needs Cam Quimby.  He is proof that any fool can play for Dover, cause a good 95% of his soccer knowledge comes from the video game Fifa WC 2006.  This is ntohing against him however, since he has the highest winning percentage a DHS goalie has ever had (50%).  The problem of course is he is 1-1, but we'll ignore that.  The point of this is, well... Peer pressure always wins so i thought i'd give it a go

1. Cam Q must play soccer

2. For extra emphasis Cam Q must play soccer

3. Canada's seal hunt must end immediately (actually that was the example i thought it looked cool)</description>
