  <description>We plan social and educational events each month where families can enjoy potlucks at the beach, visit museums, parks and, of course, the zoo. We have so many members now that some of our events get pretty big. So we make a concerted effort to have enough events each year to tempt almost everyone. Our educational events happen each month with diverse topics as, "Spirituality and your family," "Advocating for your child in public schools," "Choosing Parenting," and others issues that help keep our community informed on legal, social and parenting issues.
