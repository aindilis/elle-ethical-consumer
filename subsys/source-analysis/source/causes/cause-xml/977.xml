  <description>Suited for Change is a Washington DC based charity that provides professional clothing and career coaching to low-income women who have completed job training and/or job readiness programs and are seeking employment. Suited for Change also provides professional clothing when the candidate successfully lands a job. You have to have something to wear to work, too!

For just $49 you enable Suited for Change to buy a professional suit that a woman would wear to a job interview.

Will you help me raise enough money to buy 10 suits?

1. Looking professional at a job interview can make all the difference.

2. If no one ever helps you prepare for a job interview, how would you know how to act or look?</description>
