Schwannomatosis is a devastating disorder affecting 1 in 40,000 individuals.  It has only recently been diagnosed, so little is known about its causes and treatments.  We are funding a research effort with The Children's Tumor Foundation to try and cure this excruciatingly painful disorder.  To get the full story go to www.tumornators.com &amp; www.ctf.org .
