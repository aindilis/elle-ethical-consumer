  <description>America: What Are We?
We Are The People and We Want Our Country Back!
In recent years, we have lost control of our government.  Presently, whenever there is a choice between corporate profit or the health and welfare of its citizenry, the US government picks profits.
Whether it is outright subsidy or indirect corporate profit from allowing our resources to be exploited and our air and water poluted, we have become expendable. 
That will only end when WE THE PEOPLE decide that enough is enough.

1. The People come first

2. Corporate power is corrupting democracy

3. The Government must respond to its citizens</description>
