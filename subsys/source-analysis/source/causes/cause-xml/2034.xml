  <description>The House Organic Caucus is a body set up to safeguard strict organic standards and promote organic agriculture. We want representatives from every state to join the Caucus.

Ohio Representative Dennis Kucinich's House Bill (formerly HB#2916) restores consumer choice by requiring food companies to label all foods containing GE ingredients. In Europe, mandatory labeling laws have basically driven GE foods off the market. We want all GE foods labeled.

The next Farm Bill should sharply increase subsidies for organic or sustainable farming practices and renewable energy,while reducing or eliminating subsidies for chemical-intensive or GE crops, starting with cotton. Congress currently gives $20-30 billion in annual taxpayer subsidies to conventional and biotech farm crops, while allocating $5 million or less to organic agriculture.

The OCA works on many issues of health, justice and sustainability, including preserving and protecting organic standards and relocalizing the economy.
