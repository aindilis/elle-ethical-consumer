  <description>I feel that there` isn`t enough disabled people in the workforce today especially in our smaller communities !  I think the employers should have more training on disabilies and not be ignorant just because the employer see`s someone with a disabilty , they should not judge one`s abilty just because of how they look !

1. Canada`s employer`s must look through disability`s!</description>
