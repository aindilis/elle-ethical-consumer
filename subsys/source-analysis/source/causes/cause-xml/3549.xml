  <description>Athletes Helping Athletes provides handcycles and other "adaptive sports equipment" to the disabled, especially children, so that they can participate in physical activities.  The organization also provides grants to "(a) send children with disabilities to adaptive sports camps, (b) pay for training services for challenged athletes, and (c) cover event entry fees, travel costs, and other expenses relating to participation by disabled athletes in athletic events."

Handcycles cost up to $3,000, making them quite costly for families already paying a lot for medical care for their disabled child.  

More information is available at the website http://www.athleteshelpingathletes.org and also at http://www.roadrunnersports.com


1. Give disabled children a feeling of empowerment and self-esteem to overcome their disabilities

2. Encourage everyone to be physically active despite their impairments

3. Every family should be able to afford sports equipment for their children</description>
