  <description>Pathways Animal Assisted Therapy, Inc. is a non-profit organization helping others through interaction with animals. Our mission is to improve the lives of those in need through the human-animal bond. Currently, our main focus is our horse programs, but we hope to expand to programs using other animals as we grow. 

Pathways provides programs for people with physical and cognitive disorders, as well as those with social, emotional or behavioral issues. We also provide programs for students at risk in their environment and educational programs for those interested in learning more about horses. 

1. The opportunity to work with a horse builds physical strength, improves motor skills, focusing and sequencing abilities and increases self-confidence. </description>
