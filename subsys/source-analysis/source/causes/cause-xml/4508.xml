  <description>Sanctuary for Families envisions a society in which freedom from domestic violence is a basic human right. We are dedicated to the safety, healing, and self-sufficiency of battered women and their children. In the past year alone we have provided direct services to over 8,000 women and children. 

Sanctuary has 125 full-time and 18 part-time staff working out of eight office and shelter locations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. Through active recruitment of bilingual and bicultural staff, Sanctuary is able to offer services to clients in 28 languages; many more languages are represented by our hundreds of pro bono attorneys and volunteers.
