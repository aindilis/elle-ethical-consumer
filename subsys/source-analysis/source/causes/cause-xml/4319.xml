  <description>As mystical mines become heavily uncommon, many Dwarves are now without a home. Dwarves are falling prey to once allies, the Gnomes who are in dire need for experience points in the War of Three Hammers. Please help these innocent creatures, without them, where will Santa outsource to during Christmas, because the Elves don't do shit. Though this may seem a world away, the World of Warcraft sits in every Costco in America.

1. This isn't mocking anyone or making fun of a dire situation, it's providing comic relief for a world that needs it.

2. The War of Three Hammres must end.

3. Dwarves and Gnomes must renew their pact against Orcs.

4. Elves have stupid ears.

5. I need to go get some samples at Costco.</description>
