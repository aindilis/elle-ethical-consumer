  <description>To motivate people to recycle more and to make it easier for people to recycle, as well as making the world a better place for generations to come. This is an all around support group who will help to provide solutions for the major problems of today. 

1. There are ways to do it, some people just need help doing it. 

2. With the proper funding and help, we can recycle more and make a larger impact. 

3. Our world is wasting away, and if we don't help to stop, or slow down the process, there will be nothing left. </description>
