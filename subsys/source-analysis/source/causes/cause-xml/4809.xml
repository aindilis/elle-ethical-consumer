  <description>This year R-rated Horror films like "Grind House" and "Hostel:Part II" have been making only a few millions and have been passing theathers in a couple of weeks.This means we Horror fans may loose our R-rated Horror films because studios are going to think people aren't into R-rated Horror films anymore so we will see more PG-13 Horror films.We may loose this genre If we don't act now!
