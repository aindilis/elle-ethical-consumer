  <description>Baby Kaleb was born November 27, 2006. After a day at the sitters May 2007, Kristy noticed something was not right. Kaleb was unresponsive in ICU as the result of SBS (Shaken Baby Syndrome).  His head swelled due to bleeding of the brain. Kaleb had to have a tube placed in his brain to drain the fluid. But no matter what the doctors said Kristy would not believe them... she believed in miracles.. Kaleb is a miracle.. He is at home now under the care of his loving family. He can see light and dark, but the doctors will need to do more tests to find out what else he can see.... He is growing so much. Please pray for Kaleb and his family.  


Kaleb is one of many babies and small children that have been shaken. It has to stop. Dont abuse the innocent. They do nothing wrong. If a baby has had their needs met and are still crying, walk away, get fresh air, but NEVER shake a baby!

1. You should never shake a baby

2. Shaking an infant can cause major damage

3. There should not be a bail high enough for someone who chooses to harm a child</description>
