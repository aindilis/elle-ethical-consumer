  <description>Pittsburgh PA, summer 2006.

At a pre-college bonding night, Stephanie Alman (Boca Reton, Florida) and Katherine Bourne (Bothell, Washington) found that they not only shared a love a of theatre, eating and insane roomates, they discovered they had the same birthday. Coincidence? We think not. It soon became apparant to all who knew them that this was no "normal" summer friendship. Sadly, after 6 glorious weeks of practicing monologues, buying yoga classes they almost never took and hiding in closets, they were seperated until only-God-knows-when. Since that fateful day, they have spoken at least twice every week, sharing stories of love lost, friendships found and insane phone messages. They must come together again. This can only happen with your support. Support the Cause! Reunite Katherine and Stephanie!!!!

1. Katherine and Stephanie must be reunited before it is too late

2. They should have been roomates at CMU

3. Plane tickets across the country are too darn expensive for us to buy on our own</description>
