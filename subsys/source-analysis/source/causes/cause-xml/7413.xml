  <description>A recent ruling by the Copyright Royalty Board has dramatically increased the fees internet radio companies must pay to play the music you enjoy and threatens the future of internet radio. You can help, let your voice be heard.  We need to petition congress to pass the bill that will make these royalty fees equal to that of commercial radio and help keep the diversity of net radio as well as the underground music scene alive.  Do not donate, i just needed an organization to claim so i could create this cause.   SAVE NET RADIO!
