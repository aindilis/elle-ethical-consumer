  <description>"We are a group of passionate people dedicated to ending cruelty by saving the lives of abandoned cats and kittens in the Marco Island community."

Last year we rescued and adopted 181kittens and cats with an average cost of over $100.00 each. We also TNR'd (trap, nueter, return) an additional 79 adult cats who live in protected colonies with daily caregiving.

Together we can ensure that every homeless kitten is rescued and adopted into a loving home.

You can help by giving a donation today.

Thank you so much!

1. Rescue and offer relief to all homeless/feral cats in SW Florida.

2. Promote and offer affordable and free spay/neuter to prevent further homeless animals in the area.

3. Eventually, we hope to coordinate a low low cost or free spay/neuter program.

4. Expand regionally and nationally. </description>
