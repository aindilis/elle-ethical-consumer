  <description>ALS is a fatal, neuromuscular disease, which attacks the motor neurons making even the simplest movements of walking, speaking and gesturing impossible. Ultimately the body becomes paralyzed, yet through it all, the mind remains unaffected.

I am walking in memory of Kevi Mallios, who lost her courageous battle with this horrid disease. During her two-year struggle with the debilitating effects of ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), Kevi forever inspired us with her bravery and determination. It is this inspiration that leads me to continue the fight against ALS in her memory, knowing that we have the ability to help others with ALS.
