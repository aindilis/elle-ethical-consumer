  <description>FSMism is a theory of Intelligent Design that is an alternative to the theory of evolution. It is backed by scientific evidence (i.e., faith) and is logically consistent. It explains a wide variety of phenomena such as natural disasters, which occur because of the drop in the number of pirates, gravity (Intelligent Falling), which is a result of His Noodly Appendage pushing us onto the Earth, and why things like radiometric dating are wrong, which is because, when measured by Evil Scientists, the results of the measurements are changed by the FSM using His Noodly Appendage so that He can fool us into thinking the Earth is older than it really is.

Remember, God exists and he tastes like pasta.
RAmen.

1. Evolution and ID (Creationism, FSMism, and others) should be given equal time in science classrooms.

2. Science is not the methodological study of the natural. It's the "study" of all possible explanations for a given phenomena.

3. Criticism of this theory is not allowed, but the FSM will not smite you for breaking this rule, unlike some *other* deities.</description>
