  <description>As everyone knows....the Ottowa Senators were recently in the Stanley Cup Finals and lets say there overall play was rather gay. They are an unentertaining team who does not score highlight goals like there rivals. There best goals was a pass off of Phillips stick in game 5 that found its way behind Ray Emory to give the Ducks a clear victory. There gayest goal was a "Pele" worthy goal by the captian Daniel Alfredsson. "Pele" also pulled the biggest asshole move of the playoffs after he took a direct shot at Scott Neidermyer at the end of the second period.
