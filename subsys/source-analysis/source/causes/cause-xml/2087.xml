  <description>Religion can be a great thing. It can guide you through hard times and play a very large role in your life, but I found it amazing that if I searched causes for 'freedom of religion' and 'accept religion' I couldn't find one single group that just preached all out accpetance of all religions! This cause is for people who believe that everyone has a right to believe in whatever they want to believe in and they won't go to hell for it or anything. This cause encourages people to be different and believe in what ever they believe and let others do the same.

1. Everyone has a right to believe in any religion they wish to believe in

2. Everyone has a right to worship...or not to

3. Everyone should none the less accept that others may believe in different things and thats OK

4. No one should be punished for believing in what they believe in and no one is going to be punished by some supernatural force or divine power (watever u may or may not believe in) because they believe something different than you do

5. Freedom of Religion

6. See statement, use your common sense, its basically point 5</description>
