  <description>If you're like me, you cherish life. You nurture it. Thats why people like me decide to take a stand and save those poor, starving, AIDS-ridden babies and small children in Africa, so they can spread their scourge throughout the world. If you're a humanitarian, its obvious whos side you're on. Don't be a heartless bastard, join the cause.
