  <description>Anyone who knows of Chiyo-chan would agree that she we would make a great president.  She's nice to everyone, but can lay down the law if she has to.  She's also very big on resolving conflicts when they arise.

Cuteness in our country would improve by leaps and bounds.

As for qualifications, she's a child prodigy who moved to America in her early teens to go to college.  By election time she'll even have her US citizenship.

Her current running mate candidate is Mr. Itadakichi.

1. Improvement of Love and Peace in America is essential

2. Cuteness must improve in the US

3. US Citizen, ShmUS Citizen</description>
