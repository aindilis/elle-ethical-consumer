  <description>This cause aims to unite people who believe that we are being ripped off for a basic human right - communication!

South Africa has the highest cellphone call rates in the world - we want that to change.

For a developing country, this seriously limits economic growth and takes advantage of those who cannot even afford education and housing - let alone have the freedom to communicate with each other and prospective employers.

Our businesses suffer from a gross lack of reliable, fast and reasonably priced bandwidth/internet connections.

The monopoly of Telkom must end and so too must the absurd profits being posted by the mobile network providers that be!

Yebo Gogo! Come C for yourself - wave hello to free communication. It is a possibility - every where you go!
