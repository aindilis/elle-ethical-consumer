  <description>We want to take the money out of politics plain and simple.  We believe that privately funded campaigns have led to corruption, cronyism, and it has kept good people from being able to run for office.  Anybody should be able to run for office, regardless of how much money they have.  Today, our system is more about how much a candidate can raise rather then what are their ideas.  Politics at it's best, is a battle between two good people over the issues that matter to the people.  Taking money out of politics would make government more open and honest and put the people back in charge.  

1. End corruption in America's government.

2. Let all good people run for office.

3. Give the power back to the people. 

4. Making politcs a battle of ideas again.

5. Making the system work for people again.</description>
