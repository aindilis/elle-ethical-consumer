  <description>I myself have OCD and have been to at least 9 therapist and doctors over the past 4 years and have yet to find a cure. I know how frustrating and terrifing it can be.

"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a neuro-biological disorder. Fears, phobias, and rituals triggered by OCD can devastate a person's life. Related disorders frequently coexist with OCD, including depression, anxiety disorders, Tourette's Syndrome, and Attention Deficit Disorder. OCD is sometimes accompanied by depression, eating disorders, substance abuse, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or other anxiety disorders.
The NIMH survey showed that OCD affects more than 2 percent of the population, meaning that OCD is more common than such severe mental illnesses as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or panic disorder."

Anyways, there's the jist.
