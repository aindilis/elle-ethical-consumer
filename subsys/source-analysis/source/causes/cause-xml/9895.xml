  <description>At Hot Topic and Torrid, we believe music and the arts make everyone&#8217;s life a whole lot better, so we&#8217;ve decided to enrich kids&#8217; lives by enabling them to express themselves musically and artistically!

The Hot Topic Foundation aims to support programs and organizations that specifically focus on encouraging and educating youth in music, creative writing, painting, photography, filmmaking and more. Besides, what kid wouldn&#8217;t want the chance to wail on a trombone, bang on some drums or paint a masterpiece?

The stuff is selling in stores and online, and 100% of the proceeds go directly to the Hot Topic Foundation. The pins, bracelets, mints and key chains are available in two styles: Music = Life&#8482; and Rock The Arts&#8482;. They're only a buck, too!

Also, feast your ears on the Hopeless/Sub City Records Metal = Life&#8482; CD/DVDs! Turn up songs and videos from Avenged Sevenfold, As I Lay Dying, Between the Buried And Me and tons more. Proceeds from these releases also go right to the Hot Topic Foundation. Bang your head for a good cause today!
