  <description>If you would like to help the homeless people of Sacramento, CA please join this group.  Donate or volunteer your time to help Loaves and Fishes.  There is an organization within Loaves and Fishes that I particularly want to concentrate on called Mustard Seed.  It is a school that homeless children can go to and get food and shelter along with their education.
