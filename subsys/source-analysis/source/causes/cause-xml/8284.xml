  <description>Pro-Life means that you are bringing an unwanted child into the world. That diminishes the child's life. God would not choose nor want someone to have a worse off chance in life just because a man and a woman made a very common understandable mistake. We all make mistakes....you people are Christian, I thought you were supposed to be all about forgiveness.

1. enlighten the ignorant

2. try to handle their verbal spat violence

3. abortions, abortions, abortions</description>
