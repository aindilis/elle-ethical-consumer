  <description> The Weekend to End Breast Cancer is a two-day, 60-kilometre walk through the neighbourhoods of Toronto, Ontario, CANADA. 

It will be held September 7th - 9th 2007

Proceeds benefit Princess Margaret Hospital, funding important breast cancer research, education, services and care.

This walk is for all those who know someone that has breast cancer and has either survived or not! 

This walk is for my family and friends who have all been affected by breast cancer in one way or another. 

For my two aunts who are breast cancer survivors, and for a very close family friend who didn't survive. I dedicate this walk for the cure to them!

So please help me in my goal and help fight for a cure against breast cancer, may you and your family never be affected by this disease.
