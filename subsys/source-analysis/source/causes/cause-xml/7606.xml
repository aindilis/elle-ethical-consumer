  <description>Im starting this cause for me,Ash and anyone who has battled an  opiate addiction or has a loved one fighting an opiate addiction. I've been clean from opiates for one year and I now  have the chance to raise awareness about this terrible disease that affects so many people. Please help me fight this battle!!!!!!


1. Awareness needs to be raised about drug abuse. 

2. More resources are needed for addicts who need to detox and/or go to rehab.</description>
