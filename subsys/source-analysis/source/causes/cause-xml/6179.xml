  <description>The path from research discovery to the creation of a new treatment is often an extremely long one. The average time for the development of a new central nervous system treatment is currently 13 years.

The Michael J. Fox Foundation is helping to speed up drug development for PD with innovative strategies that identify roadblocks along the therapeutic development pipeline. By sharing the risk of drug development with academic and industry researchers alike, we hope to increase the movement of new treatments into the clinic.

The Michael J. Fox Foundation is dedicated to helping develop better treatments for Parkinson's patients and, ultimately, curing the disease. That's why we work to identify and quickly fund the research with the best chance of leading to new treatments.
