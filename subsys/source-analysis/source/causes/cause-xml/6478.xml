  <description>We raise money to purchase the contents in The Big Fun Box, that&#8217;s filled with fun, creative activities. The Big Fun Boxes are then donated to hospitalized children around the country. They're given to children who have been in the hospital for several days and expect to be in for several more. We want to give them a way to get their minds off of being sick or injured and/or stressed, bored and scared.

1. If laughter is the best medicine, having "Big Fun" is important in the healing process.

2. Making fun contagious is the spreading of the "Big Fun" spirit to hospitalized children and their families.

3. We want to donate Big Fun Boxes to at least 50,000 hospitalized children every year.</description>
