  <description>The Owens Foundation for Wildlife Conservation was established in 1986 by American Zoologists, Dr. Delia and Mark Owens who spent 23 years conducting wildlife research and conservation programs in Africa (Botswana and Zambia) and now are working in the NW US supporting grizzly bear conservation. The OFWC exists to support the Owens' field research and conservation of threatened and endangered species and to encourage and assist qualified field research scientists. We design our programs to create sustainability between human and wildlife populations so that both groups benefit from one another. Education is also a mandate of the OFWC.
