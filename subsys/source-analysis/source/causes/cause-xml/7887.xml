  <description>The World Family Ethiopian Orphans and Medical Care

The World Family is developing a sustainable, nonreligious, community-based program to support orphans and their extended families in Gara Dima, in the East Showa Region of Ethiopia. The People of Gara Dima live with contaminated water, malaria, AIDS and other preventable diseases. We plan to build a community center, offering community education, vocational training, and a small farm with crops and livestock to teach the orphans self reliance.

Most of the rural health facilities in Ethiopia are unable to deliver proper medical care due to lack of basic medical instruments, equipment, and supplies. The facilities are virtually empty, lacking most of the basic equipment.  We work in collaboration with the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health, Clinton HIV/AIDS Rural Initiative and other partners. We seek donations from U.S. medical care facilities and ship the equipment to hospitals and clinics in Ethiopia. 

1. By improving the health care system in Ethiopia, we can save lives.

2. When we save the lives and improve the health of parents, we prevent children from becoming orphans.

3. We can help Ethiopian orphans with food, education, and medical care without removing them from their communities.</description>
