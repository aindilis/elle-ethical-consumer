  <description>SAVE (Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments) is a 
is a non-profit community-based organization founded in 1976 to address the needs of people experiencing family violence and is funded by federal, state and local jurisdictions, private foundations, corporations, and concerned individuals. (take from website: www.save-dv.org) --&gt; Please visit their site for more on the organization.


A group of youth from St. Anne's Catholic Parish is  collaborating together to host a dance marathon to benefit SAVE and support their effort against domestic violence. 

The concept is very similar to a walk-a-thon or a jump rope-a-thon where sponsored participants will try to dance for as long they can, non-stop, for up to 5 hours.

There'll also be Prizes, Pizza, Performances, and MORE!!! 

ANYONE between the ages of 14-25 can attend. The cause is universal and ALL are WELCOME even for those who don't wish to actually participate in the marathon. 

If you are keen on just going to the dance without raising money, it is $7 presale up to August 3rd and $10 at the door, thereafter. No fees for participants with sponsors/pledges.

Registration Forms and Pledge Logs are available to prospective participants by request. Please e-mail:
