  <description>Each year a disease that has virtually been eliminated in the Western Hemisphere kills nearly 345,000 people globally, and of those, most are children under the age of five. Measles is a leading vaccine-preventable childhood killer and millions of children still remain at risk. There is good news. Measles can be prevented with a simple vaccination that costs less than one dollar per child. 

The Measles Initiative, launched in 2001, is a partnership committed to reducing measles deaths globally, supporting the goal of cutting measles deaths by 90 percent by 2010 compared with estimates from 2000. During 2000-2005 more than 360 million children were vaccinated globally. During its first five years (2001-2005), the Initiative was the main international supporter of mass measles immunization campaigns that led to the vaccination of more than 217 million children, predominantly in Africa.
