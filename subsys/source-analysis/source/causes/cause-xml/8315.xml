  <description>Ask cosmetics companies to offer the option of products for sale WITHOUT the packaging at a reduced price. They look good because they are doing something to address environmental concerns and making a REAL effort to reduce plastic and paper consumption and waste. We don't need to feel bad about putting more junk into bins at home and then into the environment. We really don't need the boxes, plastic, packaging waste that comes with almsot every cosmetic and make-up purchase.

1. Reduce polution and waste.

2. Raise packaging reduction awareness.

3. Cosmetics companies work with us, their consumer.</description>
