  <description>one out of ten pedophiles released after already raping a child and ruining sex for them then goes and does it again. It is abhorrent that a society concerned with human rights would allow such a situation. Letting pedophiles out of jail is a Holocaust. Not six million MEN and WOMEN and children...no, just hundreds of millions of children, getting raped. Welcome to our world. If you already raped a child why do you deserve to get out? You don't. One out of ten does it again, that is unacceptable. 

IN THE BALANCE: a second chance for nine men who raped a child vs. a child getting raped.

If you choose let them out, then you choose raping children. 

1. try to get it through to sick people who secretly want rape in the world that things have to change

2. try to get it through to them

3. try to get it through, it's all the few good people on Earth can do</description>
