  <description>What We Do

First Book provides new books to children in need addressing one of the most important factors affecting illiteracy &#8211; access to books.

How We Do It

First Book has&#160;distributed more than 70 million new books to programs that serve children from low-income families through a growing network of programs, organizations, and schools.  

Our publishing partners such as Random House, Simon &amp; Schuster, and others, donate books to give to these programs.  

Corporate and individual donors support and help us continue doing this important work.

First Book&#8217;s business model is designed for maximum efficiency. Non-programmatic costs total less than 3% of revenue. As a result, every $1 donation to First Book results in $10 worth of new books directly into the hands of children in need.

How You Can Help

1. Donate as little as $2.00 to give one brand new book that will introduce the joy of reading to a first-time reader.

2. Recruit more friends to join our cause!
