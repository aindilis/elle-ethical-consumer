  <description>Abusing animals is one of the lowest things you could ever do. Animals are often times made defenseless to their attackers through confinement, defanging, or the use of a deadly weapon.  Please show your support to end the abuse of animals!

The dog in the picture's name is Daisy &amp; this is her story:
She was doused with gasoline and set on fire. Most severe (2nd and 3rd degree) burns were on the dog's belly, legs and eyelids. Vets put Daisy's chance of survival at 50% if blood infection or kidney failure did not occur. Daisy made a remarkable recovery and has been adopted!  There were so many donations from animal lovers like you that made her recovery a success!  

Please keep in mind that animal abuse occurs every day and your continued support is needed to help animals like Daisy.
