  <description>Professionals for Adult Literacy is a program that seeks to engage progressive leaders in discussions of community empowerment, championing the life-changing benefits of literacy for adults and their families. We are a diverse group of individuals from the fields of education, social services, economic development, and public policy. PAL provides an exciting opportunity to interact with like-minded individuals and gives professionals from all walks of life a unique forum in which to learn more about current issues in literacy and their impact on social progress.

1. We believe that the ability to read and write, to understand and be understood is critical to personal freedom and the maintenance of a democratic society.

2. We are committed to discovering new ways of harnessing society's existing resources for the achievement of literacy.

3. We strive to work in harmony and collaboration with respect and understanding.</description>
