  <description>One Charity. One Problem. One Goal.

It just might be the most effective, impactful donation to a charity you ever make!

100% of your donation will go towards programs that help children, 0% will go to overhead. 

The free cleft surgery your donation will help provide, is a true, modern-day medical miracle: it costs as little as $250 and takes as little as 45 minutes. 

That's all it takes to give a desperate child not just a new smile, but a new life. 

When you see the impact your donation has, you'll end up smiling too. 

1. Focused on single problem: cleft lip and palate

2. 100% of your donations used for programs
