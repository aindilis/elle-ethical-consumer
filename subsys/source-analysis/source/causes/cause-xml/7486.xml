  <description>The principle of "Informed Consent" is at the foundation of Canadian Medical Law; it grants every citizen the right to reject invasive medical procedures that may carry unacceptable risks&#8212;we believe vaccination is such a procedure. When considering vaccination, we urge you to base your decision on information rather than assumption; please complete your own research before subjecting your child and make a truly informed decision!



1. Vaccinations should be a CHOICE!!!

2. Vaccinations should have a list of ingredients.

3. Vaccination Risks should be made public....very public.</description>
