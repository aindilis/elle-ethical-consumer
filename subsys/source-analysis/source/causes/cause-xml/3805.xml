  <description> the message that this group sends 2 all Palestinian gun men is to stop this frivolous attacks on each other &amp; start 2 solve this situation in peaceful ways...
Your just killing more Palestinians than you are killing each other, &amp; look at the world around you, they see you as kids who didn't pass their 2 year &amp; start to think...
Israel didn't dare to do to you what you are doing to each other, now you want to prove to them that they were right in starting a war against you?...
&amp; why so much that you want to rule Gaza Hamas?, so that you can destroy the dream of istablishing the Palestinian country &amp; keep on fighting?
In other words, let's be hand-in-hand &amp; show the world that we deserve to live as they do &amp; enjoy what's left in our lives... 

1. Hamas &amp; Fatah has to stop now!!!</description>
