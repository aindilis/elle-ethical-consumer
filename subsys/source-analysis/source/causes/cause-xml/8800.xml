  <description>To create awareness and educate A.B.O.U.T. our chosen sport and our passions as well as set up a ride for and A.B.O.U.T. our future awareness.

What I mean A.B.O.U.T this, we should all gather and ride for the future............


THE CHILDREN. 

Donate and organize a ride for the SICK KIDS HOSPITAL, with out them, our goals once as children end with us.

It's A.B.O.U.T. time we care! 


If you care about our future and wish to help out, join the club.

I am in the works with several huge organizations, to make this happen. While it's not going to be this year, it will be next year!!

Support the cause, it's A.B.O.U.T TIME WE CARE!!!


1. Our future as riders depends on the children, without them, our future ends now!!</description>
