  <description>Our mission is to promote the Standardbred breed as a wonderful pleasure horse in their lives after racing through the setup of more SPHO Branches.

1. Standardbreds can live a full and productive life after racing.

2. They can be pleasure ridden or driven.

3. Despite what people say, they CAN compete sucessfully in Dressage and Jumping, and most CAN canter!</description>
