  <description>Global warming has caused our average temperature to grow by 0.8 degrees celcius since 1880s. This is averaging an increase of 0.006 degrees per year. We deem this unacceptable. At this rate, a mellenium will have to pass before our winters go from horribly cold to moderately annoying.

We believe this was caused by poor coordination and lack of commitment by many nations. Together, by small individual actions, we have the power to bring these numbers up, we have the power to make a difference.

Why should only future generations take advantage of the examplary efforts and hard work displayed throughout the 20th century? We deserve results and we want them now!

Join our cause and perhaps, soon, we'll export canadian coconuts.
