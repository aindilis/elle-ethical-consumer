  <description>Everybody deserves the right to live. Ending a pregnancy because you don't want to be responsible for another life or you don't have the money to support a child is unacceptable. 

Sometimes when young or unwed girls become pregnant, they have nowhere to go. This group supports and applauds the young women who choose to give life to their babies, even if it means being kicked out of their homes. 

Money donated to this cause will go to My Father's House, which is an entirely privately-funded home in Chelmsford, MA for unwed mothers. 

I researched "Project Agape," which is the organization that set up "causes." The processing fee for donations is 4.5%, which means that for every dollar that you donate, My Father's House will recieve 96.5 cents. If you'd rather send money directly, their address is

83 Middlesex Street
North Chelmsford, MA
