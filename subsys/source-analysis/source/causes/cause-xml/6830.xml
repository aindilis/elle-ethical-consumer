  <description>Poverty is extremely common in third world countires, specifically Africa. 315 million African people or about half of the African population survive on less than $1 a day. 33% of the population suffer from malnutrition. Less than half of the African population can go and see a dentist, doctor or hospital. The life expectancy in Africa is 41 years. Only 57% of the African population is in school. Of that percentage, only 2/3 continue to higher education. One person out of five has electricity, one person in fifteen has a phone line and .78 people out of 100 surf the internet (you are lucky). Poverty in the world is extremely bad, too. 1.2 billion out of the 6 billion on Earth do not have safe drinking water...because of this over 2.2 million people die every year from polluted water. In the 90's, the governments help to these countries dropped from .33% to .22% of our budget. THe target range for this is .7%. On the UN's top 111 quality of life list, the U.S. ranked 13. Less than ten of about the 60 African countries made that list..........
