  <description>I swim, pedal and run. You donate. Everyone wins. See? It's that easy.

Your donations go to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to fund blood cancer research. Together, we can get one step closer to the real finish line - a cure.

Donate here, or through my official fundraising website: http://www.active.com/donate/tntsofl/francisco

You can either plunk down some cash, or sponsor my training (ie pledge a certain amount per lap I swim, mile I bike or kilometer I run). Or you can set milestones for me and pay x amount if I beat a particular time or something during training. 

Spread the word!
