  <description>Every year from September through April, fishermen in Japan hunt and kill
about 20,000 dolphins and other whales in the most brutal way imaginable. This
is the largest massacre of dolphins anywhere in the world. The fishermen say
they kill the dolphins primarily as a form of "pest control." They say the
dolphins eat too many fish, and that they are simply eradicating the
competition. We need to let them know that these crimes against nature are
unacceptable to the rest of the world. Help us send a powerful message to the
Japanese dolphin hunters and their government: STOP THE DOLPHIN SLAUGHTER.

Also,live dolphins live in water for about 45 years,but if captured,they live only for about 5 years.
