  <description>Our goal is to get Liliane Sar-Graycar the necessary funds to be able to attend Sarah Lawrence College in Fall 2007.

Do not make any donations on FaceBook. If you do it only goes to Sarah Lawrence, and not to help me pay for my tuition.

I'll find a way so that everyone can donate, but right now it's not available.

Just help by showing your support!

If you don't know the details behind the cause... well, I'll be putting up more accessible info when I can.

Right now I'm busy trying to figure out what I'm going to do.

Any info can be passed on by word of mouth!

Thanks everyone!

1. She deserves the right to an education that she worked for.

2. The situation is unfair.</description>
