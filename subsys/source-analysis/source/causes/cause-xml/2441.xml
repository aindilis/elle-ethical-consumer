  <description>We are two high school students, Elinor Paulus and Abigail Jarret, from Seattle.  We believe in community control of water resources worldwide!  Water is a basic human right.  Buying bottled water supports the elimination of people's water in third world countries, esp. India.  We also believe in art to change the world, which is a component of our project.  We are holding social and political art workshops and will create awareness of the serious water issues through such art forms.  Join our cause!  PLEASE ask us about it.  We want to spread awareness!  
"If the wars of this century were fought over oil, the wars of the next century will be fought over water."
-Ismail Serageldin, Vice President of the World Bank
