  <description>I'm fed up with the whole republicans and democrats thing, so i'm starting a cause for people that just wanna be conservative, but have no affiliation with a political party!

1. Conservatives Rule!

2. Our first Founding Father (Washington) warned us not to get separated into political parties, so lets not.

3. Just keep the government the way it is and let the people vote be heard.

4. Respect the Constitution

5. Ohh Yea!</description>
