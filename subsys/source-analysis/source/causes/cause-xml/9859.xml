  <description>It is sad that African American people are the minority population in the U.S. but we are the majority with this disease. It is time to change our lifestyles and stop being ignorant and ignoring our common sense. Abstinence is a good thing and promiscuity is not.

It is also important to talk with people who actually have it.
Some have been infected because of a parent or have been victimized. So show some compassion and don't alienate anyone who is living with the disease.

1. Promote abstinence

2. Educate

3. Show compassion to HIV/AIDS patients</description>
