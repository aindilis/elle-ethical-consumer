  <description>PTE&#8217;s mission is to research, design and implement effective models of HIV/AIDS education for Chinese schools.  Working with local partners and government institutions, PTE catalyzes change by delivering HIV/AIDS education resources and support to China&#8217;s existing school infrastructure and programs. 

China&#8217;s HIV infections are growing at yearly rate of 30%.  It has a booming economy, an increasingly mobile population and 1.3 billion citizens who are dangerously uninformed about HIV/AIDS.  Incorporating HIV/AIDS education into schools will help avert a generalized epidemic, decrease rates of infection and ensure those already infected live in a society that is understanding and tolerant towards them.

1. In the absence of a cure, education is the most effective tool in the prevention of the HIV virus.  

2. Education will increase understanding, reduce discrimination and increase the amount of people being tested and receiving treatment.

3. Reducing discrimination and stigma is the key to slowing the spread of the HIV virus.</description>
