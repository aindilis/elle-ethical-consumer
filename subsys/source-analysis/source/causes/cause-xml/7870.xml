  <description>Too many students and people across the country are turning to stimulants to deal with depression, other mental health issues, or simply to keep up with an increasingly fast paced world. Often times undiagnosed depression can be at the root of stimulant addiction. Through mature fellowship and community of former addicts, we can help those who simply cannot slow it down on their own. 

1. Provide fellowship and encouragement for recovering cocaine and stimulant addicts

2. Decrease the stigma for getting help for depression, mental health issues, and addiction.

3. Encouraging a decrease in spending on the War On Drugs in favor of increased education and rehab facilities. Prisons are no place to detox.</description>
