  <description>Compassionate Action for Animals works to reduce the suffering of farmed animals through outreach and education such as distributing leaflets, cable access shows, vegan food giveaways, and speakers. To build a community of people concerned about animal rights, we host vegetarian potlucks, dine-outs, and social events in Minneapolis and St. Paul.
