  <description>We achieve our mission by recruiting student leaders across the nation to develop FACE AIDS chapters to engage their campuses. These chapters organize events such as speaker panels, debates, film screenings, charity sports tournaments, and education campaigns to raise awareness and funds on their campuses.

A core activity of each chapter is the distribution of beaded AIDS awareness pins made by men and women affected by AIDS in Zambia. This way, by buying and wearing a pin, students are expressing their solidarity not only with this BIG disease but with an actual man or woman directly affected by AIDS in Africa. Every time a student looks at the FACE AIDS pin on his or her backpack, jeans, or t-shirt, he sees not just an anonymous issue, he sees the faces and stories of people like Priscilla Chipasha, Rosemary Chilufya, and George Musonda. He sees that AIDS is a human issue, a personal issue, and we believe this will make him feel compelled to act.

FACE AIDS donates all the money raised through these campus campaigns to Partners in Health, a social justice health care organization widely recognized as one of the best groups addressing HIV in the developing world.

1. People dying from a preventable and treatable disease is unacceptable.

2. Students can and should play a role in the fight against AIDS in Africa.

3. A student movement will lead this fight.</description>
