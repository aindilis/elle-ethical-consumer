  <description>Working with a diverse coalition of artists, music industry executives, mental health advocates and youth leaders, mpower is dedicated to reaching out to today's youth about a range of mental health issues, including depression, substance abuse, anxiety, eating disorders and suicide, and providing important resources and information to encourage those in need to seek help.

Sponsored by the National Mental Health Association (NMHA), one of the country's top health charities, and its 340 affiliates nationwide, mpower will turn up the volume nationally and locally through concert tie-ins, special events, media activities, PSAs, educational forums and web-based outreach and empower millions of young people to get informed and take action.
