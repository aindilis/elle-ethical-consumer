  <description>One day I was driving to a place I haven't been to in about three years, and what I saw dissapointed me ALOT...The once green and lush forests were all RED AND RUST COLORED! I was shocked that something like that could happen so quickly! Like...Three years ago there was ZERO trees that were taken by the Pine Beetle...Now the whole areas totally distroyed! Help try to find a stop to the spread of the Pine Beetle.

1. What's going to happen when there's no trees? No trees, no oxygen. Also--Remember your favorite camping spot? Imagine going there with no trees, no wildlife, nothing. Trees are our everything.</description>
