  <description>There are no other "self injury" causes, and this isn't really a cause. This is more just a thing to help raise awareness, because a lot of people actually do self mutilate whether you want to aknowledge it or not. 
1/130 people self injure, and it's on the rise. More information at www.selfharm.org.

aKa:: The more members the more people know about this :)
