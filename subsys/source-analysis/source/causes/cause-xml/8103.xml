  <description>This cause has been created in the first place to make Egyptian women aware of their rights to an equal society, should it be on the levels of politics, gender and family. 

In the second place, buy joining this cause you truly believe that a change in mentalities can be made and that this change mainly comes from the egyptian society itself, more than from the help of organizations. 

Finally, this cause sustain the fact that ancestral customs and traditions are not related to religion, and that some customs and traditions should be stopped for the health and humanity of Egyptian Women. FMG (Female Genital Mutilation) is not a religious practise and doesn't make a Woman pure.
