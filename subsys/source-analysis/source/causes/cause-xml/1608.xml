  <description>In today's super-information society, war is obsolete. 

All conflicts arise in thought and conclude in shared mediation, but the devastation of a nuclear response demonstrates the intermediate stage of violent conflict on a global scale to be a literal nightmare.

There is such a thing as a global citizen; in fact, we are one.

As soon as the population of world was known [we, of the two-eyes-one-nose-one-mouth] never quite made the leap to a sense of internationalism the same way we completely internalized a sense of nationalism [the same "we" again, eh?] as soon as our nations shared goals could be enumerated.

If you have peace as a distant goal, the way to achieve it is by getting closer.

There are few who wouldn't value true peace.  If both sides in a conflict are seeking it, seek respectful actions towards yourself and the other person; there is always a mutually agreeable solution but it might take creativity to find. The means are the ends in the making.

1. War is obsolete [but not yet extinct]

2. We are one [together on a planet]

3. The means are the ends in the making [you get where you're going by getting there]</description>
