  <description>This group is open to active students and faculty members at Georgetown College, but this CAUSE is open to everyone to wishes to support it.  

We have monthly meetings to discuss ways to reach out to the community to expand knowledgeable information about the issues faced by the Gay and Lesbian Community.

We also have weekly support group meetings to get together and discuss life issues that members are facing in their life and at Georgetown College. Along with these meetings food &amp; drink will be provided.

We would like to think you for you support and your donations to help aid us in our goals and to fund our needs.  

All support and donations are appreciated.
