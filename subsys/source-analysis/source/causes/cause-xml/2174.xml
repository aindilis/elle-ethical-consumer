  <description>The Honeysuckle Foundation for Children with Cancer was started by Alicia Giacalone when she was 6 years old and a cancer patient in the hospital. She wanted to help others and used the money she made from selling jewelry to start this foundation. The goal of the foundation is to help families cope with the change that a sick child brings to their lives. The foundation emphasizes how metal health is just as important in a patients treatment as their medications and that even little things can make a big difference. You can help.

1. state of mind is as important as medication.

2. sick kids are still kids.

3. one dollar at a time we can all make a difference in the life of a cancer child</description>
