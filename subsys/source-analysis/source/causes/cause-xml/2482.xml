  <description>People are trying to get laws passed requiring that all LIVING pit bulls be ruthlessly murdered because of a few stupid people who don't know how to take care of their animals. 

This group is for discussing methods and sharing petitions against breed-specific legislation. 

1. All animals are potentially dangerous in the hands of the wrong people. 

2. Why are there laws to protect these animals from fighting rings if those same laws turn around and kill them? 

3. We don't execute humans with violent family history. Why would we execute a dog that has committed no crime other than being of the same species?

4. If we eliminate pit bulls, dog fighters will find other dogs to fight. </description>
