  <description>Amaazon.com is unfair in that it does not ship outside of the U.S. unless you go to amazon.ca,.co.uk,Etc. thus being able to jack up the prices way beyond necessary means. it is this unfairness that drives The Boycott Amaazon.com Coalition.

1. Amazon.com should and will be boycotted
