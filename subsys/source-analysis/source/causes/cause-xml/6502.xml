  <description>Not so long ago there was a mighty car that we simply called "The Volvo". Once we tried to name it but it crashed itself into a jersey wall... but it still ran and stuff. But then the great Joel was tempted by an evil evil power of satanic proportions, A riced Honda! Joel was tricked by an evil rice pushing salesman named Dean Hart who lives in a trailer near Fairfax Honda, Fairfax Virginia! The filthy demon spawn seductress econo-box ultimately committed an emo suicide by blowing its own head gasket and cracking a cylinder wall on the highway. This left Joel, the pizza delivery man without a ride and therfore without an income to purchase a new ride. He has relied upon various noble beaters including Sir Neon, Sir Subaru, Sir Escort, and Sir Prizm (all of which still run). But now It is time for the return of the great Volvo.
