  <description>Best Buddies is a national not-for-profit organizaion that has been present in Canada since 1993 and has been active at Memorial University since 2002.  

This program is about creating friendships between people who may not otherwise have had the chance to meet!  Contact between students and persons with developmental disabilities seldom occurs spontaneously.

A Best Buddies friendship helps to break down barriers to inclusion and provides opportunities for shared experience, laughter, and support.

If you are interested in becoming a volunteer, please email me at mun_bestbuddies@yahoo.ca
