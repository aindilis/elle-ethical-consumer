  <description>Paris Hilton, was freed from jail after only 3 days.  She has gotten special treatment based solely on her "celebrity status".
What sort of example does this set for people?  Is it right that she be granted special treatment based upon her social standing?  
NO IT IS NOT!!!!!

Paris Hilton is guilty of breach of probation.  She was caught driving while her liscense was under suspension for drunk driving.
Any other citizen guilty of such an offence would be made to finish out their sentence.  So should she.

Yes, she will be under house arrest for the remainder of her sentence, but I say this still isn't good enough!!!!

****Important UpDate******
Paris Hilton was ordered to return to court today, June 8th 2007, and made made to serve out the full term of her sentence in Jail.

Good News Indeed !!!!!!

1. Celebrities should not recieve special treatment when they are guilty of a crime

2. Paris Hilton should be made an example of</description>
