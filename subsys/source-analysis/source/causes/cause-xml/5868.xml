  <description>Child abuse is the physical and/or psychological/emotional mistreatment of children. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts or commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. Most child abuse occurs in a child's home, with a smaller amount occurring in the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with. There are four major categories of child abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological/emotional abuse, and sexual abuse.


Children with a history of neglect or physical abuse are at risk of developing psychiatric problems, or a disorganized attachment style. Disorganized attachment is associated with a number of developmental problems, including dissociative symptoms, as well as anxiety, depressive, and acting-out symptoms. Approximately 80% of abused and maltreated infants exhibited symptoms of disorganized attachment later on.

Child Literacy and its affiliates envisage and implement upon programs that help abused children lead normal lives. Education and a healthy environment are critical in ensuring that abused kids can lead a normal life. Child Literacy and its affiliates work towards providing such children opportunities to join mainstream children.</description>
