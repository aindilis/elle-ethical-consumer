  <description>Since we began in 2000, the Foundation has funded more than $91 million in Parkinson's research, either directly or through partnerships. And every one of those dollars has helped us learn more about the disease, develop better treatments for patients and, ultimately, get us closer to ending Parkinson's.

Michael J. Fox was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's disease in 1991. Armed with the knowledge that with proper funding, a cure for Parkinson's disease was within reach, Fox publicly disclosed his condition in 1998 and committed himself to the campaign for increased Parkinson's awareness and research funding. To that end, in 2000, The Michael J. Fox Foundation was launched. The Foundation raises private funds and, working with its Scientific Advisory Board, directs those funds to promising research opportunities worldwide.
