  <description>Paris Hilton was convicted of DUI and a hit and run type accident thing, was sentenced to 45 days in jail...her sentence was then reduced to 23 days.  
After more whining and bitching...she was released from jail far too early....she needs to go back.

1. Paris Hilton is not the only one that needs jailtime.

2. Lindsay Lohan

3. Nicole Richie</description>
