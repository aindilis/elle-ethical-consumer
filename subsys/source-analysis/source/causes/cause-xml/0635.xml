  <description>Met Council, founded in 1958, is a membership organization dedicated to preserving and expanding New York City&#8217;s supply of decent, affordable housing. Most New Yorkers live in rented apartments&#8212;almost all low, moderate, and middle-income people in New York rent their homes&#8212;and over 1 million of those apartments are covered by rent regulations. Met Council focuses on preserving rental housing and strengthening tenants&#8217; rights. Rent-regulated tenants have more long-term stability, better services, and lower rents than those who rent on the open market.

1. Housing is a human right.

2. Housing for people, not for profit.

3. Preserve, strengthen, and expand tenant protections.</description>
