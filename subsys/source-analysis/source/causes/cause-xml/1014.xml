  <description>You may take comfort in knowing that organizations like YouthNoise are helping harness positive change on global warming, poverty injustice and other issues.  Through YouthNoise, a simple call to action can quickly engage tens of thousands in a cause or urgent request for support.  Never before has the impact of such a network been stronger and never before has the YouthNoise mission been more relevant.

Yet, funding is increasingly difficult to secure, so your support is needed.  YouthNoise is a not-for-profit organization funded by friends like you. Your gift is tax deductible and goes a long way to supporting the work of inspiring young people. Please give online at www.youthnoise.org/donate
