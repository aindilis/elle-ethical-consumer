  <description>Why do people indiscriminately breed their pets without knowing what they're doing? Why do they do this and end up with animals that they don't "want"? most of these animals end up dead/let free (into the "wild")/in shelters. Shelters are not fun places. Yes there are some good ones out there that try to make the animal comfortable and happy, but it's not a HOME. What's worse is that people don't ADOPT. There are some animals that have lived their whole life in a shelter. Don't breed. Don't buy. Adopt.

1. Don't indiscriminately breed animals.

2. Adopt, don't buy.</description>
