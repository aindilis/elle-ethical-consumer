  <description>Immigration is a defining feature of America&#8217;s history and of America&#8217;s future.  Unfortunately, America&#8217;s current immigration system is broken.  Instead of legal channels, legal immigration, and orderly, screened entry, the immigration system has fostered a black market characterized by a ballooning undocumented immigrant population, widespread use of fake documents, increasingly violent smuggling cartels, and widespread exploitation of undocumented workers.  The American people are frustrated with their leaders on this issue and hunger for a solution that will work.  They want neither open borders, nor closed borders, they want smart borders.  The time has come for the President and Congress to work together to enact comprehensive legislation that rewards work, reunites families, restores the rule of law, reinforces our nation&#8217;s security, respects the rights of U.S.-born and immigrant workers, and redeems the American Dream.
