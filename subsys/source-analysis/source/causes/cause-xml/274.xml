  <description>This cause is to bring awareness to the situation of women throughout the world, who unfortunately face pregnancy with fear and uncertainty, due to a lack of care and services. Needless lives are endangered due to this problem. We must do something now to save women throughout the world. 

Glory Reborn provides free care to the women of the Philippines, what local doctors here have claimed, "Is like going to a private hospital without the hospital bills." We pride ourselves in the quality of the care, and with the education that we provide to each woman who visits our clinic we are hopeful of a bright future.


Currently Glory Reborn provides all this care for free, and simply put the numbers are:

If 50 people will donate $100 dollars a month, we can do this and more for a whole year!

If 100 people will donate $50 dollars a month, we can do this for another year!

You get the idea...

Or better yet, pass on one Grande Latte a week, and 3 women will have healthy pregnancies!
(3 bucks a week, 52 weeks, 156 bucks) Plus our program is non-fat, calorie and sugar free...it may not taste good, but it feels good.
