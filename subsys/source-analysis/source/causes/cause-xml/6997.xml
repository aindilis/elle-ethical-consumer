  <description>This is to help introduce Cystic Fibrosis more to the world, everyone needs to know that CF is a life threatening disease and kills many people. My Goal is to help support other organizations in the steps towards fighting CF and finding a cure. As the Administrator of the cause I too am diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis and am helping to fight the cause for my well being as well as all who suffer around the world.
