  <description>Unfortunately, everyone's karma about getting busted caught up with me on a Monday morning after working all night at Theater in the Park. I have a felony for possession of 4 adderall and 2 riddelin, which you can ask anyone, doesn't exactly make sense. And two misdemeanors for an empty container and someone else's roach that they put in my ashtray. Yes, I messed up and I'm greatly greatly dealing with it. But if I get the money for a decent lawyer the felony will be gone and my life will be able to go on as normal, well as normal as it could be. My parents said it's all up to me, and even though I work two jobs it'll still be very tough. Please give me your love and support. I really need it in every way you can imagine.


If you want my address and want to help me out... message me... that'd be amazing.

1. It was a wrong place at the wrong time situation, Diana is a good kid

2. The need for a good lawyer is imperitive for everything to turn out alright

3. Other people's assistance would ease this awfully intense pressure more than imaginable</description>
