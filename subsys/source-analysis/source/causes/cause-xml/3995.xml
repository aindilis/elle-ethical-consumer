  <description>Here at AMREF we aim to empower people to live better lives on their own resources without needing future aid. We invest in people, we invest in training. Through community partnership and training we enable individuals, doctors and communities to access better health care, avoid getting sick, access clean water and start businesses. People who are well can work, attend school, look after their families and are strong enough to make the right decisions for their future.

This cause is meant to use the potential of Facebook to reach out to the millions that use it. To allow the people with resources to give a small amount of help to another. One person can help a cause, a million people helping the same cause will change the world. The little bit that you give helps thousands. 

The goal of this cause is to achieve 1,000,000 members. Each member that joins is asked to send $ 5. That is $5,000,000 to be sent to AMREF. Each member that joins is asked to invite everyone that they know on Facebook, which will spreads this message fast.

1. Give them a fish and they eat for a day, teach them to fish and they eat for the rest of their lives.

2. Not just giving needed resources, but educating on how to achieve the resources on their own.</description>
