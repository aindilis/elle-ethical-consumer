  <description>After 13 years of legendary Human Rights investigations, medical rescues and an aggressive push for accountability in the corporate/political realms relating to atrocities at sea, SOS is now engaged in a desperate struggle to save human life onshore.  Focusing again on exploitation, SOS is fighting to give a voice to thousands of Agro-Chemical poisoning victims in sugar cane worker-communities, where graveyards overflow as homes empty.  On this ground, we have established a tenuous beachhead for the advancement of the most basic human right: Life.

1. People have a right to a safe work environment.

2. People should be treated fairly regardless of ethnic background or economic status.

3. Worldwide injustices in work ethics must be exposed and resolved.
