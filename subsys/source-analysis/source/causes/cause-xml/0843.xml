  <description>Rabbi Keller and his family have spent countless hours raising money For The Sefer Torah that is being written in Bentzions Memory, Unfortunately they are still short by a substantial amount. 

Bentzion was a dear friend to many of us, And we all miss him &amp; love him. Let us show our respect by helping out in his memory.  

Remember, every dollar helps!

Tizku Lemitzvos &amp; may we see Bentzion &amp; each other In yerusholaim very soon!

1. Smile for Bentzion!

2. Do A Mitzvah For Bentzion!</description>
