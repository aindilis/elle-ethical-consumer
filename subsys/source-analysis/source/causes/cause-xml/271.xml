Has the heinous practice of slavery ended? NO. Are you aware that there are more slaves in the world today than there were in America before the abolitionists? FACT.

It is believed that 27 million people are enslaved globally. This includes men, women, and children who are bought and sold for labor, warfare, and the sex industry. World Vision reports that children as young as 5 years old are sold as prostitutes. Most people believe that slavery has been abolished, but unfortunately this isn't true. You can help by simply combating the problem of ignorance by researching and telling someone about this horrific crime. Also, contact your legislators and let them know that you want more laws enacting harsher punishments for these offenders, and more comprehensive services in place to rescue and restore victims of human trafficking. A human life is not for sale.
