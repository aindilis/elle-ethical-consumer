  <description>The Church Reloaded is a church yet it has no walls.  We are not a building, we are collection of people who believe in God and have changed out thinking and living to reflect such.  Currently we hold regular worship services on the campus of Northwood University in the Griwold Lecture Hall.

The word "Reloaded" comes from the 2003 movie The Matrix Reloaded which ushered in the idea that although truth never changes what we do with that truth does.  We welcome you to visit our website at www.thechurchreloaded.com, attend one of our worship services or talk to people on facebook that are in our group.

For those who do donate, the funds go through our parent organization Christian Celebration Center.  100% of the funds will be allocated to The Church Reloaded.  If you have any questions please contact us.

Please also contact us to receive scriptural references for all of our beliefs.</description>
