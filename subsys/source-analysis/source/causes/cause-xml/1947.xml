  <description>When I think of reiki, I think of letting go of illness and creating a scenario that helps people to free themselves from blocks.

Think a minute to consider what your own life would be like if the only way for you to feel better came from a needle and not from the touch of a loved one.

Perhaps taking a reiki class or having a session with a reiki practitioner could help.
