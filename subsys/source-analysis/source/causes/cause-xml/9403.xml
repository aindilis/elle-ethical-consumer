  <description>Every year, tens of millions of Asian children die of starvation, exhaustion, infection, dysentery, dehydration, parasites, and other diseases that come from overpopulation and squalid conditions. It all comes down to that. These poor children die every day, only to be replaced by the ever increasing supply of people that so epitomizes the eastern Asian lifestyles.

To note, it is estimated that there are:
-273 Million suffering children in China
-373 Million in India
-30 Million in the Indochina region

That's 576,000,000 innocent children doomed to die a long, slow, painful death simply because they committed the crime of being born in a poor nation.

Obviously, we cannot adopt them all. For comparison, the United States has 281 Million people, including children and adults.

How can YOU help? Help us end their suffering, once and for all. For just 50 cents, you can buy a quick and painless means to end the terrifying lives of these poor children. 

What if you don't donate?
Well, that's just another poor, innocent child, doomed to die. Don't worry, though. No one else is.



1. To provide a painless, peaceful means of end for the half-billion suffering Asian children.

2. To spread awareness to other groups that might be able to help.</description>
