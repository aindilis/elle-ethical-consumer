  <description>We are in a critical time for biodiversity.  In the history of life on earth there have been roughly 5 mass extinctions, the last major one being 65 million years ago when the dinosaurs died out.  We are currently undergoing the 6th global mass extinction event, caused by human beings through habitat destruction, introduced invasive species, pollution, and more.  The current rate of mass extinction is exceeding the rate of any other mass extinction event in the history of life on earth, at the current rate within 50 years about one half of all species remaining today will be gone forever.  This is why BC Biodiversity was created - to supply free access to information about the biological diversity (biodiversity) we have here in British Columbia. Hopefully with education then we can reduce the current rate of extinction through remediation projects and sound decisionmaking.

1. native biological diversity should be protected from habitat destruction and competition with invasive introduced species

2. educating people about native biodiversity is a critical step in preservation

3. where possible volunteer remediation projects should be set up - such as the removal of invasive species and encouraging governments and citizens to grow native species in their yards</description>
