  <description>Istra was diagnosed with Pervasive Development Disorder a few months before her 4th birthday in 2004. Since then we tried a number of things, but the most successful has been the Son Rise Programme we started 18 months ago (www.autismtreatmentcenter.org). We are raising funds for a one-week intensive at the Son Rise-Programme that creates miracles for children on the autism spectrum. It costs 15,000 US$ and we have so far raised from family and friends 2,000 US$.

1. Label us able!

2. Nothing about us without us!</description>
