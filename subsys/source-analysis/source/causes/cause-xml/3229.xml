  <description>From ancient secrets to modern day books, the power of a thought has never been so revealed. Recent studies and theories show that positive thoughts have incredible capabilities, even possibly healing ones. With that in mind, how can we turn our thoughts into positive tools of bettering not only ourselves but the world as well? The answer is a network that works with individuals or groups with charitable needs, connecting them with people around the world that send them good thoughts. Everyday, a profile will be selected randomly and emailed to all the members. Their only obligation is to take time to read a short profile summary and then to send a good thought to them. If they choose to they can email profiles, donate money, comment on them, and so on. There are several great aspects of this network. For one, all we ask for are good thoughts. It is possibly the least amount of charity effort anyone could do, but with the combined effort of many thoughts, the results will be incredible. 




1. Good thoughts have healing power, and with the combined effort of many we can bring relief to the world in the easiest of ways. 

2. Good thoughts are universal, they cross boundries, join science and belief, and bring miracles to life. 

3. We need your good thoughts to help people in need!</description>
