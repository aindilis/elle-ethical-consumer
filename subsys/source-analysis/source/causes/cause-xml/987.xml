  <description>The NSPCC casenotes on sexual abuse do not make pleasant reading.

In its 20-year history, ChildLine has
counselled more than 175,000 children
about sexual abuse.

In 2005/06, a total of 11,976 children
spoke to ChildLine about sexual abuse &#8211; an
average of more than one full classroom of
children per day, every day of the year.

On average, children who contact
ChildLine about sexual abuse now do so
much sooner after the abuse begins than
they used to.

In 94 per cent of calls to ChildLine about
sexual abuse in 2005/06, the child knew
his or her abuser. Fifty-nine per cent of
abusers were family members, 35 per
cent were acquaintances, and 5 per cent
were strangers.

Children waited longer before contacting
ChildLine when the sexual abuse was
committed by a father or stepfather.

When the abuse was by an acquaintance
or stranger, victims were much more
likely to contact ChildLine soon after the
abuse began.
