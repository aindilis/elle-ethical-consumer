  <description>The current crisis in Darfur began in 2003. After decades of neglect, drought, oppression and small-scale conflicts in Darfur, two rebel groups &#8211; the Sudanese Liberation Army/Movement (SLA/M) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) &#8211; mounted a challenge to Sudan&#8217;s president, Omar al-Bashir. These groups represent agrarian farmers who are mostly non-Arab black African Muslims from a number of different tribes. President al-Bashir&#8217;s response was brutal. In seeking to defeat the rebel movements, the Government of Sudan increased arms and support to local tribal and other militias, which have come to be known as the Janjaweed.&lt;!--[if !supportFootnotes]--&gt;[1]&lt;!--[endif]--&gt; Their members are composed mostly of Arab black African Muslims&lt;!--[if !supportFootnotes]--&gt;[2]&lt;!--[endif]--&gt; who herd cattle, camels, and other livestock. They have wiped out entire villages, destroyed food and water supplies, and systematically murdered, tortured, and raped hundreds of thousands of Darfurians. These attacks occur with the direct support of the Government of Sudan&#8217;s armed forces.

1. Murder, rape, and torture of the Sudanese people must stop now!!!

2. All people have the right to freedom!!</description>
