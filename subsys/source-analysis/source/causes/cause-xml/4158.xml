  <description>Greyhound racing constitutes animal abuse because of the industry's excessive surplus breeding practices, the often cruel methods by which unwanted dogs are destroyed, the daily conditions in which many dogs are forced to live, and the killing and maiming of bait animals, such as rabbits, during training exercises. The industry exists solely for the entertainment and profit of people&#8212;often at the expense of the animals' welfare. Taken from &lt;a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/running_for_their_lives_the_realities_of_greyhound_racing/greyhound_racing_facts.html"&gt;HSUS&lt;/a&gt;

And don't forget to join &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2386494895"&gt;our group&lt;/a&gt;. It'd be great if you could post any links in relation to Greyhounds (ie, good PR for pet greyhounds, any news on the evils of the greyhound racing and breeding industry).

Thanks for your help!

1. Organized Greyhound racing and breeding for racing programs must be banned now.

2. Dogs should not be bred as a commodity

3. Senseless killing of 'under performing' greyhounds must cease immediately.</description>
