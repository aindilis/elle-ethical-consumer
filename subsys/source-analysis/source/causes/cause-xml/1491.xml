  <description>To let people know about scoliosis and getting it checked out earlier in life in order to prevent it.  Give advice and support to people who have questions or worries about it.

1. Scoliosis can be treated if caught early enough in life.

2. Back surgery is not necessary if caught soon enough and a back brace is worn.

3. It is possible for almost everyone to have a little bit of an "S" curve in their back which is scoliosis.</description>
