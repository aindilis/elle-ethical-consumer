  <description>Pray for your priests like they are your family.  Pray for them every day.  Fast for them.  Make a Holy Hour for them.  Pray for more priests!  :-)  Just keep praying for the priesthood.

1. Our priests are a fundamental part of our faith and have given themselves to serve us.

2. There is a shortage of priests, and it is up to the people of the Church not only to pray for the priests, but to raise their sons to consider religious vocations. 

3. We should pray for our priests constantly, and we should pray hard for them.</description>
