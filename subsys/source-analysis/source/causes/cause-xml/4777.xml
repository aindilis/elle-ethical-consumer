  <description>I wish to hear one news broadcast that doesn't mention manual killing in New Orleans. I wish to contribute counciling as a punishment for death and see what makes a killer tick and see if we can stop this, once and for all!

1. The Bible teaches us"Though shalt not kill."

2. There are better ways of vengance than violence and they should be taught. Just as they taught me "no hitting" in preschool.</description>
