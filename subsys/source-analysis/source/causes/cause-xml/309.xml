  <description>&#8220;Stick to a Cause&#8221; is a charity organization led by college students to promote awareness and raise knowledge about fair trade (not free trade), international debt relief, and the plight of exploited workers around the world. Our mission is to help others become informed on ways in which they can help less fortunate men, women, and children around the world who lack access to proper healthcare, education, and labor rights. To this end, we encourage people who come across our page (or anyone who is invited to look at our page) to ask us questions about how they can help, why certain policies of the IMF and CAFTA (as well as others) are not serving beneficial purposes in areas like Central America, and to confront us with any other questions or points of interest we might be able to address.

1. Every child deserves the opportunity for a better future.

2. Farmers deserve fair payment for their yields.

3. Every person deserves a food for his or her family and a safe place to sleep.

4. Those who have the greater capacity to help should do more to help.

5. Political agenda does not affect one's ability to help others.</description>
