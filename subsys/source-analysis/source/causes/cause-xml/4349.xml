  <description> seven-year-old boy from Lancaster, Ontario who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia when he was only five. On June 6th, 2006 Shane and his family received some unfortunate news: Shane experienced a relapse after completing 108 of 130 weeks of treatment.

However, despite the bad news, Shane has managed to keep a positive outlook on his situation and has made a heart-warming wish... He hasn&#8217;t asked for money or toys or anything of the sort. Instead, his birthday is on May 30th and he would like to break the world record for the most birthday cards ever received. His goal is 350 million cards. With every card, Shane&#8217;s courage grows. Something as simple as sending a birthday card could be enough to help Shane find peace and joy in his current circumstances.

We as students gave Shane over 1,160 birthday cards.
He received over 350 million birthday cards.
Now they won't let him put it in the books.
Show support for Shane Bernier.
