  <description>What is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection?

The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes an illness that usually resembles a moderate to severe cold and is very contagious. RSV most often goes away on its own and does not cause major health concerns. This infection can become a problem when it is severe or leads to complications. Babies (especially those born prematurely), people with immune system problems, people with heart or lung problems, and older adults have an increased risk of developing complications from RSV infection.
