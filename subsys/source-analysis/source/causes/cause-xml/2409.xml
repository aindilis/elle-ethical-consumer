  <description>In 2006 I went to a muscular dystrophy summer camp. I was not sure what was going to happen when I got there. I was paired with a child who had muscular dystrophy. I spent the next week caring and having the best week with him and others who have the same or similar muscular dystrophy. This year I recently got back from going to the camp to volunteer for a week. Muscular Dystrophy is a muscle disease that causes progressive muscle weakness. In some cases it will eventually attack the heart and a child will die at a very young age. It costs $650 for  someone with muscular dystrophy to attend this camp. It is my goal to help raise enough money to send 50 kids if not more, to a place where the word "Disability" can be replaced with "Ability". That is only $32,500. My outlook on life changed after going to this camp. I want to do everything possible to help those who are not capable to do all the things that some of us take for granted. I want these kids to live life to the fullest and support them all the way!
