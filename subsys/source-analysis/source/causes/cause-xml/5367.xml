  <description>The Grady Paul Larson Foundation will lead a non-denominational effort to demonstrate faith in action and community service, to those who do not have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, by sponsoring sporting events that benefit the Make-A- Wish Foundation &#174; of Iowa or other charitable human service organizations.

We hold softball tournaments to sponsor children.

1. Jesus is Lord.

2. Do it for the kids</description>
