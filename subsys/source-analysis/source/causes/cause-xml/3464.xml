  <description>   Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder that is inherited. It is the most common fatal genetic disease affecting Canadian's. It affects both the lungs and digestive system. 

   It Creates a thick layer of mucus in the lungs, resulting in cycles of infection which damages the lounge tissue. This also causes severe breathing problems.

   The mucus also blocks the ducts of the pancreas, preventing the production of enzymes to digest the food in the intestines. This makes it difficult for nutrients to be absorbed. 

   Due to this, people with CF must consume, on average, 20 pills a day with every meal to help them absorb the needed nutrients from food.
