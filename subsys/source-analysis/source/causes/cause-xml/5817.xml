  <description>Teens today are becoming more and more careless when it comes to driving and being smart behind the wheel.  My mission is to try and spread the word on practicing safe driving.  For instance, always designate a driver to remain sober.  Even if drinking underage isn't the smartest of ideas, atleast take on the responsibility of your actions and being mature enough to know that drinking and driving is not safe.

1. Careless driving ends lives.  Let's end careless driving.

2. Driving while under the influence shouldn't be a choice.

3. Teens today can make a difference in the smallest of groups, let's start now.</description>
