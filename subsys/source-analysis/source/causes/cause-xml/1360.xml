  <description>We believe that all men are created equal, therefore E.R.A.C.E. is a publicly supported organization that promotes reconciliation and unity among all races. Many barriers have been erected to help facilitate human hatred or apathy that has persisted over time.

E.R.A.C.E. is a non-profit organization focused on dismantling these invisible yet socially destructive boundaries-boundaries that have been fortified by the divisiveness of racial discrimination.

E.R.A.C.E. wants to celebrate the diversity of the human race rather than use our differences as a pretense for racial separation. Through communication, love, understanding and the rebuilding of relationships, E.R.A.C.E. hopes to repair the dysfunctional state of the human family.
