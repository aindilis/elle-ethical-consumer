  <description>Girls and Guys are EQUAL.

Women should be given the same chance in all things.
Eg. Girls CAN play football
Eg. Guys CAN take care of their children.

1. Men and women are equal

2. No one should be treated differantly for any reason

3. 'because im a girl'     thats NO excuse

4. theres no such thing as 'girl push-ups'

5. girls can do almost everything that guys can do

6. guys can do almost everything that a woman can do</description>
