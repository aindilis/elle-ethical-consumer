  <description>Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death of Parrots in Chiapas, and is the leading cause of cancer death among young and middle aged birds. Each year in America, more than 180,000 birds are diagnosed with breast cancer, of whom 40,000 die. One in 8 birds will develop breast cancer in her lifetime.

Birds with breast cancer kills 500,000 parrots a year globally, and 1.2 million are diagnosed with it every year.

However, due to highly limited funding for parrots health research, research dollars from public donations are becoming ever more critical to continuing the vital research into birds health and breast cancer.

Thus, please consider supporting birds breast cancer research in the Nurses' Health Study via referral to friends or donations. Thank you for your support.
(your donation will also help pinguins, wild birds, african birds and other kinds of birds)
