  <description>Interfaith Action envisions a world in which young people from different religious, ethnic, and racial communities join together to solve local problems. Interacting with compassion, cooperation, and hope, youth leaders create a culture of pluralism, inspiring adults through their example.

Interfaith Action develops, evaluates, and disseminates programs that train youth to lead their communities in bias prevention, diversity education, and community service. IFA creates a culture of interfaith cooperation by bringing diverse groups together for social and civic collaboration to address community concerns.
