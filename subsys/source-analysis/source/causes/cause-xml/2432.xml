CABF currently supports thousands of parents whose children have Bipolar Disorder, but the hope and dream of CABF is to one day change the stigma attached to children who have the disease and to educate the people deal with these children on a daily basis such as teachers, doctors, and mental health care workers.  CABF supports research on new and better treatments and possible cures.
