  <description>Battered puppy needs operations
Black Labrador found in a ditch dehydrated and with broken legs
A black Labrador puppy needs your help after she was found abandoned in a ditch near Shubenacadie on Wednesday, dehydrated and starving, her two front legs broken and her bones showing through her fur.

The puppy&#8217;s injuries appear to be from a beating, not from being hit by a car.

Anyone interested in helping or adopting Lilly can contact the Labrador Rescue Club at 883-4799 or visit its website at www.labrescuens.com.

The Beneficiary: International Fund for Animal Welfare, Inc is not the beneficiary but i could not find the rescue club in facebook.
