  <description>Rooted in literacy and basic education, World Education catalyzes social change at the grassroots level through global programs that link education with economic, health, social, and civic development. Our programs equip individuals and local partner organizations with the tools they need to develop and manage programs designed to benefit them and forge strong linkages with government officials, policy makers, and funders whose support is critical to long-term success. Our focus areas include girls' and women's education, human trafficking and child labor, HIV/AIDS prevention and care, savings, credit and micro enterprise, and strengthening the adult basic literacy system in the United States. Our programs serve adults, adolescents and children in 26 countries around the world, primarily in Africa, Asia and United States.
