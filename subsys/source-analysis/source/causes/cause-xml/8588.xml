  <description>OUR DREAM

Our dream is to join in the activity of God in the world wherever we are able, partnering with God as God&#8217;s dreams for our world come true. In the process, the world can be healed and changed, and so can we.

EMERGENT

In English, the word &#8220;emergent&#8221; is normally an adjective meaning coming into view, arising from, occurring unexpectedly, requiring immediate action (hence its relation to &#8220;emergency&#8221;), characterized by evolutionary emergence, or crossing a boundary (as between water and air). All of these meanings resonate with the spirit and vision of Emergent Village. In other languages, names for regional networks will be chosen with similarly evocative meanings.

1. &#8220;Growing&#8221;: which indicates our desire to develop as the dreams of God for the healing, redemption, and reconciliation of the world develop.

2. &#8220;Generative&#8221;: which means that we expect our friendship to generate new ideas, connections, opportunities, and works of beauty.

3. &#8220;Friendship&#8221;: Because we firmly hold that living in reconciled friendship trumps traditional orthodoxies &#8211; indeed, orthodoxy requires reconciliation as a prerequisite.

4. &#8220;Missional&#8221;: Because we believe that the call of the gospel is an outward, apostolic call into the world.</description>
