"Reminder &amp; Unfortunate update. Breast Cancer comp.
A while back I sent out a message about a climbing comp for breast cancer awareness. In the message I wrote of how my mom was struggling with breast cancer &amp; it is now time to say that she lost that battle to breast cancer this past sat, June 23, at 7 pm. Gerry Wilson was an incredible mom, wife, &amp; friend &amp; a disease that is simply unfair should never have taken such a good women. She had been fighting the horrible disease for 9 years but her body had taken every medication that could possibley help her. Having seen that there is nothing left to help someone you love more than anything, pushes so strongly the need to find a breast cancer cure out there. So if it is possible for your presence or support in any way for the July 21st awareness for breast cancer comp @ Redpoint Indoor Climbing gym, just know that my dad, sis, &amp; myself would appreciate it so much.
R.I.P. Gerry Wilson 6/23/07
Sincerely,
Heidi Wilson"
