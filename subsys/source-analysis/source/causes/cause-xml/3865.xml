  <description>The O's are moving to Germany August 1st to dive full time into a missionary teaching position at Black Forest Academy. The Academy is located in Kandern, Germany. Craig will be teaching high school Biology at Black Forest to missionary kids from all over the world as well as to foreign exchange students.

Black Forest Academy does not pay a salary to staff members. BFA does not &#8220;employ&#8221; staff members and does not pay compensation to its staff members. BFA staff are employed by various mission boards and mission sending agencies. Staff members serve at BFA under the umbrella of a mission organization, usually serving an initial assignment of two years. BFA staff not only serve missionaries; the staff of BFA are missionaries themselves. BFA&#8217;s participating missions assist their missionaries in raising one&#8217;s own financial support from a sponsorship team made up of churches and/or a group of friends and family. Funds are then directed through the mission to provide for staff salaries.

Thanks for your support and prayers.
