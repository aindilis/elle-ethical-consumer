  <description>With a changing society and new laws coming about, more and more negative attention is coming towards homosexuals.  We plan to end this discrimination, hatred, and fear of them, as they are just like us.

1. There is only one difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals: Whom they are attracted to.

2. They deserve the right to be treated the same way any heterosexual person would.

3. They deserve the right of marriage.</description>
