  <description>Jediism has been a growing religious movement for number of years now and within the past few it has become more and more organized.  I believe Jediism is the understanding of truth, justice, peace, and oneness with the universe.  Although there are multiple Jedi temples online we are still young and hoping for a chance to unite all Jedi communities into one.

1. To protect and serve the members of society.

2. To bring peace to the world with the Jedi Teachings.

3. To become truly at peace with oneself.</description>
