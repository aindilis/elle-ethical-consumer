  <description>Egypt has been the crib of civilizations through history, but unfortunately now it is a place where no civil rights is kept. As an Egyptian and a Muslim i am inviting all of you to make Egypt a better place, by simply having ethics and being civilized in our daily interaction.    

* Please no political arguments are to be posted as it kills the constructive and healthy discussion environment, Better Egypt is a place to discuss ways to improve Egypt with or without the government. 

** Members are welcome to give ideas to improve Egypt in all fields should it be technical or social or whatever.
