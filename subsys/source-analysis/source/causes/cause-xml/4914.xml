  <description>Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has been plagued with a violent unrest. It has endured, and single-handedly dominated a host of powers arrayed against it. It has suffered countless barbaric acts of terrorism directed at its unsuspecting citizens, and although one of the youngest and smallest countries in the world, Israel has gone through more than most. Its formidable IDF is one of the world's mightiest armies, and is a force to be reckoned with.

Wherever we stand, we stand with Israel.

1. Israel has the right to exist

2. Israel has the right to defend itself, by any means necessary, against attacks and terrorism</description>
