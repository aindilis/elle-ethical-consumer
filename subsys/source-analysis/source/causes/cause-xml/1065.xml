  <description>Mystic Aquarium was one of the founders of the Northeast Region (Marine mammal) Stranding Program and is called out to over 80 strandings each year. 

Mystic Aquarium is a comprehensive marinelife educational and research facility which operates year-round with over 1 million people visiting each year. In addition to the visitor facilities, there is a research component, both on site and in other locations throughout the world, and an educational component with many programs conducted off-site in schools throughout the region. It is also the coordination site of Jason programs.

Donations will help this research as well as helping to get the stranded animals back to the ocean.
