  <description>Donate in memory of my little brother Elijah Clouse. To Missouri Baptist NICU, or St. Louis Children Hospital.

My amazing little brother Elijah Clouse fought for his life. When he was born he had rear disability. PUV, His lungs and kidneys where not developed. There really nothing that anyone could do. The wonderful children hospital came to Missouri Baptist did the best they could do. But Elijah was just in to big of a hurry to get back home to God. 2hrs of being with us he did just that. He left us and went to heaven to be with Lord God.  On November 18th 2006.

I ask that you please remember Elijah.
