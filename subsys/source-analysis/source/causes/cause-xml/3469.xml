  <description>I'm tired of turning on MTV and seeing mike jones. Gross. Or some other crap band who is only popular through the channeling of popular media.

I want to listen to music simply because I like it. Not because someone tells me its cool and I have to.

As for the whole donation thing, don't worry about all that. Just spread the word as much as possible because we don't need money to fix this problem. All we really need are people with voices who want to be heard.

1. Music is for everyone.

2. Musicians should be appreciated, not hated upon simply because you don't like their music.

3. Music, especially hardcore music, is not to show off your fashion sense like guyliner and chick pants, but to voice your opinion.

4. Dare to be different and listen to something because you want to.</description>
