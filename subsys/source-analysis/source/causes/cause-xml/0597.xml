  <description>Across the world, more than 30 million people live in slavery today. Human Trafficking has become the fastest growing criminal industry on the globe, yet a new wave of Modern-Day Abolitionists are taking action to combat it.

NOT FOR SALE equips and empowers smart activists as they deploy innovative solutions to re-Abolish slavery--in their own backyards and across the globe.

Every individual has a skill they can contribute to free those living in bondage, and together, we can end slavery in our lifetime.

I am not for sale. You are not for sale. NO ONE should be for sale. Welcome to the movement.
