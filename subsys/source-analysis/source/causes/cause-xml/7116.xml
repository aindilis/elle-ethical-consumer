  <description>The chorus consists of the finest singers in San Diego, many of whom have longstanding experience with such ensembles and performers as The Waverly Consort, The Philharmonia Chorale, American Bach Soloists, James Bowman, Julianne Baird, Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra, and Musica Angelica Baroque Orchestra.

The orchestra of the Bach Collegium San Diego was founded in 2005 to act as the instrumental counterpart to the chorus and is the first period instrument orchestra to be established in San Diego.  The orchestra features a core group of players who are active with such ensembles as the Academy of Ancient Music, American Bach Soloists, Musica Angelica Baroque Orchestra, Portland Baroque Orchestra Philharmonia Baroque, and the Academy of Ancient Music.
