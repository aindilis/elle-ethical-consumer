  <description>She is a young woman of unequalled talent- her orchestral career began at the age of 6 - and unbelievably, she was accepted into one of the world's primiere schools of performing arts, JULLIARD, in NYC, when she was eleven years old.

Best known for shining as Josh Groban's violinist in both his CLOSER and AWAKE tours, 23 year old Lucia Micarelli's music is powerful enough to melt the coldest heart. 

She is a fierce, extremely talented, and exotically beautiful musician. I have NEVER seen anyone feel and move with music the way she does. She is my hero, and deserves recognition for the genius she's worked so hard to achieve...AND she plays in bare feet :)

AND SO, THIS GROUP IS TO HONOR HER, THE ANGEL OF MUSIC; AND SPREAD HER TALENT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WORLD!

produced by our very own Josh Groban-
