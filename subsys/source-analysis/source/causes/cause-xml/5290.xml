  <description>Invader Zim is the best animated series in my opinion and I really wish that we will be able to see even more episodes of Invader Zim. 

Help spread the word by inviting to this cause so that more people will find out about this show. Never mind if the persons you invite never have heard about Invader Zim, if they ask you it's just an excuse for you to enlighten them.

Together we might make a difference, together we might convince Nickelodeon or some other syndicate that more episodes of Invader Zim is worth the cost.
