  <description>Jimmy Valvano was a historic coach and died of cancer. His ESPY speech, which can be viewed on youtube if you would like is one of the most inspiring speeches of all time. Listen to it and you will have a better understanding of what this foundation is all about and why this cause is important. Always remember, "Dont' give up, don't ever give up"

If you are unsure as to whether you want to donate your money on facebook or not, you can visit the Jimmy V Foundation website at www.jimmyv.org 
and donate money there and you can donate $5 dollars to the cause and get a bracelet with the Jimmy V motto "Don't give up, don't ever give up." I promise this is an amazing cause and its definitely making progress towards finding cures for the many types of cancer.

1. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death.

2. Extensive research can lead to better treatment of cancer patients.

3. We can help by donating money to this cause!</description>
