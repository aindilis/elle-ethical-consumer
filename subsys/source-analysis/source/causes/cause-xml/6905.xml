  <description>&lt;p&gt;-Animals are routinely cut open, poisoned, and forced to live in barren steel cages for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Studies show that because of vast physiological variations between species, human reactions to illnesses and drugs are completely different from those of other animals.

&lt;p&gt;-The conditions in which the tests are carried out may undermine the results, because of the stress the environment produces in the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The laboratory environment and the experiments themselves are capable of affecting every organ and biochemical function in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-"Noise, restraint, isolation, pain, psychological distress, overcrowding, regrouping, separation from mothers, sleeplessness, surgery and anaesthesia can all increase mortality, contact sensitivity, tumour susceptibility and metastatic spread, as well as decrease viral resistance and immune response."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, due to limited funding members of the public are ultimately the ones who fund animal research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please consider supporting this cause and help fight for a law against this inhuman act and finally put an end to Animal Testing.&lt;/p&gt;

1. There is no law in the U.S. that prohibits any animal experiment.

2. Animals do not consent to being tested upon.

3. Like humans, animals have priorities, needs, preferences, emotions, and thoughts that make each one individual.

4. Laws to protect animals are only as good as their enforcement.</description>
