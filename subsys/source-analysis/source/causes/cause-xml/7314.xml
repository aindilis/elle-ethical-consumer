  <description>Hello! As a vegetarian, I decided to start a cause to get more people to become vegetarian or vegan. It's such a smart choice to make, because of all the health benefits. Did you know that vegetarians live an average of 5 to 10 years longer than (ugh!) meat eaters? Also, vegetarians save the lives of 100 animals each year! Not to mention that most Olympic atheletes are making the change (or already are) vegetarians because it gives you more energy. I mean, the only way your body can digest meat is by it rotting in your colon for 3-4 days. There are many more benefits to becoming veg, check them out at www.goveg.com !

1. Get more people to become veg!

2. Meet other vegetarians and vegans for ideas, recipes and support!

3. Saving the lives of animals!</description>
