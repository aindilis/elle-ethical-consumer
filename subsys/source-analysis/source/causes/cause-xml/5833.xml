  <description>Some people are just oblivious to whats going on around them.
They choose to ignore all the warning signs and then complain and whine when they get in shit.

You create your own reality so everything that happens to you is your own fault... take responsibility for your life and give yourself credit when credit it due!

And eat loads of chicken!


1. You create your own reality

2. Life is much bigger than just you and me

3. You are the most important person in your life</description>
