  <description>KIVA lets you lend (microfinance) to a specific entrepreneur in the developing world - empowering them to lift themselves out of poverty.

Kiva.org allows individuals to make $25 loans to low-income entrepreneurs in the developing world (microfinance). By doing so, individuals like you provide affordable working capital for the poor (money to buy a sewing machine, livestock, etc.), empowering them to earn their way out of poverty.  

It's a new, direct and sustainable way to fight global poverty, and the way I see it, I get a higher return on $25 helping someone build a future than the interest my checking account pays.  

Anyways, if you have a minute, please check out the site: http://kiva.org.
