  <description>MoveOn.org Civic Action empowers the little guy. Our 3.2 million members use cutting-edge technology and people-powered activism to make a meaningful difference on a variety of issues. 

Issues include: Net Neutrality &amp; Internet freedom, YouTube and MySpace users' rights, media reform, corporate responsibility, ensuring that presidential debate video is made legally accessible to YouTubers and the public, and getting the Democratic Party to drop right-wing Fox as host of a presidential debate.

We don't accept corporate money, and are funded by the small-donor contributions of millions of people.

1. Internet freedom must be preserved and Internet access expanded

2. The media must be a strong watchdog for the public - digging to the bottom of stories, and holding truth to power

3. The little guy deserves to be empowered -- we do that empowering through cutting-edge online organizing.</description>
