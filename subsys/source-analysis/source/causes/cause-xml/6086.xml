  <description>The Empire, guided by the dark hand of Lord Palpatine, as cast a dark cloud over the universe.  We are the ones who will stand against the shadow and bring down The Empire, restoring peace to the Universe--while using light sabers every chance we get, of course.  We also got wookies and e-woks, so suck it Palpa-suck ass.

1. Bring down The Empire

2. Restore power to The Republic

3. The superfluous use of light sabers

4. The force, bitch!</description>
