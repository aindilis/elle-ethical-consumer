  <description>We are a non-profit organization that wants to stop censorship of information and TV so that the public may make serious decisions about who they vote for. Due to last elections turn out I believe that the public has to have accurate information more than ever due to Americas political situation. Please tell your friends about us and do your part in your community to get ACCURATE and TRUTHFUL information out to the public NOT rumors or smack talk.

Thank you,

Jacob

1. That the public must know the truth so they can make an educated decision.
