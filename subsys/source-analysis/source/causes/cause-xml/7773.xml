  <description>World War II was the greatest military victory for the United States. It was an effort in which every citizen contributed and had a stake in the otcome, along the front lines and the home front. It was a war neither the United States nor our Allies could afford to lose.

Today, America is slowly saying goodbye to our "Greatest Generation" of citizens. The State of New Jersey is taking the initiative to honor and remember them by commemorating a memorial in Trenton across from the State House at Veterans Park.

Fittingly, the theme for New Jersey's WWII Memorial is "Victory". The memorial will honor and pay tribute to the courage and many sacrifices made by WWII Generation; and to celebrate the greatest victory our country has ever known.

The WWII Memorial Commission, headed by Jack McGreevey, father of Former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey and WWII Veteran himself, expected to Dedicate the completed memorial in Fall of 2005. However, funds had slown down and not enough for ground to be broken, even today, almost two years after it was supossed to be finished. So, please help honor those who gave all to defeat Fascism and Genocide in Europe and Atrocites in the Pacific.
