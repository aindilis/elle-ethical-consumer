  <description>Each week, CPS (child protective services) agencies recieve over 50,000 reports of neglect or types of Child abuse. It's not a light subject. Many aren't aware of how traumatic abuse can be to a child. It can change their life in a matter of an instant. This group is geared towards raising awareness in the matter and to make an effort to help stop abuse. If you join, we ask that you PLEASE invite ANYONE you know. This is for a good cause, just think, by doing this, you're helping kids across the nation and the world who are being abused each day. 

Thank you,
