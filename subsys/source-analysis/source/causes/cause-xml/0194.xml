  <description>It's time we all did our part to prevent the sales of conflict diamonds.  Every purchase of a conflict diamond is just fueling the war and the never-ending brutality of the people involved.  While the rest of the world wears a shiny, new diamond, the person over in Africa that dug through the soil for it is probably getting killed.

1. Demand documentation that your diamond comes from a conflict-free zone.

2. We must stop fueling the war by purchasing those conflict diamonds.

3. Educate yourself and others so we can spread the word!</description>
