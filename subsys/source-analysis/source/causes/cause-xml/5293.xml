  <description>Many young boys were soldiers or lived as refugees because of the last quarter century of war in Afghanistan. Refugee boys worked long hours selling newspapers or candy in the streets in order to feed themselves and their families and could never go to school. Now they have returned to Afghanistan and are too old to join school. Without direction for the future, they continue to fight and disrupt their families and communities.



This project will help 120 boys trade their guns in for books; they will study in Educational Learning Centers supported by CHI/AIL in Kabul and Herat. 
Boys will become literate, advance their education, and learn such skills as computers and English that will help them get jobs. Education for boys will improve Afghanistan&#8217;s economy and contribute to making the country more secure.
