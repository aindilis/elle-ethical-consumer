  <description>Almost half of all marriages now end in divorce. Often one parent becomes a visitor and one parent becomes sole parent. Either way it's a tough go and the children suffer from not having a constant relationship with both of their parents.

We want truth, justice and equality in family law.

We want presumptive equal parenting.

We are a registered not for profit society in Canada.

1. Equal parenting is the right of all children.

2. Parents are equal until proven to be otherwise.

3. Kids need both their parents.</description>
