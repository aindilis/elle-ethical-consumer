  <description>Our mission is to provide educational and leadership opportunities for disadvantaged youth in the Philippines who show a passion to learn and make a difference in society by serving others.

1. 100% operated by VOLUNTEERS, so all donations go towards education of disadvantaged students.

2. With approximately half of Filipino citizens living in poverty, education of the country&#8217;s youth is a luxury.

3. Our students will make a difference.  All you have to do is Believe.

4. Please visit our website for more information (believeinternational.org).</description>
