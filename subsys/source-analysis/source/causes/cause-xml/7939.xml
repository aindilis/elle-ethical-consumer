  <description>Our cause, our goal, is to inform the public about the misdeeds that have befallen our beloved inferiors of the momentous game of dodgeball. Due to their lack of sight and beautiful legs, they have been deemed creatures in the light, shrouded in infinite darkness due to their handicaps. Forever to be taunted, humiliated, mocked by the resounding resilience of the dodgeball.

Just imagine if you can: complete darknes surrounds you, semi-retarded thoughts course through your mind, and walking na bow-gimping your way around while trying to dodge unseen objects with your super retard hearing. Just imagine....

Some find it funny to watch the struggle between blind gimps and bouncing balls: some have been born with no soul, eg. asians. The time to act is at hand, the time to band together in unison to aid our sub-human companions who rely upon us has arrived.

Take up thy balls, and release their fury onto the opponents who belittle the non-beautiful ones. Join us now, or feel our wrath!
