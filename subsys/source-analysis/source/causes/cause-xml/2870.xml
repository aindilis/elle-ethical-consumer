  <description>Ever done something nice for someone on the spur of the moment? Or perhaps the other way around? Remember the good feeling you got afterwards?

This is why we should all make it our mission to do at least one nice thing for somebody every day. Imagine the difference it could make! 

It doesn't even have to be anything big. It could be anything, from leaving your change in the vending machine for the next person who comes along, or paying someone who looks a bit down a compliment. 

Whatever it is, do it with good intention, do it today, and don't forget to leave a comment about it to give other people ideas. Spread the word people. 
Good Luck!
