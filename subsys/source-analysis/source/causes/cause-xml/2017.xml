  <description>It's time to stop the unfair liberal media bias that plauged the airwaves in 2006. While the African-American woman who claimed to be raped got infinite amount of air time the life's she ruined got none what so ever. This only proves that media is biased agianst the players because they we wealthy, white, young men. Also the true victims are the Duke Lacrosse team themselves and the true perpetrators are the teachers who pushed students to accuse the players, the corrupt Mike Nifong, and the media who bashed the players. So rise up and join in order to bring true equality to the masses.

1. True Equallity
