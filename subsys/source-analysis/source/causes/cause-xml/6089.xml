  <description>Ashley has been diagnose with an acute lukemia in her sinuses (nose). She has currently started chemo therapy and really needs our prayers and for us to be fasting for her healing. As brothers and sisters in Christ we need to take on each other's burdens cause when one member of the body struggles we all struggle. So please keep her in your prayers and be crying out to the Lord for her healing.

1. The glory of God to be evident in this time and through this 

2. That her testimony will impact those around her and Christ will be seen in her

3. That she and her family are bestowed with God's amazing grace love and strength

4. That she may be completely healed on the Lord's time</description>
