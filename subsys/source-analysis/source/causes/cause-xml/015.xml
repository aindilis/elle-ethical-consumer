  <description>Can You Imagine...

Living in a place where bombs and bullets could come flying through your window at any moment and take the lives of your friends and family? 

Probably not.  

At a safe distance, it&#8217;s difficult to understand what everyday life is like for a normal kid in a country at war.  

CIVIC believes that civilians (people who aren&#8217;t in the military and are not fighting) injured and the families of those killed should be recognized and helped by those who harm them.  

We&#8217;re working to make that happen for all civilians caught in the crossfire of conflict.

1. To dignify the loss of human life rather than brushing it off as 'collateral damage.'

2. To better gauge what weapons and war tactics are most harmful to civilians.

3. To make sure warring parties are held responsible and know who to help and where.</description>
