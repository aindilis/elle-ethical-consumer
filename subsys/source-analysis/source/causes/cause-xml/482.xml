  <description>When I speak to you of revolution, I do not speak of cannon fire and marches, of mass protests and hunger strikes. I speak to you of the turning of perspective; the shift in ones mind allowing energy to course through apathy and artists to turn activists, encouraging citizens to turn community members.


In every conversation I have, the question is no longer How can I help? but is the stronger, humbler decree This is what I am doing to help. Allies are we; fighting on different fronts of the same war, a war against disease, violence and self-destruction.

 
So when I ask you to rise and join us as a company, I ask you as a brother in battle to find your place at our fire. It has already been laid for you. Our fire has always been burning. Today it burns brighter because you have joined us. I can see you stepping into your power. I can hear the beat of your drum. I can see the light in you.
