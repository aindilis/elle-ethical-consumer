  <description>This is just a cause that I have made up, in order to get people to try to stop bullying that may be going on in their school, or neighborhood. Just to get people to think about it, and understand that it is very wrong, and that there are many different types. 

1) Physical
2) Emotional 

These two are the most common forms of bullying. Physical, which deals with people pushing / fighting other people, and emotional is where they may say things which can hurt a person deep down.

If you join you are swearing that:

* I will not make fun of anyone.
* I will step up, and try to stop it when I see it.
* I will inform my friends about how it is wrong.


1. Bullying Must End. </description>
