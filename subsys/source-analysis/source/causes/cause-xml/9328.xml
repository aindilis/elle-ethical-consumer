  <description>-What the hell...
those bladdie bastards who wheel spin in Retief street at 2 am... no respect for the elderly. And they rev their engines aswell.
Les and I have had enough of throwing rocks, we want to amp them now.
Damn it. And they ring our bells aswell.

Bennie de Silva: "I woke to the sound of an engine revving and I heard a wheelspin which lasted for approximatel 12 minutes"

Anon: "my wifes a nurse and needs to sleep in the day"
