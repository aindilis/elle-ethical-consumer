  <description>For all those who believe the Microsoft is the root of all evil, you are not alone.

Some are content to complain about the appallingly low quality of their products, or how they literally extort money from the legions of consumers they've trapped into using their products.

We're not.

With support, we'll work actively to put an end to the Third Reich of the computer industry.

...and this isn't about the alternative platforms, such as the Mac, being better. It's about Microsoft being abhorably greedy and making, at best, third-rate products.

1. Microsoft gives capitalism a bad name.

2. Microsoft does not innovate.

3. Microsoft does not care about their customers.</description>
