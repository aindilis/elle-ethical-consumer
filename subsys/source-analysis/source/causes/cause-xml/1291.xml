  <description>The ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) is an organization devoted to fighting all things moral and logical in the name of freedom, democracy, and all that they are actually opposing. They spout sermons of tolerance and acceptance while they rabidly reject any ideas that do not agree with their own. They have a large political force, and their aggressive propaganda campaign has fooled millions into believing their lies and in doing so hurting the foundations on which the United States were built. If not stopped, they will eventually undermine the country until it crumbles to dust.

1. The ACLU must be stopped.

2. True Democracy must be saved.

3. The ACLU will destroy the USA unless it is stopped.</description>
