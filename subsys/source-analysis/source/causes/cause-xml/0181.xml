  <description>It is disturbing to think that in a free country laws exist to make being outside a crime, but it happens in the form of curfew laws. The most vulgar of status offenses, curfew laws prohibit youth from being in public during much of the night and day. 

There is no evidence that youth curfews actually stop youth crime.  Just think about it, if someone intends to go out and steal a car, do you really think he'd be worried about a curfew citation?  

If you want to stop crime, then arrest criminals - don't turn innocent young people into criminals just because of their birthdate.
