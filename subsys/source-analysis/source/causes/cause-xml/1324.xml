  <description>Hadrienne Mendonsa, who was tragically killed in an automobile accident on November 19, 2005 left us longing for some way to preserve her memory. We want to ensure her memory is something that lasts forever and continues her passions, positively impacting this world. Alumni rowers and friends came together and established the Hadrienne K. Mendonsa Memorial Fund on July 2, 2006.

To honor Hadrienne's memory by establishing endowed fund (making it permanent) that allows Hadrienne&#8217;s friends and family to support causes she cared about:
	  
	  	
by improving access and awareness of rowing
to people in need
start
	  	
by supporting research and development for endangered and protected wildlife and their habitats.

The fund is governed by a diverse board of Hadrienne&#8217;s friends and teammates that rotates through new members every year. This ensures that all of Hadrienne&#8217;s friends have the opportunity to give and support causes in her memory. Endowing it means we will be able to continue this work forever. This Board of Hadrienne&#8217;s friends then will use the interest on the endowment to award grants and scholarships to causes Hadrienne cared so deeply about&#8212;rowing, environment, and wildlife. Please be a founder of the Memorial Fund!
