  <description>We stand for abolition of nationalities and its current consequences. People have to freely decide the place of the world where they want to live, which doesn't mean that countries have not the right to limit the access to citizenship rights. It is not an acceptable standard in the twenty one century that people be marked by a nationality that seems they are condemned to be victims of any kind of illegitimate regimes.

1. Passports should be abolished

2. People have to select the country where they want to live

3. Frontiers are for governments but not for people</description>
