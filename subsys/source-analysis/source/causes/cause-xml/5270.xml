  <description>Making Strides Against Breast Cancer is the American Cancer Society&#8217;s premier event to raise awareness and dollars to fight breast cancer. More than just the name of a walk, it describes the amazing progress we&#8217;re making together to defeat this disease. 

Making Strides Against Breast Cancer is a noncompetitive walk to help fight breast cancer and provide hope to people facing the disease. Your participation will support the American Cancer Society's lifesaving research, prevention, early detection, and support programs for thousands of patients and their families. 

This is your opportunity to join your community to celebrate breast cancer survivors, educate women about early detection and prevention, and raise money to fund lifesaving research and support programs to help us reach a day when no one will have to hear the words &#8220;You have breast cancer.&#8221;  Please walk with us.
