  <description>There is no money required to do this. All that's needed is free will. The ability to step away from society and say, "Is this really what I want to do with my life? To be another robot, working on the production line of society, all just to keep this anthill running in a polite and organized manner?" We think that we're the most advanced species on earth, then why are we always running to and fro, (from work to home to restaurant to mall to home to work etc) like programmed machines?
The goal of this project is to get people thinking about how silly society is. It can be something very simple, like telling other people or even just one other person about this idea and explaining it to them so that they understand.
I don't expect many people to join. Anyway, in the end, it's your life. Enlightened or not.
