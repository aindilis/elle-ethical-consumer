  <description>Knowing that only 4 people in the state of Texas are diagnosed with Friedreich's Ataxia makes it very frustrating to know that not much research can be done. This is the most rare form of the different types of Muscular Dystrophy, both parents must have the gene for it to be able to be passed on. It is a slowly progressing disease that affects the muscles. There is no cure, but that does not mean that there will never be one. Help raise funds to donate for research to find a cure.

1. Not enough research is being done, simply because it is the most rare form of ataxia/dystrophy.

2. More time and effort needs to be put into studies of this disability.

3. There needs to be much more awareness of this disability than what there is currently.</description>
