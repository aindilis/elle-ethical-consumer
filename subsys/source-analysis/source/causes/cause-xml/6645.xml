  <description>Size zero has been linked to anorexia nervosa and bulimia as many women have to lose a large amount of weight to become so thin. The deaths of models Luisel Ramos and Ana Carolina Reston have been attributed to the Size Zero trend. Luisel Ramos, aged 22, died of a heart attack in August 2006 after apparently trying to survive on Diet Coke and lettuce leaves. Since then, Brazilian model Ana Carolina Reston too, died from the pressures of maintaining slimness; her diet was reported to consist solely of apples and tomatoes and she died from renal failure.

Conversely, models such as teenager Lily Cole, who claims to be naturally slim and healthy, have been used as examples to support the claim that size 0 can be natural and healthy.
 


There is a "growing" trend happening in fashion right now and no it has nothing to do with hem lengths, lip color or fabric style. According to Women's Wear Daily the infamous size zero demographic is no longer limited to the silver screen or the catwalk; in fact these women walk among us every day. And their numbers are swelling (pun intended)!
