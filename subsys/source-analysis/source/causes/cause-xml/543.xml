  <description>In recognition of National HIV Testing Day on June 27th, Who's Positive (http://www.whospositive.org) 

More than 25 million people have died of AIDS since the incurable disease was first recognized in 1981 and about 40 million now live with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  We know that today's youth can have an amazing impact on this cause but we need your help to not only encourage our peers to know their status but make sure they have the resources available to them to protect themselves.

Some reasons why you should know?...
# Immune system monitoring and early treatment can greatly improve your long term health.
# Knowing you are positive may help you change behaviors that would put yourself and others at risk.
# You will know whether or not you can infect others.
# Women and their partners considering pregnancy can take advantage of treatments that potentially prevent transmission of HIV to the baby.
# If you test negative, you may feel less anxious after testing.

This group supports ASG, a local AIDS Services Group in Charlottesville, VA - as Who's Positive has dropped its 501 (c)(3) status but remains active in the fight against HIV/AIDS.  Please help support them.
