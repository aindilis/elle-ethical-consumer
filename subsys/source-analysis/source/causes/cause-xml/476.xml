  <description>This project is to help those who suffered through Hurricane Katrina and continue to suffer today. We must join together to give back to them what they have lost.

1. The area needs to be restored.

2. These people deserve all the help we can give.

3. If everyone who joins invites ten friends, we will have a functioning foundation.</description>
