  <description>Someone gets a dog,some other gets a cat,another gets a tiger or a wolf.Dogs and cats (and other orginal pets bunnies and like that) are great pets,but big cats,wolfs,bears and apes are NOT suposed to be pets. They buy theme when they are small and cute,and then they grow and the needs of the animal changes.Someone get put in a too small cage and others don`t get the right food they need.FEW have a happy and good life.

Stop this animal abuse,don`t buy wild animals as pets!!!
