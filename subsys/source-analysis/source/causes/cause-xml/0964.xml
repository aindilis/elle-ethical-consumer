  <description>As we speak, millions of dollars in raw resources are siphoned off of governments in need. While international industries are richened by foreign resources, millions suffer the aftermath of their careless ventures. International industries have deceived us with false promises of riches in order to gain access to our raw resources, they steal our resources, they pollute our land, and they leave poverty and debt in their wake. We must nationalize our industries in order to fight off these corrupt capitalists. 

1. Nationalization of all oil industries.

2. Cooperation between nations in need.

3. The public has a basic right to elect their own form of government without any foreign inteference.</description>
