  <description>Never forget September 11, 2001. Many died during these terrorist attacks. No doubt that stupid assholes like Osama bin Laden were masterminds of this attack. We must muster the courage and take the fight against terrorism and the evil American liberals, who deny these terrible attacks. 

I, the leader of this group, may be a Pinoy, but I forever love America as equally as my home country.
I don't want the liberals and Democrats to destroy this country even further, so join me in the final crusade against those monsters and the terrorists that caused this tragedy! As long you love America and is willing to support George Bush's crusade against terrorism, you are welcome to join. No donations needed, if you are willing to kic


You heard me, let us fight in the name of Freedom!


1. Terrorists are the "real" evil

2. America must win

3. Bush is right</description>
