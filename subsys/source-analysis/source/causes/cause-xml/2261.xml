  <description>Relay for life is the largest fundraiser in the world and it happens at ASU MAIN every April. The event is a culmination of a yearlong effort on the part of the ASU MAIN community, their friends, parents, supporters and advocates to raise money to benefit the ACS. 

The overnight event is intended to bring together the community as a whole and someone from each formed team should be walking on the football track at all times to symbolize that cancer in whatever form, does not sleep!

While there are many relay's that go on yearly, this relay is intended for the ASU main and it's friends community...please join, start a team and help fundraise so that one day cancer will not be a problem for our generation as we age or forthcoming generations.
