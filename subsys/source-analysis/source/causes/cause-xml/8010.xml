  <description>The Imagilution is just a word. It honestly does not matter if we create a cause out of it, if we talk about it, or if we advertise for it, or if we collect money for it.

What the word stands for is what matters. The Imagilution is a revolution. It is a revolution of our imaginative powers!!!

Basically, anything is possible. We can create any reality that we desire on a personal and collective scale. Quantum physics has proven that we, the artist scientists, are the beings with the power to create.

There is no point in trying to fix 'what is wrong' with the world. There is nothing wrong. We are dreaming a dream. All we have to do is dream a new dream.

People:
We CAN CREATE NEW LAWS OF PHYSICS. We are that powerful. 

All of the beings, the mystical mythical magical beings you have met in the fairy tales and in your heart are REAL and are just waiting to join us and help us, humanity, create a new world!

Do you believe? Do you believe in your heart's deepest most impossible dreams?

Are you ready to fly?
VIVA L'IMAGILUTION!!!

1. The universe is a blank canvas

2. We are God

3. Our imaginations are the future</description>
