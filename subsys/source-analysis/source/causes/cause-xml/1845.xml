  <description>	The Minimum Wage is the lowest hourly wage that employers may legally pay to employees or workers. Its goal is to serve as a protection for workers from exploitation, and to ensure they are paid a living wage. Sadly, the value of Minimum Wage within the United States has been in steady decline since 1968. As the value decreases, its function as a safeguard against social inequity begins to fail. Steps must be taken to remedy this injustice. Studies, including one conducted by David Card and Alan Krueger of Princeton University, have concluded that any adverse affects the critics claim will occur due to raising minimum wage are frivolous. So, in summary, the depreciation of the value of the Minimum Wage is social injustice, and an attack on the rights of the working poor. The ill affects of raising the Minimum Wage are negligible. There are truly only benefits for the nation to come from a raise.
