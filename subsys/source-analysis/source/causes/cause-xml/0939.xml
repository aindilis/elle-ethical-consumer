  <description>Relay for Life is an annual event hosted by the American Cancer Society. Prior to this event, teams fundraise money for cancer research and services ACS provides to patients and the public. During the event, all participants come to together to celebrate the lives of those that have lost their battle to cancer and to support those that continue to fight their battle.
