  <description>STEM Int'l is a non-profit Christian short-term mission agency that sends about seven hundred volunteers each year to fourteen developing nations around the world. These volunteers hold orphans in Haiti, pray with HIV-infected inmates in Belize, distribute blankets in the mountains of Honduras, and provide medical care in remote villages along the Paraguay River.

Your contribution helps provide solid training, quality leaders, and thorough logistical support for these volunteers to serve most effectively during their outreaches.

STEM's mission is accomplished through volunteers who are sent by the generous donations of people like you! Thanks for joining with us in this great adventure.
