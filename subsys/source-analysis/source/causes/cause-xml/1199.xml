  <description>With rising oil prices, many complain that not enough is being done to lower prices.  In all actuality, it is the use of oil that must ultimately decline.  Regardless of whether the oil is foreign or domestic, burning fossil fuels is incredibly damaging to the environment, and there is only a limited supply available.  One day a time will come when there is no more oil left -- why not begin developing new technologies now?  By making efforts to reduce oil consumption now we can reduce the costs of cleaning up our own mess later.

4. Burning of fossil fuels contributes to global warming

5. Burning of fossil fuels emits air pollution which is damaging to the health of humans

6. The drilling of fossil fuels leads to often overlooked environmental devestation

7. Long term advantages of alternative fuels outweigh short-term development costs

8. Even without radical lifestyle changes, every person can make a difference and conserve oil with simple changes in habit (e.g., walking more, driving less, accelerating slower)

9. An end to dependence on fossil fuels will be beneficial to generations to come</description>
