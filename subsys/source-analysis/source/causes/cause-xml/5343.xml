  <description>Every year, for that past six, I have been part of the Quest Diagnostics team in the Rochester Relay for Life. This year, on the weekend of June 23-24, our team wa*s the Platinum donor and raised well over $10,000 for ACS. There is a cure out there...somewhere...we just need to be persistent and keep trying to find the answer. I don't care if you actually donate to my Facebook cause in particular, the important thing is to at least donate to some organization that benefits further cancer research. There is a benefit, however, to donating through Quest Diagnostics. For every penny donated through the entire year, Quest will make a company match and your donation will be doubled. this is great because even if you don't have much to give...a $5 donation turns into a $10 donation, a $10 donation turns into a $20 donation and so on. Think of how far along cancer research has gone already and imagine the future of cancer research and what your dollar can do for the millions affected every year. In addition to donations, I implore that you, at least once in your lifetime, attend a Relay for Life near you - especially at night for the Survivor Ceremony and the Silent Luminary Lap, it is a very emotional time - aside from that, there is fun for everyone and while you are spending your money on the activities all around you, you are raising money for a great cause!

1. There is a cure for cancer out there somewhere, and it is our job as a collective to help find it.</description>
