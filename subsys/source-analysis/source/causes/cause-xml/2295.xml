  <description>Have you ever had a homeless person beg you for your hard earned dollar so that they can buy drugs or booze? These people have a severe problem; it's called LAZINESS. Support this cause. The next time a homeless person asks you for a couple of bucks, laugh in their face and tell them what a funny clown they are. If people wouldn't give them money, they would be forced to get jobs. 

           THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA
