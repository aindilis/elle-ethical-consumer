  <description>America's CIA has been reported to have a network of "secret prisons" worldwide. People suspected of links to terrorism are kidnapped and brought by CIA "rendition flights" to these places for interrogation. 

The Council of Europe reported that "secret prisons" in Eastern Europe were being used by the CIA, and that people had been tortured there. When it was exposed, the CIA apparently moved on to other locations to continue interrogating and torturing the disappeared. 

Where are they now? 

What positive steps are being taken by our governments to ensure respect for human rights?



1. Human rights are universal.

2. We cannot standby while people are abducted and tortured in our countries.

3. Exposing details about "secret prisons" can help shut them down.</description>
