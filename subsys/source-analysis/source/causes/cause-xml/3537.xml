  <description>We are a teen lead anti-tobacco movement in West Virginia and our mission is to expose the lies that are spoken every day by the tobacco companies.

1. Smoking leads to cancer or emphazema.

2. Spit (chewing) tobacco leads to Cancer.

3. Tobacco companies care nothing about your health.

4. We are not against smokers, only the companies, and we only try to expose the truth, not attact users.</description>
