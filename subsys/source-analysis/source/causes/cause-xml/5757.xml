  <description>No argument required, everyone knows how great littering is, they are just afraid to admit it.  Littering is great for a number of reasons:

- No more taking out the trash
- No more recycling bullshit
- No more landfills
- It's a hell of a lot of fun

So stop throwing away your trash, just throw it.

1. Littering is awesome

2. We should walk up and litter next to trash cans

3. Hippies are not cool</description>
