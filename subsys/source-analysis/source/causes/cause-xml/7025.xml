  <description>Our goal is to provide clean water throughout Rwanda by funding and digging wells in each village in Rwanda.  It costs $3000.00 to dig one well that will provide clean water for up to 750 people for their lifetime.
In a country such as our where we take water for granted we do not understand just how bad things can be.  In Rwanda, children die each day due to parasites that are in the water that they are drinking.  Mothers and daughters have to spend up to half of their day - every day - to search for water to bring back home for use in cooking, drinking &amp; cleaning.

1. Clean water is a human right

2. All people must have clean water

3. People will continue to die without clean water</description>
