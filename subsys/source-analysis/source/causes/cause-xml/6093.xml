  <description>The Marshall Legacy Institute works to raise awareness about landmines and raise money to fund detection dogs that are deployed in mine stricken countries all over the world.  Help comes from huge companies, regular joes, and elementary school kids, and now it's time for US to take our stand.  Show the world that you want to help!  When you clear an area of mines you give people the opportunity to cultivate the land, build a school or a home, you give them the chance to stop living in fear!
One dog can help clear 10 times the amount of land that a manual deminer can cover in a day.  That's 1500 square meters that go back to the people.

1. we CAN help clear landmines

2. it's our world, we need to save it

3. save the world, one dog at a time</description>
