  <description>In October of 2006 we found out that my 2 year old cousin Grace was diagnosed with Rett Syndrome.  Rett Syndrome is a neurological disease and is an extreme form of Autism.  My cousin Grace is one of many girls affected by this disease and in her case she can not eat, only by feeding tube, can only say a few words, and walking as been an on and off thing for her.  She is a beautiful child with a look of confusion in her eyes as she tries to connect with you.  We had a fundraiser in May to raise money for the Rett Syndrome Researh Foundation (RSRF) to help find a cure.  In February a scientist in Europe reversed the disease that affected mice that were close to death.  Just at least join the group.  We are not looking for donations just simply an outlook of people for the cause. Please help if you can!!  Thanks!  If you would like more information you can contact me at lizcapa@yahoo.com or im me at Liz51487.
