  <description>If someone you've loved has ever dumped you, you know what I mean. 
I wish someone could create a pill that would make it all better, one dose and no more pain! 

1. Love is a delicate thing.

2. Don't hurt the people you love.

3. Be there for your friends when they're hurt.</description>
