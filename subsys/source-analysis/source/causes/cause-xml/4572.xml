  <description>This project was started in January of 2007 with 12 students from the two high schools in Sylvania, Ohio. This project is to help our generation with understanding Child Abuse. We feel that when you are educated you can never turn away and act that you don't know how to help someone being abused. We want people who are abused to know that there are people who want to help. We help teens and our peers with that first step of telling someone. Sometimes it is easier for a teen to tell another teen before telling an adult. We want to eduacate our generation and future generations of the affects child abuse has on individual people and how to look for it. If you would like to start P.E.A.C.E. at your school or in your town please contact us at PEACE51807@yahoo.com.

1. Lower the rate of child abuse in our generation.
