  <description>We seek to end the ideals of frivolity and faith governing the populace of the world.  We will make sure that man is governed by the laws for the common good of the people and by the people.  We will ensure that no deity enters his way into the minds of men when they make decisions to lead men in this life.  And most of all we will make sure that no god has power over those who do not wish it to be forced upon them
