  <description>This is a cause supporting the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  Yes, the mormons.  Whether you're a member, or just respect or admire those that are, you are welcome!

1. Christ atoned for our sins, and gave us the opportunity to repent and return

2. Joseph Smith was a true prophet that was called upon to restore the fullness of the Gospel for these latter days

3. The Church is still true

4. God still loves his children, and has not abandoned them</description>
