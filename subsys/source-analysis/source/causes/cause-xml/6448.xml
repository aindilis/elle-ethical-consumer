These are just a few of Mother Nature&#8217;s most marvelous wonders.  They are interesting to watch develop, but very dangerous and can be life altering to those in their paths.  As a natural disaster victim, I understand all too well the affects these events can have on  someone&#8216;s life.  It&#8217;s a shame that it took the Indonesian Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina to show the world how strong Mother Nature can be and how important it is to prepare for the worst.  I feel it is my duty to share my story and give some insight to others on the dangers of these disasters and how early preparation can save their lives and their families lives.  Through this group, I hope that I can provide resources to those people who have suffered in a natural disaster, provide helpful tips to preserve life and lifestyles during and following these events,  and provide a listening ear to victims who just want to share their stories.  God bless you and keep you all.
