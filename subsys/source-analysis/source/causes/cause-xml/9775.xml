  <description>we donate soccer balls to kids around the world. some have never had a real toy and each ball is a spark of hope in a village. our soccer team has been doing this event for the past two years, but our mission is to play it forward and have others help us make a difference.

1. Every child has a right to play with a real ball.</description>
