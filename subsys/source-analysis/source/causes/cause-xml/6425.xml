  <description>Too many children are being taking from their parents and put in to foster care, even adoption. They need our support. Foster careers get paid loads. But the kids need more than money. They need to belong, they need friendship, trust and they need people to to listen to them. 

1. No matter their age, children need to be listened to.

2. Children need toys and play, not talking too.

3. Most of all childen need stability. Foster care does not provide this.</description>
