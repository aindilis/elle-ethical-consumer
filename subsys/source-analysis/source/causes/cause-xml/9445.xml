  <description>We are Landon, Cody and Jordan, guys who LOVE FOOTBALL (soccer)! We are also 3 guys who live in Canada. With the next FIFA World Cup in 2010 being in South Africa we are being denied our rights as Canadians to do whatever we want! Which is to go see the FIFA World Cup in 2010. 

We all strongly believe that this is our last chance to go see a FIFA World Cup event, since we are in our prime and aren't tied down with wives! It's our last chance to paint our faces, toss on a kit and cheer our hearts out for a team that is really good at winning!! 

Our dilemma is that we won't EVER beable to afford to go to such a thing with our community first based careers! 

And..


We would love for you to help us get there!! 


We won't be just sitting on the computer and hoping for people to join..no we are going to be out fundraising and giving back to the community with our fundraisers!

Help us, Help You..by Helping us first!!


1. Anybody should be able to go to the world cup no matter how much they can't afford it!

2. WE LOVE YOU ALL!</description>
