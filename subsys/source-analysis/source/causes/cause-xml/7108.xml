  <description>Some of use express ourselves through dance, some of use express ourselves through music, and others express ourselves through Graffiti. I think our voices should be heard.

1. Graffiti is an art, and a form of expression.

2. The should allow us to do graffiti because we are going to do it anyway.

3. Tagging stuff is fun.</description>
