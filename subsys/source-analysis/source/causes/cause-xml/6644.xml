  <description>Thanksgiving of 2001, my mother found a large knot on my sisters neck.  The following Friday my sister drove home from college to go to the doctor because the knot had gotten bigger.  The doctors told my mother she had the good kind of cancer.  X-rays were done the next day to verify the disease.  My sister at the age of 18 was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  

Chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplants, the "good kind" of cancer was always quick to return.  On July 9th, 2005 she turned 22.  On the morning of Thursday July 28th, 2005 she passed on.

Hodgkin's lymphoma is not the  "good kind" of cancer to get.  There is not one person that was undergoing treatment while me sister was in the hospital that is still alive.  There is not enough funding to properly treat this disease.  

In memory and honor of those that experience a blood cancer, I am raising money for cancer research to find a better cure.  So that no one else will have to suffer as my sister did, as so many do from the treatments used today.

1. ...because no cancer, not even Hodgkins Lymphoma is the "good kind" of cancer to get.</description>
