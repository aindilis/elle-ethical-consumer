  <description>We were born with natural rights.
The right to live
The right to love
The right to choice
The right to have a fucking voice


1. The governments of the world have no right to limit your natural rights.

2. Everyone is equal and should be treated that way.

3. It's your body, you should do to it what you want</description>
  <mission>To give all people the natural rights that they were born with.</mission>
