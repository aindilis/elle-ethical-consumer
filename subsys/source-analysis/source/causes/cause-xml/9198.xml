  <description>This is basically an extension to mosh pits. Listen to a bunch of heavy metal or rock music. then get your baseball bat and go smash something. I gotta warn you though, I got sued once for hitting my neighbor with my bat. I broke two of his ribs. He hasnt spoken to me since. 

this is just for fun



but that really did happen

1. You must smash expensive things

2. You must bash people in the face

3. You must seriously harm people. Hospitalize those fuckers

4. Break anything meaningful to every adult you know.</description>
