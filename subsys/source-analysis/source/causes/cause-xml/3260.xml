  <description>Home Health Care Workers provide an incredible service to their communities.  They give the disabled and elderly a choice to stay in their own homes instead of going to a nursing home or other facility.  Unfortunately, county governments rarely want to spend the money on bettering the situation of these Care Providers, and by doing so create a 50% turnover rate, the lowest wages in the health care industry, absolutely no health benefits and little training.  This in turn endangers the people who need this care the most.  Join us in creating a more just system for Home Health Care Providers by voting to join and better fund the Wisconsin Quality Home Care Commission, which creates an employer of record and raises standards in this field.

1. The disabled and elderly have a right to choose to stay home even if they can't take care of themselves.

2. If they make this decision, they should be provided with the best care possible.

3. To create the best care possible, workers should be organized and earn the respect of the community as health care providers.</description>
