  <description>Today, education is becoming America's number one civil rights issue.  Many of America's children from lower income families are left behind due to our lacking public education system.  Superintendents and other administrators make six figures while the students they oversee are left in the dust by other thriving school districts.  This group is called to recognize that America's school will only improve when its beuacracies are removed and schools are forced to compete for students.

1. Remove local funding of public schools

2. Allow public school students to choose their school

3. Fund schools based on number of attending students

4. Allow lower income families to attain vouchers and give tax credits to families who pay for private education</description>
