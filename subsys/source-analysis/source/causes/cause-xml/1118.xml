1. A 40% decrease in Red Panda population reported in China over the last 50 years, and those in western/Himalayan area are considered to be in worse shape.

2. Red Pandas have a naturally low birth rate (usually single or twin births per year) and a high death rate in the wild.

3. In southwest China the Red Panda is hunted for its fur and especially for its highly-valued bushy tail from which hats are produced. In the areas of China, where the Red Panda lives, their fur is often used for local cultural ceremonies.</description>
