  <description>Power of One exists to help raise an awareness and funds for the amount of orphaned and abandoned children in the most populated country in the world, India.

Encounter Revival Ministries (ERM), a non-profit ministry organization, located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA. Any gift given through this cause will be received in it's entirety by ERM. They will then send their own support plus your gift directly to an orphanage in Hyderabad, India. So you can know that more than 100% of your gift is going to the needy children at our orphanages. 

My dream is for this cause is to prove the claim of it's name; to one day hold an event where the great number of members here would commit to donating $1 each for the orphans on a scheduled day. This concept of lots of people donating small amounts of money could change the world. It shows that if we all work together, the sacrifice is small, but the change can be worldwide!
