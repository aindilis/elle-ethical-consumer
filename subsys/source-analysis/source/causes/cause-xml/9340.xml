  <description>Children are the living messages we send to a time we will not see. India, by one count, has 18 million street children and over 22 million child laborers. Nearly 20% of the children 6-14 years old have no access to primary education. Less than 45% receive the immunization required to protect them from deadly illnesses. Half the children do not get enough food everyday and are chronically or acutely undernourished.

Vibha is a movement that empowers you to make a difference. We aim to ensure that every underprivileged child attains his or her right to education, health and opportunity.
