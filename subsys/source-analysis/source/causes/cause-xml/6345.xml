  <description>"What my life is really like&#8230;&#8230;Well from age 11 after going to slaughterhouse I have never been able to really be friends with anyone because all pretending aside there has always been this wall and uncomfortableness that they feel around me and vise versa because they always feel my empathy toward animals especially when they eat animals (I don&#8217;t ever like calling it some generic name like meat to soften it up for people). 

For many years now I just can&#8217;t fake it anymore. I never did form any real friendships ever because of my beliefs nor any serious male relationships either. I find it absurd that my neighbours dislike me so much for loving all animals and that my own guy is the worse of them all. It's unbelievable that me and other people should have to be so lonely and be treated like leopards for respecting all life.
