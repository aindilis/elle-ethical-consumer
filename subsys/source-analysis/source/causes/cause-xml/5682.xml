  <description>Child Sexual Abuse is prevalent all over the world, yet is shrouded in a conspiracy of silence. We strive to break the silence and combat with CSA and Incest in the most effective manner possible. This is an effort towards the prevention of CSA and also the healing of people who have been through this traumatic and often confusing experience. Survivors face social stigma, personal emotional/physical/psychological problems, and a range of other issues which need to be dealt with. We are geared towards making survivors resilient and able to rise above their abuse.



1. A child has the right to be protected.

2. The silence surrounding child sexual abuse must be broken.

3. Action oriented approaches to combat CSA must take effect.</description>
