  <description>SAFER is the only organization working exclusively to educate the public about the fact that marijuana is safer than alcohol both for the user and for society. 

Alcohol prohibition is widely recognized as a dismal failure. Despite marijuana prohibition being an equal or greater failure, it somehow maintains public support. Once the public comes to accept the fact that marijuana is safer than alcohol, support for marijuana prohibition will crumble. 

SAFER carries out its mission by conducting educational activities and earning on-message media coverage. SAFER's lobbying arm, the SAFER Voter Education Fund, supports local and state ballot initiatives. These campaigns provide extensive opportunities to generate news coverage while actually amending local and state marijuana laws.

1. Marijuana is safer than alcohol to both the user and to society.

2. Our government should not punish adults -- let alone make them criminals -- for simply using a substance that is safer than alcohol.

3. It's time we stop driving people to drink and start allowing them to make the safer choice to use a less harmful substance</description>
