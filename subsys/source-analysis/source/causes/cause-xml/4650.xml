  <description>Alright, so he killed Dumbledore. However, do you honestly think that Dumbledore would have trusted him so much, only to be tricked? Come on people!

Besides, I don't think JK Rowling would be that obvious about things.

Snape was Dumbledore's man through and through! Therefore, we are here to stand by him...unless he ends up being evil in the seventh book. 

I'll probably stand by him either way.

1. Snape is not evil.

2. Snape killed Dumbledore for some reason besides aiding Voldemort, which Dumbledore was aware of.

3. We will be proved correct when the 7th book comes out.</description>
