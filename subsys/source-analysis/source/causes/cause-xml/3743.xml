  <description>This is a Group for people who want to show that after that last three hundered years of Death, Rape, Distruction and Attempted "Asimilation" of Native Peoples into the "Canadian" Society, The way this Cause is going to work is we need large numbers to get the word out there! tell your Friends and Family, get as many people as you can onto the bad wagen. 

Do you really need a 15 year old in BC Canada to really start somthing like this? 

You can decide weather or not you can contemplate the fact that, we as a strong Native People's have had the last 20,000 years of History here, and the New people that call this place home have only been here since 1600bc.......

Current Issues faceing us,

The Seal Hunt, 

Native's have used seals as a source of  food for countless years, And know this tradishional food is under threat by people that feel that just beacause they put out photos of Baby Seals being killed that they have to stop this tradishion. 

On that subject, we do not support Mass killing, but we are dead serious about leting the hunt continue!

1. Prevent the enviromentalist's fron stoping the seal hunt</description>
