  <description>Tigers are being killed all over the globe to be used in traditional chinese medicine and for exotic pets.  

Tiger parts can easily be replaced by herbs but the chinese still use it in their medicine.  Tiger skin is also sold on the 'Black market' and is bought for thousand of dollars.  If we stop buying them the poachers will no longer kill them!

Tigers are amazing animals and are the biggest of all the big cat species.  They play and important pert in the ecosystem by cutting down the amount of herbovoires in their habitat, thus providing more food and space for furturre genereations.  If the tiger becomes extinct many ecosystems will collapse.

Save the tiger and save many other species.  When the buying stops the killing can too!  Don't we want these magnificent animals to be around for our grand-children?
