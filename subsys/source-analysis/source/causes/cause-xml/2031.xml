  <description>  UNICEF is a global organization that focuses on helping the world's children through immunizations, health, sanitation, girl's education, AIDS/HIV programs, and protection in conflict zones. The University of North Carolina-Greensboro chapter was started in Fall 2004 and continues to raise awareness in the local community. 

UNICEF is out to change the world for children and with children&#8212;vaccination by vaccination, blanket by blanket, biscuit by biscuit, book by book. In most of America, these things are considered completely ordinary. But in many parts of the developing world, they can save a child's life.

UNICEF is unique among world organizations and unique among those working with young people. As a global movement, we use our authority to influence decision makers and diverse partners to turn the most innovative ideas into reality. In 156 countries and territories, UNICEF's field staff uses hard-won expertise to meet the challenges facing children and those who care for them.
