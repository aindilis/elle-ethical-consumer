  <description>I pick this awareness, because my husband has been told he has it. So i am trying to bring about an awarness of this cause because numbers are rising for people that smoke or inhale second hand smoke. It is killing thousands of people. i would like to see the survivors rise instead of the death tolls. I feel we need more funds and research for this.

1. help bring the death toll down

2. to come up with a cure

3. and raise funds for more research</description>
