  <description>Welcome to Americans for the Arts Action Fund&#8217;s ArtsVote2008 website. Our mission is to secure bold, new policy proposals in support of the arts and arts education in America from candidates during the 2008 Presidential campaign.

ArtsVote is a national initiative to help the arts impact the presidential election. In New Hampshire, the Arts Action Fund has partnered with New Hampshire Citizens for the Arts (NHCFA) to identify, educate, train, and mobilize likely arts voters to help influence candidates to take strong positions for the arts.

This site is designed to provide relevant information to advocates and campaign staff who are working on arts and arts education issues. The links in the left column will provide you with campaign news; national, regional and local research information; and facts and figures about the arts. This site will be updated regularly with comprehensive and timely information, ranging from suggested arts-related proposals to economic data and ArtsVote events and activities.
