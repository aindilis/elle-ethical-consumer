  <description>When a member of a herd is attacked, the other zebras stand by, striving to do nothing to prevent harm to their fellow zebra.  No zebras, thus, refers to the fact that we must not act as they do when faced with the realities of rape and sexual assault.  We must stay silent; speaking up is imperitive to sexual assault awareness and education.  

1. One in six American women are victims of sexual assault, and one in 33 men.  Our goal is to bring awareness to the serious and frequent nature of many forms of abuse.

2. Educating men and women on how to handle incidences of rape and sexual abuse and give them the strenth to report thier attacks.

3. All donations to benefit Joyful Heart Foundation and RAINN</description>
