  <description>Rum was the life sustanance of pirates and drunkards for centuries. Now, in this time, the most precious substance in the universe is the rum. The rum extends life. The rum expands consciousness.

Although it is referred to as "alcohol" and can be mixed with food, rum is indeed a spirit in the drinking sense, its use being physically addictive and having intense psychotropic effects. Rum is also a powerful entheogen, which suitably trained adepts can use to initiate clairvoyant and precognitive trances, and access racial memory. A rum user, once accustomed to regular consumption of the substance, is thereafter compelled to continue using it for the rest of his or her life, as the sudden discontinuation of its use will induce excruciating withdrawal symptoms, followed by death. Taken daily, however, rum can extend its user's lifespan by hundreds of years.
