  <description>Stop It Now! believes that all adults must accept the responsibility to recognize, acknowledge and confront the behaviors that lead to the sexual abuse of children. We offer adults tools they can use to prevent sexual abuse - before there&#8217;s a victim to heal or an offender to punish.

1. Child sexual abuse can be prevented, before a child is ever harmed.

2. Adults and communities are most responsible for taking prevention actions.

3. Effective prevention requires that help is available for everyone involved.</description>
