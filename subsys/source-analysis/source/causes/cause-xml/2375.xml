  <description>Every year billions of farm animals are painfully slaughtered all for some extra cash. Unfortunately the day of their death is probably the best day of their lives. After being slaughtered they will no longer have to suffer and be tortured.

The Certified Humane Raised and Handled (CHRH) program is a program by humane Farm Animal Care designed to set standards for free range farms. This means any product you buy with a CHRH label on it came from a farm that kept its animals well being in mind for the entire span of that animal's life. These animals were raised in an open area free of cages.

1. Animals do not need to suffer in order for humans to eat.

2. Humans do not have the right to torture other animals.

3. Animals that are raised on farms should be treated with respect and should go through as little pain possible during slaughter.</description>
