  <description>On May 6th, 2004, after five-year trial, The Criminal Court in Benghazi sentenced to death five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor, after finding them guilty on the charges of intentional infection of 426 Libyan children with the HIV virus. The sentence will be executed by a fire squad. The compelling testimony about the medics&#8217; innocence by the world&#8217;s top AIDS experts has triggered sharp criticism and condemnation of the verdict. The European Union, The United States State Department and various international NGOs have already urged Libya to denounce the unjust and unfounded verdict. Various support and encouragement for an appeal process have already been expressed. The trial is still going on as of October 2006, but we need to help free the Bulgarian nurses from that prison because they have been there since 1998.

1. Free the Bulgarian nurses and return them home to their families.</description>
