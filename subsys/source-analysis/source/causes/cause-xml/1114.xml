  <description>A dinosaur of the Cold War era, the U.S. imposed embargo cannot be justified in today's global economy.  While the travel ban infringes the rights of all Americans to travel freely, families suffer while the economic embargo only hurts the Cuban people and gives the Castro government a continued stronghold over its people.  Furthermore, American businesses are missing out while other countries such as China are beginning to heavily invest in the island rich in natural and human resources.  This group additionally opposes the embargo because it is a violation of international customary law and specific trading agreements.

1. Cuba is not a threat to United States national security

2. All humans have the right to travel freely

3. Embargoes do not work, instead we favor engagement and cooperation</description>
