  <description>Children, Incorporated partners with existing facilities like schools and community centers to provide support to impoverished children.  We also support low-income young adults who are pursuing higher education.  With assistance from our sponsors, CI donates food, clothing, school supplies, medical services, school fees, and other necessities to thousands of children throughout the world.
