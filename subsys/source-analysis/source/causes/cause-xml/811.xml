  <description>Psychedelics such as lsd, psilocybin, mescaline and countless others have been giving it's users religious experiences for thousands of years. These experiences could relate to an already existing religion such as christianity, judaism, catholic, etc but they also allow new experiences where the user develops his or her own beliefs about our existence, afterlife, and many other aspects of life and death.

I started this to spread the word and promote the respectful use of psychedelics in regards to religion.

1. Psychedelics allow users to develop their own religious beliefs </description>
