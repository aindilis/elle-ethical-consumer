  <description>Project Agape is funded by venture capital, and you know what that means. It only exists for profit; when you donate money to causes through it (as happens when you donate on Facebook), Agape takes some of that money for those venture capitalists (4.5% of each donation is taken, 1.5% for Agape and 3% for Justgive.org). Good trick, eh?

But don't let that discourage you from donating to good causes. You can still donate; just don't do it through Facebook. Look at where the money for a given cause is donated, go to that organization's website (for instance, if you wanted to donate money to a healthcare organization, you would visit http://www.hcfama.org ), and donate directly to the organization. It may take a couple more minutes, but knowing that greedy middlemen aren't taking a cut makes it worth it.

1. Don't use Facebook to donate to causes

2. Don't use Project Agape to donate to causes

3. Donate directly to the causes by visiting their websites</description>
