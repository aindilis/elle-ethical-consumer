  <description>Established in 1975, the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA) is the &#8220;lobbying&#8221; arm of the National Rifle Association of America. ILA is committed to preserving the right of all law-abiding individuals to purchase, possess and use firearms for legitimate purposes as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

ILA&#8217;s ability to fight successfully for the rights of America&#8217;s law-abiding gun owners directly reflects the support of NRA&#8217;s more than 4 million members&#8212;a number that has more than tripled since 1978. When restrictive &#8220;gun control&#8221; legislation is proposed at the local, state or federal level, NRA members and supporters are alerted and respond with individual letters, faxes, e-mails and calls to their elected representatives to make their views known.
