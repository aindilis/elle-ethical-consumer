  <description>RIGHT NOW in Haiti, a system of slavery exists that targets Haiti's most vulnerable members of society: the children of the poor.

The restavek system results when a parent cannot provide a child with his or her basic needs - food, clothing, and education - and searches for a household that will agree to provide for these needs.

The price: indefinite domestic service in a household that cannot assure the protection of the child's rights, especially, the child's right to education.

Over 300,000 children in Haiti, or one child out of every ten, are already restaveks.

In Fond des Blancs, a grassroots committee called COSEDERF has organized itself to work for the complete elimination of the restavek system in this region of rural Haiti by working to provide each child in Fond des Blancs with free primary education.

1. Haitian parents should be able to care for their children, providing them with food, shelter, clean water, and guidance.

2. Haiti leaders should fulfill Haiti's obligations to provide free compulsory education to all of its children.

3. Haiti's allies, in particular the United States should support community efforts to end child slavery in Haiti.

4. All children in Haiti have the right to live and grow with freedom and dignity.</description>
