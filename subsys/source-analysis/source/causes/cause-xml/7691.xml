  <description>Since 1999, Falun Gong practitioners in China have been systematically persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party.

There are more than 3,300 known deaths from torture. Between 200,000 and one million people have been illegally sent to forced labour camps without trials.

Falun Gong is a peaceful qigong and meditation practice based on the universal principles of truth, compassion and tolerance.

It is practised freely in more than 70 countries by over 100 million people. All except its country of origin - China.

The torture, genocide, and organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners by the Chinese Communist Party must stop, with the perpetrators brought to justice.

The world needs truth, compassion and tolerance.
