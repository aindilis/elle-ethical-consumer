  <description>This cause is dedicated to protecting and conserving the wetlands. Donations help fund clean-up projects, research and education, and helps set aside protected areas where endangered species of frogs can breed and live.

1. Wetlands are sensitive areas that must be protected.

2. Frogs are integral to controlling insect populations and disease.

3. People must take responsibility for protecting these environments.</description>
