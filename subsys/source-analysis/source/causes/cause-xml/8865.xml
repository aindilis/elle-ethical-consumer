  <description>The Australian Greens, commonly known as The Greens, is the Green political party in Australia. The party has its eastern Australian origins in the Franklin River Dams campaign in Tasmania in the 1980s, and in Western Australia arising from concerns about nuclear disarmament. Its political platform now extends beyond environmental concerns to issues of the peace movement, grassroots democracy and social justice.

"Our vision is for a fair, independent and sustainable Australia."
