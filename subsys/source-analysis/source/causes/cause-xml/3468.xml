  <description>We are here to attempt to ensure that though Pluto has recently been diagnosed with dwarfism, it will not have to face adversity from mankind or the other planets. We want to ensure that Pluto is not discriminated against.

1. Pluto should be treated like any other planet.

2. People should not descriminate against Plantets based on dwarfisms.</description>
  <mission>Ensure that Pluto is treated the same as all the other planets, regardless of its dwarfism.</mission>
