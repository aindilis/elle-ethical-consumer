  <description>The majority of the youth who live in rural areas of Nicaragua are not able to attend high school because of the high costs of transportation into the city where the school is located.  The Nicaraguan Transportation Scholarship will cover the costs of transportation and needed school supplies for youth in four surrounding communities of San Ramon, in the district of Matagalpa, Nicaragua.   
During my time in Nicaragua, I spent each day traveling to one of four communities, getting to know the high school students, their families and the poverty they faced.  
It was drawn to my attention by the woman of the communities, that there was a strong need for a scholarship which could allow the many teenage youth to remain in school.  Because of the community&#8217;s grade schools which cover education only up to 8th grade, students are educated till they need to attend the high school located in San Ramon. Currently there are only a few students who are able to afford the transportation cost, most families usually very large, can&#8217;t afford to send all of their children to San Ramon because it is yet hard enough for them to afford notebooks, pencils, and shoes for their kids.
