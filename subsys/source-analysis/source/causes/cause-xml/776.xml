  <description>America for far too long now has been hampered by partisan politics at the expense of the American people.  Important reforms and improvements in America that need to be made.  Due to partisan politics and personal gain these things have failed to be done.  We have rising gas prices at an almost constant rate, an infrastructure that needs to be updated and better mantained, and important social problems that need to be addressed.  Social Security is projected to go bankrupt, the world has lost much respect for us, and the President is waging a war despite popular sentiment against it.  They way to do this is for our president and congress to set aside their party differences and do what is best for America.  

1. The American Government is for the people not party politics.

2. Limit of Congressional Terms to 12 years max

3. To make our representatives in Congress more accountable to the American People.</description>
