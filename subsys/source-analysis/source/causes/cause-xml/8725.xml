  <description>This group is to support those who stand by day in and day out waiting to go and save lives. During 9/11 since the NY Firedepart and NY EMS are in one building the firefighters out shined the EMT's, when in reality they were there to but they just got counted in. Not taking anything away from the firefighters but the EMTS were there and died to save lives as well.

1. Not to take anything away from them but EMT's are dimmed by doctors and nurses and even firefighters and it's time we give them support as well</description>
