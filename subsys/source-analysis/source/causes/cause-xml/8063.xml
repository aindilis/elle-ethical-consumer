  <description>I just found out that nothing actually gets donated to my bunny from this cause, so this is now pointless. I can't shut down this cause, so I'm now just saying it's for other bunnies, I guess.

  <mission>To save other bunnies besides mine because no money comes from this cause to help my bunny with the tumor. Hopefully other bunnies can be saved, though!</mission>
