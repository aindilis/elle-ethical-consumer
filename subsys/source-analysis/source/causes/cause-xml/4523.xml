  <description>Inspired by what happened to Kelsey Smith, who was abducted from a public place in broad daylight, I am attempting to start this movement. AW.A.R.E. which stands for 
ALWAYS WATCHING, ALERT, REACTIVE, EDUCATED

I propose that we all pledge to be watch out for situations where other people, complete strangers even, may need our help. 
I propose that we all take a moment to become more alert, stop and remind ourselves that there are others around us who may need our help. 
I propse that we all pledge to be reactive and helpful, even if it means making a fool out of ourselves or looking silly. That's a small price to pay if it actually saves someone's life.
I propose that we attempt to educate our children in a way that teaches them to protect themselves.

There are more people who desire a safe, protective environment than those who seek to do harm. The majority must speak and being part of AW.A.R.E. will honor the memory and spirit of those who have been victimized and hopefully make us an interactive society bent on preventing another senseless death.

1. Everyone is responsible for the safety and security of the human race.

2. One person can save another person by a small amount of concern.</description>
