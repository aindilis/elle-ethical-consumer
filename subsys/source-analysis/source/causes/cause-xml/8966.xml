  <description>The Vision of Children Foundation is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization that focuses on funding research as well as supporting education and outreach services for rare genetic vision disorders. The Foundation was established in 1991 by Samuel A. Hardage, Chairman &amp; CEO of Woodfin Suites Hotels, and his wife, Vivian after their son was born with Ocular Albinism, a genetically-caused, visually debilitating condition. Recognizing that there was no research being directed at curing this condition or minimizing its impact, the Hardage family and the Vision of Children Foundation set out to find a cure for Ocular Albinism and other hereditary vision disorders.
