  <description>We want to Stop Bad Hair Weaves and the idiots who get it done.

1. The bad weaves must end immediately.

2. You must maintain &amp; care for your tracks &amp; weave. This means it shouldn't be fallin' off yo head gril!

3. If you're 5'4, your weave shouldn't be 6 feet long, okay?</description>
