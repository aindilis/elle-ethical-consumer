  <description>The AMBER Alert Program, named for 9-year-old Amber Hagerman, is a voluntary partnership between law-enforcement agencies, broadcasters, and transportation agencies to activate an urgent bulletin in the most serious child-abduction cases. Broadcasters use the Emergency Alert System (EAS) to air a description of the abducted child and suspected abductor. This is the same concept used during severe weather emergencies. The goal of an AMBER Alert is to instantly galvanize the entire community to assist in the search for and safe recovery of the child. 

However, the AMBER Alert Program is not enough. Please help the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children find our missing children and bring them home.

1. We should do all that we can to ensure that parents, grand parents, and everyone locate their missing children.</description>
  <mission>Our mission is to raise awareness for the children that have been abducted, and to do everything we can to bring them home.</mission>
