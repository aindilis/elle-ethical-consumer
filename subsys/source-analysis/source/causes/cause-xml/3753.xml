  <description>This is a ceremony for our friend and sister, Ibukun Olaitan Adeniyi who we lost in a ghastly car accident on the 13th of May 2007.

Since some of us could not make it for her burial, lets make it for her memorial service, and pay our last respect to our lost friend.

We still mourn her, but most of all celebrate her life. IBK might b out've sight but shes still in our hearts and her legacy would never die...  IBK 4 LIFE!!
