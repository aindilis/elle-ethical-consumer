  <description>The time is near
The light (global awareness), 
is brighter than ever before 
The greed / lies / hate ... 
Must End ...

Awareness creates, sustainability

Sustainability is easy ...
Will you give, more than you take ?

Will you use your power .........
with the pretext of giving ?

Will you make informed decisions .........
with the pretext of giving ?

Will you commit to accountability .........
with the pretext of giving ?

Will you help save the World 


1. Are you willing to Help save the World, or just yourself ??

2. Will you dig deeper, and create a base of knowledge on 'your own' findings; or rather let the "Fear Media", create your opinion, for you ??

3. Will you be strong, or will you rather parish; because, the truth, was too much to listen to ??

4. Will you close your eyes and listen with your whole being, to determine truth ??  Or, will you let mind relfex (auto-pilot), lead you to 'your end' ???</description>
