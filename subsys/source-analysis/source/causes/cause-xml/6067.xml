  <description>300+ Mile Bike Ride around Southern Wisconsin to raise awareness for AIDS and AIDS Network of Wisconsin.  3-day long tour of Wisconsin country-side with an incredible team of riders and CREW!

Our goals are to provide a ride that is a substantial challenge for all levels of riders, but is at the same time fun and safe. Educate the community, raise awareness, and teach tolerance about HIV/AIDS. And finally, raise the highest possible return to AIDS Network.
