  <description>I don't have any kids nor do I particularly like people all that much so what do I care if the planet goes to hell.  We must run our cars all night in the driveways to emit more exhaust and bring back aerosol sprays.  After a certain number of participants have joined, we'll search out Larry David's wife and give her a mini tree.  

1. run our air-conditioners 24 hours a day

2. get rid of any natural green spaces i.e. Vondelpark and Central Park

3. drill for more oil everywhere

4. kill tree hugging hippies</description>
