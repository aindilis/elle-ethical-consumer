  <description>The Immune Deficiency Foundation (IDF) is the national patient organization dedicated to improving the diagnosis and treatment of primary immunodeficiency diseases through research, education and advocacy. 

In the United States, more than 250,000 people are diagnosed with primary immunodeficiency diseases and thousands more go undetected.  Although relatively rare and often difficult to diagnose, there are 130 different primary immunodeficiency diseases.  While not contagious, these diseases are caused by hereditary or genetic defects, in which part of the body's immune system is missing or functions improperly.  Primary immunodeficiency diseases can affect anyone, regardless of age or sex.

People with primary immunodeficiencies live their entire lives more susceptible to infections---enduring recurrent health problems and often developing serious and debilitating illnesses.  Fortunately, with proper medical care, many patients are able to live fulfilling and independant lives.&lt;br&gt;
