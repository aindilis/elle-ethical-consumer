It is hard to belive but there are  people who dont know about how awesome it is to "rock out." Rockers need to band together to make sure people know how to rock out. Either by blaring metal in your car with the windows down, or by making your neighbors move because your stereo is too loud, This group is too preserve classic rock  by showing others how awesome classic rock is.
