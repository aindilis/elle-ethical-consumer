  <description>ATC is still working to provide a foundation for future learning success by ensuring that all first and second graders in ACPS can read at or above grade level by the end of second grade. We continue toward that goal through one-on-one tutoring sessions at nine (out of thirteen) local elementary schools.

Since our beginning, ATC has served over 800 students identified as needing assistance in reading. We know by pre and post testing that, on average, these students have progressed "one year, two months" in reading ability in the eight months of tutoring they receive. Most of the students that receive tutoring do not read at grade level at the beginning of the school year, but tutoring results in 80 percent reading at or above grade level at the end of the school year.

ATC has incorporated and received tax-exempt 501c3 status. As a result we are able to receive tax-deductible contributions from individuals, organizations, businesses, etc.
