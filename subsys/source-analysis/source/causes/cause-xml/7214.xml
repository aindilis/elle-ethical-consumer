  <description>The campaign will highlight Right To Play&#8217;s work to customers through in-store displays and video footage in over 300 adidas stores and to the wider public through window displays on high streets in major cities.  At the centre of this campaign is a new limited edition, World Cup redesign of Right To Play signature Red Ball. This special mini ball will be on sale in adidas stores and online and adidas will donate 100% of the proceeds from the sale of every mini red ball to Right To Play. 

We want to inspire customers to support Right To Play and join the growing movement behind the red ball. The red ball is Right To Play&#8217;s symbol and the symbol of change through sport. In our projects around the world the red ball is recognized - by our coaches, and the children and communities we touch - as a symbol of learning, hope, health and happiness. 

Zidane will help this campaign to reach even further - using his voice, and the magnetism of this red ball - he will help Right To Play reach out to sports lovers everywhere and encourage them to recognize and support both Right To Play and sport as a tool for development, health and peace.
