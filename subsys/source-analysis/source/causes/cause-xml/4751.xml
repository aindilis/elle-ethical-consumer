  <description>The purpose of Live Now is to serve as the philanthropy committee of the Black Student Association at the University of Memphis. This committee's mission is to: raise money for the Hope House Day Care in Memphis, TN, work closely with the existing committees in our BSA and spread HIV/AIDS awareness on the University of Memphis campus and Memphis community. This committee will work very closely with the Special Events and Community Service committees in BSA, but will incorporate ALL BSA committees in its endeavors. Live Now is the official philanthropy committee of The University of Memphis' Black Student Association, but IS NOT LIMITED TO BSA MEMBERS. Live Now encourages ALL UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS STUDENTS to get involved to help participate in events to raise money for the Hope House and spread awareness about this completely PREVENTABLE disease. If you are interested in joining PLEASE send a message via MySpace or e-mail: livenow.uofm@gmail.com and cdgrffth@memphis.edu. If you don't know what the Hope House is, check out the official website at www.hopehousedaycare.org!!! The more exposure this committee gets the more active participation it will receive, and without participation a committee CANNOT WORK. Remember, THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS CHANGE IS AWARENESS!
