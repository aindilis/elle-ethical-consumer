  <description>The rate at which people fish in the Atlantic Ocean is much bigger than the growth of the population of fishes. This means that there are less and less fish in the Oceans every year. By 2050, scientists expect that there will be no more fish in the Ocean if the fishing rate continues at this rate.

1. Save the Fishes

2. Don't fish too much

3. If your fishing for fun and not for food, put the fish back in the lake</description>
