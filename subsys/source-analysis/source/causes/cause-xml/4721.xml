  <description>Invisible Youth is a growing network that provides resources and support for homeless youth, at risk youth, their families and related organizations.

We do this, every day, in cities across America. We carry out our mission through our partner organizations and volunteers who go to the streets in order to find, stabilize and otherwise help homeless and at risk youth improve their lives.

Our focus goes beyond street outreach and extends to deterrence and resource programs that we provide to the communities and via the internet. But all facets of our mission are guided by that our volunteers shall tell kids they care about them and then, at every point, prove it.

1. Homeless and at risk youth deserve a home.

2. These children are our future so it's up to us to help them.</description>
