  <description>why have to pay the same rates for consumer products? what happened to the honest haggle or barter between two human beings?

they say pirates were bad people but really if life is a journey as it is said, then you should do what you can to survive that journey...and if it means to take what you can and give nothing back...why not?

damn the man, screw the system, obey your moral thought...it shouldn't be about what a man can or cant do... it should be about what a man can do without being caught...

who says government and globalization is right?

1. Bring back Pirates!

2. take what you can!

3. give nothing back!</description>
