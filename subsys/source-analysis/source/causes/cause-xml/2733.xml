  <description>&lt;big&gt;This cause is in support of the &lt;b&gt;Snow Leopard Trust&lt;/b&gt;...the largest and oldest organization working solely to protect the endangered Snow Leopard and its Central Asian habitat.&lt;/big&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I personally have been a supporter of this amazing organization for some time and would like to spread the word about all they do through tremendous efforts to help save our world's Snow Leopards.

&lt;b&gt;"I think the planet is richer for having an animal like the Snow Leopard, so I'd like to see us keep it around." - Helen Freeman, ISLT Founder&lt;/b&gt;




1. The protection of snow leopards and their habitat, involving local communities in this effort.

2. An improved quality of life for the members of the community.

3. Develop programs that have a path to becoming self-sufficient &#8211; where after a time it is no longer dependent on donor dollars.

4. The results of the program must be verifiable through monitoring programs.</description>
