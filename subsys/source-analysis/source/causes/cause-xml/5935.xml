  <description>Schools everywhere are banning personal music devices being out during school. This is not only during class, but in the hallways and before and after school starts. There are way worse things than having a song in your pocket, and schools should be worrying about the bigger problems, not how students choose to spend their time between classes when it's doing something as harmless as listening to music.

1. Music is part of some students' personality; taking it away is taking away a part of them.

2. Music can be used as an alternative to caffeine to wake up in the morning, and earbuds won't stunt your growth.

3. Teachers have no right to take away something that's not doing them or anyone else any harm, like a music device between classes.</description>
