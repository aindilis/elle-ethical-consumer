While community care and development is the broad title of what we do, our work is specifically focused on widow and orphan care, a volunteer program, and various empowering partnership projects. We seek to empower individuals to transform their community.

In all of this we long to see the incredible love, compassion, grace and mercy of God made manifest in hurting places and hurting people. To continue to get a grasp of who we are, we invite you to read our vision and mission statement and view our ethos.  Also read through our statement of faith and biblical mandate to understand the foundation of Africa Revolution

1. Create a bridge the spans the gap between the global community and those suffering in Africa.

2. Facilitate tangible channels of compassion and action on a grassroots level.

3. Empower, equip, and develop these communities by coming alongside local churches in Africa whom are radically serving their communities.</description>
