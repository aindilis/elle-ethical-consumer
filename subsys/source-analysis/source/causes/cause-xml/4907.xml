  <description>Our system is broken in several ways:

- Third parties are systematically excluded by the current duopoly.  This could be fixed, or at least remedied, by public election financing and instant runoff voting.

- Voters are disenfranchised, by voter fraud and voter caging, among other deplorable practices.

- Electronic voting machines using closed-source technology prevent the electorate from exercising its right to oversee and adjudicate the fairness of our elections.

- The electoral college ensures that only a few "swing states" receive significant attention from Presidential candidates; moreover, the EC ensures that a Presidential vote in a more populous state, such as California or New York, has significantly less impact than one from a less populous state such as Wyoming or Idaho.

1. The American electoral system is broken.

2. It must be fixed.</description>
