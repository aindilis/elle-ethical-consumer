  <description>The purpose of the mission is to provide a life in residence with quality meals, a self-help work program that provide the individual residents with the opportunity of turning their lives around and getting back to the mainstream of society. 

As it has been discovered over the years, homelessness is not confined simply to those people who are substance abusers or have mental problems, but indeed effects people of all ages, backgrounds and races. The employed homeless is an example. People are working, but are unable to afford the high cost of housing in many large metropolitan areas. 

This organization is a "transitional housing program" that is made to help those have a second chance at life and to lend a helping hand to those looking for a change of life and some grace.

1. Everybody deserves a second chance.
