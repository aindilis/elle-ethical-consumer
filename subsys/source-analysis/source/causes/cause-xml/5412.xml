  <description>I know that there is a God...He is not in the holy spirit that we pray to...He isn't written about in religious texts...He is someone who is a part of our lives...Whom we live for...Because of whom we live...

The above written text is from the film titled "BLACK", directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. I worked on this film as an Assistant Director and after having experienced this journey I have been inspired to bring up this cause.

Can you imagine what it is like to be Deaf-Blind, to be surrounded by a deafening silence, to be in a world that is BLACK.

Deaf-Blind people cannot see, nor hear, nor speak, they inhibit a world of infinite black, of a seamless, endless void where nothing reaches them and they reach nothing. Thier world is frightening in its complete remoteness. On the sheer will of thier ferocious rage against destiny, they struggle to stay afloat in the impenetrable whirlpool thier life has become.

Thier devastating isolation is filled by thier teachers who BRING THEM TO THE LIGHT by teaching them how live and communicate.

I bring up this cause in front of you to help support The Deaf-Blind and thier teachers...

1. Help Deaf-Blind people

2. Support thier teachers

3. Support thier schools</description>
