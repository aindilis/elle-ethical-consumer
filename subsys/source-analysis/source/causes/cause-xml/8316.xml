  <description>We must convince the goverment to invest in poor area's around the world, like parts of Africa. Crime violence terrorism and war all stem from poverty and resentment. If the governments of the countries of the west invested $1000 of tax money per tax payer for just a single year, it would create a total of around $1 trillian (1 billion people x 1000). That is enough money to turn africa into a developed country, to create businesses and universities and hospitals. We can afford this and if it were us, we would want them to do something to help.
