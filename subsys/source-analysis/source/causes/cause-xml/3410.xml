  <description>Dare2 is a youth development charity working with marginalised young people in UK, creating opportunities for personal, social and spiritual development.  
&#8220;Our mission is to be at the heart of a professional community that
offers experiential learning to marginalised young people
enabling them to make the best life choices
and fulfil their potential.&#8221; 
We are committed to a partnership model in working with young people. That means we work with community youth organisations and schools rather, than the young people themselves. In the same way as personal growth needs to be nurtured and developed over an extended period if it is to be of real value to the individual and the community, so we prefer to work in long term partnerships.
