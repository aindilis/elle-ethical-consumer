  <description>Isn't it horrifying to imagine being killed for your skin? Sadly, this is a reality for many animals, including kangaroos. Yup, that's right, kangaroos.

How could someone do something so awful? It's simple, really. For money. After they are slaughtered, kangaroos are skinned to be made into throw rugs, purses, jackets, or shoes. Senate Bill 880 would legalize kangaroo skin sales in California, where they have been banned since 1970. We need your help to stop it.
