  <description>On high school campuses across the country, there are students concerned with what is happening around them -- students who are interested in politics and government, foreign affairs, the law, and education. The Junior State of America (JSA) was created by and for these students. Since its inception in 1934, more than 500,000 student members have become active, informed citizens through the Junior State. 

What makes JSA so unique is that students organize every aspect of the organization, all the way from the chapter level to state and national administration. Our student leaders, elected by their fellow JSA members, plan and execute all of the conventions, conferences, and political awareness events held by the Junior State.

JSA allows for an exchange of ideas through stimulating student debates, thought talks, problem solving, and a variety of simulations. By participating in these activities, each member gains a more intelligent and informed viewpoint. JSA also provides a wonderful chance to meet and make friends with scores of other bright, involved students who have similar interests. It's an experience that you don't want to miss.
