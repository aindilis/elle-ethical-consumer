  <description>STRAY dogs are being skewered on hooks and dragged behind boats as live shark bait. The cruel practice takes place on French-controlled Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. A six-month-old labrador pup was recently found ALIVE with a huge double hook through its snout, and another through a leg. The pup was found in a coastal creek and is thought to have somehow freed itself from a fishing line, but other dogs and kittens have been chomped up and swallowed by sharks.
