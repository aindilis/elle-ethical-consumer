  <description>We are a group of individuals that have chosen John McCain as our vote for the 44th President of the United States of America. 

We have chosen to support his efforts in this campaign not only through position but through action. Our actions may be as simple as passing the word about our chosen candidate, but also through the example we set amongst our peers. 

We call out to all of our Republican friends, family members, and coworkers to unite behind the best candidate in the 2008 Presidential race.
