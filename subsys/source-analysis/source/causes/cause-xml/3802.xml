  <description>The residents of Kayafungo, one of the most arid and poor regions in Kenya, suffer from the lack of clean water. The women and children in Kayafungo walk up to six miles daily to collect water from pits that fill with rain. Schools close early to give the students time to collect water before going home in the evening.  The water from the pits is brown and filled with visible living organisms.  Most families are too poor to clean the water by boiling or with a chemical cleaning agent. Consequently many suffer from stomach problems and waterborne diseases. Currently, the Kenyan government has no waterdevelopment plans for the Kayafungo region.

In coordination with the Kayafungo community, Kenyan government officials, water engineers, and the School for International Training, the Student Movement for Real Change has developed a plan that will bring fresh piped water to over 20,000 people.

1. Reduce the walking distance to water points.

2. Provide water directly to schools.

3. Reduce waterborne diseases and stomach ailments.

4. Empower women who are currently charged to walk many miles daily for water.

5. Implement sustainable energy sources to power water pumps.

6. Provide jobs for those who are not currently employed.</description>
