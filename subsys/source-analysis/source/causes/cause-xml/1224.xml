  <description>This is for all of those who miss the Golden Age of smoking. For all of those who wish they could light their cigarette with their American made (probably the only American made thing left) Zippo. Here is the cause for all true Americans. America was built on smoking! It is a fact that the King of England was/is against smoking it; he considered it a nasty habit! Well that blimey bastard can go eat his crockets in hell! The tobacco corporations and luxury taxes there from have pumped trillions of dollars into the U.S. GNP. It is a fact that supporting this cause is supporting our troops! Our troops do not get their cigarette rations any more! It is completely ironic how people who are "pro-american" and ultra-jingoistic are against smoking! Smoking is the American way! The Marlboro Cowboy Man is the ultimate American. This cause is for all of those that beleive we should smoke anywhere! Lets hear it for the American way! All those that disagree should get a swift kick in the ass to their tea drinking country! 

1. Smoking should be allowed everywhere!

2. Smoking is not obsene.

3. Tobacco is a staple!

4. Nicottine is natural in the human body. Why not more?

5. Smoking is not only cigarettes.

6. Smoking is a right not a privilege.

7. Pretty sure early man smoked!

8. Can you prove Jesus Christ was a vegetarian non-smoker?

9. I know Hitler was a vegetarian non-smoker.

10. Are you Hitler? If not join!</description>
