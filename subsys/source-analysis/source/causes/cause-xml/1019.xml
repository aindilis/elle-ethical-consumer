  <description>For over 90 years, Planned Parenthood of New York City (PPNYC) has been a beacon of hope for the thousands of women, teens, and families who rely on us for essential reproductive health care, innovative educational programs and effective advocacy. 

Our community and educational initiatives empower teens and adults to make informed and healthy decisions. At the same time, PPNYC works to protect the right of every woman to decide for herself when and whether to become a parent. 

With your ongoing support, PPNYC will continue to provide critical information, skills, and care to all individuals, regardless of age, income, or circumstance. 

1. We believe in strong and caring families and communities, where every child is loved, cared for, and warmly welcomed.

2. Reproductive freedom is the foundation for true equality for women and men.

3. Every individual deserves equal access to the entire range of quality, science-based sexual and reproductive health care services, including safe, legal abortion.</description>
