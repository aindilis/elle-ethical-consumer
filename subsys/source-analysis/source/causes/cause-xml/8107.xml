  <description>Holyoke only has one mountain, and every day truck loads of it are getting driven away constantly . The trucks driving up and down all day alone has to take a toll on the enviroment . The size of the site is already horrible, its like a huge block was just sliced out . Take a hike up there and see for yourself, the site is to the bottom right hand side of the ski trails . Watch out for the trucks there not always to friendly tho . 

1. Only one mountain in holyoke

2. Does any one care about the enviroment these days?</description>
