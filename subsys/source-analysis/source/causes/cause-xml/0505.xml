  <description>The Heifer Project attempts to bring an end to world hunger by helping people obtain a sustainable source of food and income.  The Heifer Project provides "no interest living loans"in the form of livestock, as well as small monetary loans to help people start and expand businesses that yield big benefits for families.  Heifer's simple yet powerful approach is to lift families all over the world out of hunger and poverty.
