  <description>Using both classic and contemporary tools of persuasion, Toward Tradition promotes these positive traditional values while opposing the negative forces of &#8220;secular fundamentalism&#8221; and anti-religion bigotry. 

Concerned Jews share this objective with many evangelical and conservative Christians. Working together, they focus on our common cultural, moral, and political goals. The corollary benefit of this alliance is that the majority gentile culture sees that American Jews are not monolithically liberal, and that many of the &#8220;progressive&#8221; forces in this country are advocating positions that are in fact abhorrent to traditional Judaism.
