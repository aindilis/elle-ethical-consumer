  <description>Please help me support that gay humans are the same as the rest.  Help me support that being gay is not something that teenagers should not have to hide from their parents, that if you want to join the military you do not have to hide your sexual preference, if you want to marry someone of the same sex you should be able to....Just looking for support...What do you think???

1. Gays have the same rights as anyone else

2. There needs to be a country wide law that says that gays can get married 

3. It is hard to hide a preference or an attraction and we should not have to hide </description>
  <mission>Stop this from happening, to gays as we are humans, and there is nothing wrong with us, just a different preference in relationships</mission>
