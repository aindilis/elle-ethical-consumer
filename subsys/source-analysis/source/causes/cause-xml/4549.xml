  <description>This page discusses the most notable traits of pit bull type dogs, including the potential for dog-aggression as well as their great love for people. You will learn that while pit bulls make wonderful family companions in the right hands and living situation, they require intelligent, responsible and dedicated ownership. Unfortunately, too many people obtain these dogs for the wrong reason and/or have little understanding of the inherent traits this breed possesses. It is unfortunate that one of the original purposes of the APBT was (and still is) dog-to-dog combat, but it's a fact that can't be denied or ignored. It's important that every potential pit bull owner understand the selective breeding process that took place to make the dogs of today.
