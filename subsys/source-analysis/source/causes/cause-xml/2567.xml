  <description>Coral reefs are structures produced by living organisms, found in shallow, tropical marine waters with little to no nutrients in the water. Human activity continues to present the single greatest threat to coral reefs living in Earth's oceans. In particular, pollution and over-fishing are the most serious threats to these ecosystems.
