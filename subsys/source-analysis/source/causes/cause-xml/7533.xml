  <description>Game 4: Western conference semis....
Steve Nash is hurdled into the scorer's table by none other than Robert Horry...starting a tussle.

The next day, Amare Stoudemire and Boris Diaw, key pieces in the suns line up, get suspended...
The spurs go on to win that pivotal game 5, and the NBA championship. 

Cmon David Stern, give me a break
We all think it's unfair

Plus the spurs play cheap..
