  <description>It's common knowledge that hip hop is in a bad state, at least its mainstream counterpart.

Audiences don't seem to fret about the poor quality music being offered to them by records labels. Hip hop's image is being tarnished due to the immense melting pot of talentless rappers that inhabit the culture.

But people still buy it. There was a time when if you were a rapper, you had to be good -- if not, get lost. Things have changed... drastically. 

1. Promote and embrace true hip hop;

2. Ensure the masses realize most mainstream hip hop is... well, garbage;

3. Show people that hip hop is the greatest, most diverse musical genre... if you know where to look.</description>
