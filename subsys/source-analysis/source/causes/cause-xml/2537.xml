  <description>WATCH is a nonprofit serving low- and moderate-income people in Waltham, Massachusetts and the surrounding towns (Belmont, Lexington, Lincoln and Weston).

We help tenants avoid becoming homeless, build affordable housing, and provide English language training for immigrants. We try to break down the barriers that hold people back from prosperity and personal success.

We would like each person joining our cause to do two things:

1. Donate at least $10 to help WATCH.
2. Ask all your Facebook friends to join the cause.

Let's make this happen together!

1. Everyone should be able to afford a safe, decent place to live.</description>
