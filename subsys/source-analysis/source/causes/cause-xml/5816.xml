  <description>An Organic Faith is a faith held among people who are inherently tied to their blood and to the Earth; people who have a strong sense of Clan: Blood-Fellowship among their Family and Nation. Organic Religions rise from this sense of Clan, this sense of the Warrior Spirit alive in the ancient peoples of Scandinavia and Peloponesia (Sparta, Corinth, Olympia, etc.). The sense of honour and closeness to the soil and hard-work shapes who we are as human beings, and it is therefore necessary to depart from world religions and shun foreign influence upon European peoples (specifically Northern Europeans- Celts and Norsemen) and return to our ancestral ties to soil and blood, honour and ethic, folk and family.

1. That Europeans and people of European descent should return to their pre-Christian roots.

2. That the modern universalist worldview be abandoned in favour of a worldview founded in organic faith, ethnic nationhood, &amp; blood-kin.

3. That neo-paganism reform to true heathenry, and embrace true organic faith.</description>
