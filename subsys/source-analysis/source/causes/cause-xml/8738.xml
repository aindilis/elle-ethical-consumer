  <description>The earth normally warms up and cools down. If you have studied the Earth's history you would know that there have been big ice ages and small ice ages throughout history. How much the earth warms up before it cools down will tell how much of an ice age we will have.  From around 1290 to 1898 there was a small ice age. Also there were above average highs in 1933. In 1934 there were more hurricanes than normal.
