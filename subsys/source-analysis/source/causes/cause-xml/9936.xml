  <description>To date, Living Water International has completed more than 4,200 water projects providing clean, safe water to more than 6 million people daily in 24 countries.

LWI provides potable water through a three-pronged approach of consulting, training and equipping. We provide local and international training in well drilling, pump repair, hygiene education and construction of bio-sand filters. Following site feasibility studies, LWI provides equipment and trains nationals in operating countries so that they can construct their own water wells. We create new jobs by employing nationals and purchase materials in-country whenever possible; stimulating the local economy. Our professional and volunteer staff of engineers, geologists, construction managers, educators and health professionals serve as consultants to other ministries and relief organizations.
