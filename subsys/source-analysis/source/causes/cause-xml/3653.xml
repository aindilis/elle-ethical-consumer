  <description>Student Debt Alert is a national campaign led by and for students. Our two main goals: to educate the public about the growing necessity of student loans to pay for college; and to directly address young people's concerns about the burdens of student debt.

Student Debt Alert supports a platform that calls for reforming student loan programs, increasing student aid funding, providing better loan terms, expanding loan forgiveness programs, and improving loan refinancing options. 

1. We need to reform student loan programs.

2. We need to increase student aid funding.</description>
