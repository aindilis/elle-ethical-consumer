  <description>This walk will help raise money and awareness for all individuals who are battling blood cancers. These people are the real heroes and we need your support to help accelerate cures and hope for patients and their families. Although research is responsible for increasing survival rates for these diseases, the battle is far from over. Did you know that:

    * Every 38 minutes, someone in this country is diagnosed with blood cancer. Every 79 minutes, someone dies.
    * Leukemia is the leading cause of disease-related death among young people under age 20.
    * Lymphomas are the most common blood cancers
    * The myeloma survival rate is only 31 percent.

Please make a donation to support my participation in the Light The Night Walk. By doing so, we&#8217;ll both be helping save lives. I hope you'll visit my web site often. Be sure to check back frequently to see my progress. Thanks for your support!

Let's all be RELENTLESS in our pursuit for a CURE!
