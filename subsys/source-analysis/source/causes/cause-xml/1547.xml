  My friend Diana and I are going to Ghana, Africa this July with our school Central Connecticut State University.  Although Ghana is rich in natural resources, students in both the city and villages lack the necessary supplies for adequate learning.  The lack of writing utensils and paper make learning extremely difficult.  As a result, we have been collecting pens, pencils, notepads, notebooks, and books in order to improve the education in Ghana.  All of the supplies will be directly distributed by us when we visit these schools.  

***If you would like to contribute to our cause, please leave me a message on facebook or e-mail me at ROCKYGIRL131@YAHOO.COM.  

  MONETARY DONATIONS are also welcome!!!  The shipping of all of the supplies will be VERY EXPENSIVE so we would greatly appreciate all of your help.  

1. Ghanaian students suffer without the simple yet necessary supplies to learn and educate themselves.  

2. Improving education is imperative. 

3. It is our mission to spread awareness about the underprivileged children in Ghana.</description>
