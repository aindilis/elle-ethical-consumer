  <description>This 'Cause' is working to be a catalyst for the children of Africa still home and those that lost their way.  Through communal living, community based action and education we can acheive more than the greatest that Africa once had.

1. Africa is HOME, therefore should be treated with such respect.

2. All Black people are Africans.

3. Through Communal Ideology all the problems of Africans can be solved.</description>
