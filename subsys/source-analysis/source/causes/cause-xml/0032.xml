  <description>A huge ball of fire from an exploding gasoline tanker truck caused an overpass in the MacArthur Maze in the East Bay near the Bay Bridge to collapse on top of the highway below early Sunday, virtually ensuring major traffic problems and confusion for weeks to come.

The intense heat crumbled the elevated roadway that carried eastbound traffic from the Bay Bridge onto Interstates 580 and 980 and state Highway 24. The broken concrete fell like a blanket over the connector roadway from southbound Interstate 80 to I-880.

The tanker, full of 8,600 gallons of vehicle-ready gasoline, reportedly crashed into a pillar shortly before 4 a.m. on a tight turn and exploded in flames that continued for several hours.
