  <description>Head and neck cancers are present in our community.  They are usually defined as malignant tumors, often carcinomas, growing in the larynx, pharynx, lip, mouth, tongue, salivary glands, nose, sinuses, and lymph nodes of the neck.

Head and neck cancers do not get as much media attention as breast cancer, skin cancer, cervical cancer, or many other cancers.  This does not make them any less important.  

Risk factors for head and neck cancers include the consumption of alcohol, cigarette smoking, and chewing tobacco.  It is now accepted that cigarette smoking increases a person's risk for head and neck cancer at least 5 and up to 25-fold.

Head and neck cancers are neither more nor less important than other kinds of cancer, even though they get less attention.  Spread the word.

1. An effective cure for cancer must be found.

2. Those affected by head and neck cancer and those with loved ones affected deserve support and assistance.</description>
