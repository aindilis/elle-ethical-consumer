  <description>My Wonderful Dog is a 501c3 nonprofit located in Portland Maine.  By providing highly trained assistance dogs, they change the lives of people with disabilities.  Assistance dogs can turn light switches on and off, open doors, retrieve items and provide stability if needed.  Most importantly, they provide love and companionship to their disabled partners.

Unfortunately there is a waiting list for these magnificent animals.  By donating today you will help someone start their journey to independence that much sooner.
