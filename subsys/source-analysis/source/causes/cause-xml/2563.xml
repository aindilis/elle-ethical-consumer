  <description>In Darfur, hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children have suffered and died as a result of the three years of conflict that have ensued within the region. In addtion, millions of families have been forced from their homes and into refuge; with no other choice of survival but to rely on international aid. The conflict is ceneterd around the struggle for control between a Sudanese government supported militia group known as the "Janjaweed" and two prominent rebel groups in Darfur. Although a Peace Agreement along with a UN Resolution have been implemented, people are still dying.

1. The Genocide in Darfur must end immediately.

2. Safety is a universal right, and thus should be faciliated by UN peacekeeping forces.

3. The Genocide in Darfur must be internationally recognized as a top priority,  and all efforts must be taken to end the conflict.</description>
