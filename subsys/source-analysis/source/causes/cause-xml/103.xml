  <description>Contemporary art has progressed into various art movements throughout the 20th century, begining with Marcel Duchamp's "Fountain", and progressing with artists, musicians, and writiers like Jackson Pollock, Helen Frankenthauler, Barnett Newman, Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, Alvin Lucier, Vito Acconci, Jeff Koons, and Jenny Holzer (to name a few). As we progress further into the 21st century, it is our goal as artist, critics, and viewers to support the ever-evolving forms of contemporary art. The continual work of a contemporary artist will further spur new ideas on social issues and advance new messages for social change. Support the Contemporary Arts!
