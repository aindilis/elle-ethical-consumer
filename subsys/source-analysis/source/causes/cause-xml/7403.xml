  <description>Warton is the best school to get an MBA. I am offering all donors a % of my personal equity after 10 years of graduation. The expected ROI should be around 500 percent.

At the friend's level ($1-$10)you will get $4$+%equity.

At the benevolent level ($11-$99)you will get $4$+%equity+ a mention in my 1st book.

At the hostile takeover level ($100+) you will get $4$+%equity+ a mention in my 1st book + 5 free hours of consulting.

All of this is contingent on raising at least $75,000. Otherwise I'm going to the University of Toronto.

1. David is the future of Marketing

2. David NEEDS to go to Warton

3. David can't afford $150,000 two-year tuition.</description>
