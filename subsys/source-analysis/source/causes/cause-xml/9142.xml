  <description>Are you a girl tired of short shorts/skirts and high, tight shirts. Are you a guys that's tired of seeing girls (sorry to be blunt) breats and butts? Then this is for you! Girls need to wear proper clothing and realize that if they have to dress like that for people to "like" them, those people don't truly like them at all, and they deserve better. You have a right to be comfortable.

1. Modern shorts/skirts are way too short.

2. What's with the lowcut, tight shirts? I can't breathe!

3. You can wear normal, comfortable clothes and still look fine.</description>
