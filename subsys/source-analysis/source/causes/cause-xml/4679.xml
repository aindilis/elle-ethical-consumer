  <description>Children's Cancer Connection, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, has provided support services and programs for children and families affected by childhood cancer since 1988. The organization sponsors two week-long summer camps for children with cancer and their siblings. Approximately 300 children attend the annual camp programs designed to help these children briefly escape cancer&#8217;s effects on both them and their family. 

Children's Cancer Connection also includes: Camp Heart Connection, weekend retreats, hospital based programs, family outings, support groups, a lending library, and The Survivorship Connection.

Children's Cancer Connection provides these services for all children diagnosed and/or treated in Iowa. This includes children from every corner of the state, as well as children from western Illinois and southeastern South Dakota.

Children's Cancer Connection provides the only summer camps in Iowa devoted exclusively to children with cancer, and the sibling program was one of the first of its kind in the nation. Camp Heart Connection is provided at no cost to the families because of generous support from both individuals and organizations. Outings and weekend retreats are provided at little or no cost to participants and no one is ever turned away from an activity because of an inability to pay.
