  <description>Sign the KYOTOplus petition - it takes five seconds! http://is.gd/ZptK

Global warming is the greatest threat to life on earth. Entire populations and ecosystems are threatened by devastating impacts such as drought, heat waves, fires, floods, storms and rising sea levels.

Scientists have warned the United Nations that only urgent action can avert uncontrollable, runaway climate change.

Green solutions will create thousands of jobs and build a strong economy. 

To preserve our environment and ensure a livable world for our children, I call on Canadian politicians to support these KYOTOplus goals: 

Set a national target to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 25 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020.
Implement an effective national plan to reach this target and help developing countries to reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change.
Adopt a bold, strengthened second phase of the Kyoto Protocol at the pivotal United Nations Climate Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, December 2009.

The Government of Canada must act NOW to make climate change our highest priority.

Sign now!
