  <description>This cause is for anyone who believes thr Emo/Punk era has gone to far and needs to end. The Emo/punk era has brought us bands such as Good Charlotte, Fall out Boy, Panic at the gay (disco), Dashboard Confessionals, and many other trendy pop/punk/emotional bullshit. The main priority of this group is to help people recognize true value in music. Sure a simple power chord sturmmed over sappy love lyrics can be nice, but it's nose plugged vocals are not. Modern Punk and Emo is typically not from the heart and it is from the wallet, so boycott shit like Fall out at the Disco.



1. Emo/Punk music is cheapening the value of what music really is.

2. Emo/Punk vocals are the absolute worst.

3. Emo/Punk lyrics about break ups are annoying and should be stopped.</description>
