While Senator Brownback is no longer 
running for President, he is working for candidates this fall who fight for protection of all life especially those in the womb, the fight to save traditional marriage, and uphold the right of the second amendment.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Please help Senator Brownback elect great like-minded pro-life Republican candidates this November 2008, including John McCain!

Your support will help to seat that last judge on the US Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade, and eventually abolish abortion all together.

Stand with Sam in 2008, and lets support the dignity of human life as we head to the polls!
