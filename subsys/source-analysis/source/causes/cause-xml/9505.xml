  <description>Indego Africa is a U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit that sells handicrafts designed and made by artisans who work with its partner organizations in Africa.  Indego Africa partners will be existing community groups in African nations dedicated to teaching employable skills to their communities.  Indego Africa handicrafts will be sold in their country of origin, in retail stores in the US and Europe, and on its website (eventually).  Indego Africa is searching for retailers interested in handicraft products with aesthetic appeal, unique design features, cultural significance and a compelling narrative.  Through innovative marketing and a commitment to transparency and business ethics, Indego Africa consumers can be confident that products they buy and donations they make will directly support worthy development projects.

1. Africans can develop themselves when given the tools and opportunities.

2. African traditional culture and art should be celebrated and discovered.

3. Non-profits should be completely transparent to the public and ethical at all times.</description>
