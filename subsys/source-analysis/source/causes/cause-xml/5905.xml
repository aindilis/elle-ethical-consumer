  <description>Our main focus over the last few years has been to reduce the effects of global warming world wide.  After copious research studies and thousands of reports the scientific data shows the number one greenhouse gas in the environment to be 'Di-hydrogenmonoxide'. 

 Our goals as a active green organization have shifted to the removal and general ban of this substance world wide. Not only does this chemical increase our planets surface temperature, it's also now found in food all tested sources around the world. The dangers of this chemical seem to be underminded by officials however there are numerous accounts of people in all age ranges who have come into contact with high concentrations of Di-hydrogenmonoxide resulting in sever shortness of breath and even death. 

Please help us remove this nasty chemical from our everyday lives and help make our planet better today for a better tomorrow!
