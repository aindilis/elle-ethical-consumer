  <description>Jugball was created while attempting to fool a park ranger into thinking we were playing a different game then we were actually going to play. After inventing, the creators realized the "awesomeness" of the game and decided to continue playing. It was during this time a drunk mid-thirtys male came up and stated, "This game is cool as shit! It is going to be in the Olympics someday". This middle aged man inspired me to try to make that dream come true. 

1. Anything we can to make it in the olympics....do it

2. Feel free to altar the rules in your favor when teaching someone new

3. Have fun a hit someone in the face</description>
