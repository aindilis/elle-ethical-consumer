  <description>The Maldives is currently a theocracy where the basic human freedoms spelt out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are curtailed. Current proposals for political reform fall well short of granting internationally guaranteed human rights that Maldivians demand and have when they travel to countries of the civilised world. There are no political parties or civil society organisations in the Maldives that advocate full human rights. All opposition parties and the government are fully committed in writing to deny citizens at least one of the basic human rights guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Those who are committed to this cause wish to change this situation.

1. All theocratic laws must be abolished

2. Freedom of belief must be guaranteed without prejudice to all citizens, residents and visitors

3. Public funding of theocratic institutions must end immediately</description>
