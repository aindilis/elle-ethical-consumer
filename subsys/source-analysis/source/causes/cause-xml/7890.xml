  <description>Achievement First is a non-profit charter school management organization started in July 2003 by the leaders of Amistad Academy, a high-performing charter school in New Haven, CT.  We aim to bring to scale a system of high-performing, college preparatory charter schools in New York and Connecticut.

The mission of Achievement First is to deliver on the promise of equal educational opportunity for all of America&#8217;s children. We believe that all children, regardless of race or economic status, can succeed if they have access to a great education.

Achievement First schools will provide all of our students with the academic and character skills they need to graduate from top colleges, to succeed in a competitive world, and to serve as the next generation of leaders of their communities.
