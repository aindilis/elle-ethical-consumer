  <description>When all else failed: 

Tony Iommi laid a sonic bridge through our estranged neural circuitry to the dark castle in our hearts;
Ronnnie James Dio lived in there even although sometimes we didn't notice (not just because he is so short but because sometimes King Diamond took his place); 
Dave Lombardo's double bass work scared both those dudes out of there;
Then our hearts were empty again and we continued searching until we found... Tool.  We began to rebuild.
