  <description>This is meant to explain that Agnosticism is not the same as Atheism. It is not the belief that no God exists. 

The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as:
 One who holds that the existence of anything beyond and behind material phenomena is unknown and (so far as can be judged) unknowable, and especially that a First Cause and an unseen world are subjects of which we know nothing.
  [Suggested by Prof. Huxley at a party held previous to the formation of the now defunct Metaphysical Society, at Mr. James Knowles's house on Clapham Common, one evening in 1869, in my hearing. He took it from St. Paul's mention of the altar to &#8216;the Unknown God.&#8217; R. H. HUTTON in letter 13 Mar. 1881.] 

In laymen's terms, this means that is impossible for anyone to determine the true existence of a god, whether it be Chrisitian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Buddist, or any other major religion. One can not prove the existence of god without being dead first (and then it would be hard to tell everyone). 

This is not a money making idea...This is just a cause for information...to inform the world the agnostics still believe that there is something else there but it is not known to any of us.

1. To inform the uninformed about agnosticsm

2. To explain that agnosticism is different than athiesm</description>
