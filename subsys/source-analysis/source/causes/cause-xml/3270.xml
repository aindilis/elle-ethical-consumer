  <description>Hey Greenie - stop using your computer to spread the message and go and live in a cave. KWG is sick of all the people out there going on and on about Global Warming.

If people actually cared, they would have stoped doing the activities that they claim cause global warming, like using their computers, driving cars, or having the air conditioning on.



1. Global Warming is hype.

2. If people actually cared, they would cease all their carbon producing activity now.

3. Spread the word about 'Nine Facts about Global Warming' (More copies are being printed).</description>
