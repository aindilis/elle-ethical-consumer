  <description>During This Recent Summer (2007) i joined several other teens on a trip to Worcester, Massachusetts with and organization called Young Neighbors In Action (YNIA). This organization consists of different work sites around the world, primarily in the United States but also in Mexico. The Trip Consists of a 1 week trip for normal sign ups, some trips can last the whole summer depending on the Site and Damage.

I was lucky enough to work with a Man named Thomas Lewis. Tom Lewis Gave up his whole life to live a life of solidarity. He houses the poor, helps them regain there balance in their life so they can start over. He lived in a Triple Decker Flat in the Worcester, Massachusetts. The  Inside was sort of falling apart and it needed new paint and a new fence.

The 6 days i spent at the Emma House Really Changed my outlook on peoples needs and wants. In 6 days me and my team painted 1 bedroom for a guest to sleep in, and removed and reinstalled a new fence for the Emma House. They're is alot more work to be done on the house so now i ask everyone to please donate so the Emma House can Keep on Going.
