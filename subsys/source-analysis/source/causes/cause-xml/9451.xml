  <description>While out for a run early one morning I noticed 5 cents lying on the ground.....and how often do we notice coinage lying on the ground when we are out and about and we don't even bother to to pick it up!

I think if we took the time to pick up these coins - worldwide....we could put these funds to good use

When you are out and about (running, walking, shopping,etc), please 'pick up' any discarded coins you may find and donate this money to help those individuals who really need it.
