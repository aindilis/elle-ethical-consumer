  <description>Much Love Animal Rescue is a 100% nonprofit, no-kill organization dedicated to reducing overpopulation, abuse and neglect of domestic animals. When we find animals wandering the streets, we take them to local shelters to give their owners a chance to claim them. If no owner appears, we take the animals into our possession. We also rescue dogs and cats from the pounds who could be loving pets but are about to be put to sleep due to overcrowding, illness or disease.

1. Rescuing stray animals from animal shelters who have not been adopted and are now on death row. 

2. Securing a no-kill facility where rescued pets can be safely sheltered without the threat of euthanization until we find adoptive parents for them

3.  Providing medical care to neglected, abused and injured animals

4. Providing spay and neuter services in order to drastically reduce the number of unwanted animals on the street

5. Educating children and adults alike on responsible pet guardianship</description>
  <mission>Our primary focus is finding safe, loving homes for unwanted, neglected and/or abused animals.</mission>
