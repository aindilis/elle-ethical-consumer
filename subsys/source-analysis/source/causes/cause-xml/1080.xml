  <description>Currently the naturalistic worldview is insufficiently expressed within most cultures. The purpose of this movement is to achieve collective recognition and influence necessary to garner social acceptance and civic equity for the great diversity of persons who have a naturalistic worldview. Under a broad umbrella and through educational programs, the constituents (Brights) promote public understanding of the naturalistic worldview and seek acceptance and full rights of citizenship participation for all such individuals within in a society otherwise permeated with supernaturalism.

The The Brights' Web site serves brights in over 137 nations, hosts a forum, has a "Books for Brights" program, a monthly Bulletin, and various "action arenas" working toward creating a level playing field for all worldviews.

One current example of a Bright's Central initiative is the Reality About Morality project.   Details can be found at http://www.the-brights.net/action/activities/organized/arenas/1/project.html


1. A bright is a person who has a naturalistic worldview

2. A bright's worldview is free of supernatural and mystical elements 

3. The ethics and actions of a bright are based on a naturalistic worldview.</description>
