  <description>The world needs to know that Friends United in Kindness and Caring (FUKC) is looking out for them. Light a candle for someone around the world, and just THINK about them. Let's all get together and FUKC the world!

This group is made quite tongue-in-cheek, but it does benefit a serious cause: money donated will go to Habitat for Humanity, a great fukcing group.

1. It's important to show kindness and caring

2. the world needs to come together in its time of need

3. it's really fukcing funny when an acronym sounds like a swear word.</description>
