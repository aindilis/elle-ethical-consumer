  <description>The world is here for us to explore, right?  The more we know about it, the more we can do with it.  This cause is dedicated to the idea that everyone should have free access to accurate, up-to-date, easily navigable information about the world we live in, and its people.  Information is not meant to separate the haves frome the have-nots--it's meant to share.  Whether it be to simply satisfy your curiosity, or to do something that will change the world, you have a right to know!
The flip side of this is that we all have an efficient means of disseminating information to everyone, provided it is accurate.

1. We all have a right to know

2. We all have a right to let others know</description>
  <mission>ensure that everyone has access to free, accurate information about the world around them.</mission>
