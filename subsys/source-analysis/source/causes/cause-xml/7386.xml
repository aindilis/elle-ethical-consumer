  <description>The sweeping policy at Concord High School is total crap.  If they want us to come to school every day at least make it seem like it's not a prison

1. Locking students out of class is retarded.

2. Giving us detention for being 2 min late is ridiculous.

3. The administrators don't care what we think.</description>
