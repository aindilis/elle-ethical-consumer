  <description>An animal cannot speak, and cannot tell us if this is what they want. Obviously, animals don't want chemicals dropped in their eyes, or have to smoke.. They don't have a way to speak up the way we do. They are crammed into tiny cages, with barely any food and water, and are depreived of affection! The more people that stand up against it the better. 

1. To STOP testing on animals

2. If they want that new product, test it on yourself

3. Animals bodies DON'T function the same way as humans

4. We really don't need another hairspray, shampoo or hairdye</description>
