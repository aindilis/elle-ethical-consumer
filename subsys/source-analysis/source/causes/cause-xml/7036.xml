  <description>Jesus never meant for our religions or our churches to be split up.  He meant for all of us to be one people who were of the same mindset and passion (Him) and who "saturated" their area with His name.  Who cares about denomination, as long as we worhip the One and only true God?



1. We are not here to judge anyone of any religious standing, nationality, or creed.

2. We are here for the purpose of praising and glorifying our creator.

3. We choose to love all people, no matter what, because we also choose to be Christ-like and Christ-loving.

4. We are one.</description>
