  <description>29,000 Children die every day because they are not fed and get proper care.  Our goal is to raise 10,000 dollars  to send to World Vision to save children! Only a dollar a day can save a child.  That is giving up one bottle of soda a day! ONLY ONE!

The youth and college kids at the Bridge Church in Fortville, IN will be going without for food 30 Hours on June 29th thru June 30th!  We would love for everyone's support!  If you can not donate, please be praying for us, it will be difficult, but we will do it!  

We've had many negative comments saying that we could not raise 10,000 dollars, but I pray and hope that we can prove everyone wrong. We have already raised about 1500 dollars! Please HELP US!

On Sunday, July 8th, we will be running the entire service that day and would love to see you all out there!  The whole service will be based on our 30 HR famine, so if you would like more info, please come find out or get ahold of me!

Thanks for the support everyone!

1. That teens can make a difference in the world.

2. If everyone were to donate even a dollar a day, then millions of children would be saved!</description>
