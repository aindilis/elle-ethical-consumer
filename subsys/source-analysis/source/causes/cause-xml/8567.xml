  <description>Bright Night Providence was founded in 2003 after Providence's long-running New Year's Eve festival, First Night, was cancelled. Organized in less than three months, the event drew over 12,000 people to downtown Providence, making Bright Night the largest New Year's Eve party in the state. The festival features local artists and performers at venues throughout downtown Providence, and provides a fun, vibrant, and family friendly atmosphere for the people of Rhode Island.

Now in its fifth year, Bright Night has become a successful festival.  Last year's festival featured two fireworks displays, expanded afternoon activities, and over 20,000 spectators.  

The festival's director, Adam Gertsacov, is an actor, director, and clown. He wears many hats, including that of a flea circus impresario, a local author, the esteemed hat of the Clown Laureate of Greenbelt, Maryland, and many others. He became the Festival director of Bright Night Providence in 2003 when a group of local artists (himself included) didn't want to see the city go dark on New Year's Eve.
