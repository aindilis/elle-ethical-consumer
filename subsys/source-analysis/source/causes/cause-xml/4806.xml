  <description>Intersection for the Arts is San Francisco's oldest alternative art space and presents challenging new works in literature, theater, visual and interdisciplinary arts. We provide the community with a place where provocative ideas, diverse art forms, artists and audiences can intersect one another. We offer a space to perform and exhibit, programs of technical and financial assistance, and a point of view that encourages vision, risk-taking and discovery. Intersection is an art space where experimentation and risk are still possible, where debate and critical inquiry are embraced, and where community is essential.

Intersection annually produces 6 theater runs, 12 literary readings, 10 jazz shows, 3 visual arts exhibitions, 10 hybrid multidisciplinary events, in addition to attendant events in each discipline including workshops, conversations, panel discussions, and video screenings. We exist to serve and nurture the Bay Area artistic community.
