  <description>Founded in 2002, ArtWorks provides children and young adults suffering from chronic and life-threatening illnesses, and their siblings, access to creative and performing arts programs that encourage the use of the creative process as a vehicle for healing, communication, self-expression and personal development. 
ArtWorks seeks to empower, validate, and honor these children by offering them the hands-on experience and materials with which to create, as well as the opportunity to publicly share their artistic accomplishments.
Hospitals and healthcare agencies in the New York Metropolitan area have come to depend on ArtWorks to provide their patients with the tools and motivation to awaken the creative spirit that enhances their lives and their time spent in and out of the hospital. ArtWorks ultimately provides children with the opportunity to channel their feelings and energy through a host of creative outlets, inspiring confident and creative young people.

1. Creative arts programming serves to reduce stress &amp; anxiety, decrease attention to pain &amp; normalize the hospital experience for these children.</description>
