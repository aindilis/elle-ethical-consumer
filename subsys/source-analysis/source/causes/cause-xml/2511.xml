  <description>We are a group of bully loving owners, rescuers, fans, trainers, fosters, food providers and kiss sponges who are working hard to give Pit Bulls the fair chance they deserve. We specialize in American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, and American Bull Dogs, collectively known to most as Pit Bulls!

We are the voice unheard for these breeds, and yet we are the majority of pit bull owners in today's society. If you're surprised by this, perhaps reading our site will enlighten you to who actually does own these dogs, and what these dogs are truly about. We champion for these "under dogs" because our love for them is as strong as their devotion to us.
