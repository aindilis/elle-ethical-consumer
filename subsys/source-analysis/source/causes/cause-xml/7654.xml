  <description>Zimbabwe, once a thriving nation, now faces a political and humanitarian crisis. Its people have lost their confidence in the leadership while investors and educated folk have left the country to fend for itself.

Hyperinflation (over 10,000,000%), political instability and around 85% unemployment causing many people to live on less than US$7 a month. Needless to say, the people face starvation and need active intervention from the outside to sustain basic needs.

The health care system is collapsing. In some hospitals - were there are no working lights in operating rooms - doctors are using the lights of their cellphones to perform cesarean sections. Around 3000 people die every week in Zimbabwe due to the Aids pandemic, Zimbabwe shockingly has the highest number of orphans in the world in relation to its population.

We aim to create international awareness, and call on the world to intervene.

1. 1 out of every 5 children living in Zimbabwe is an orphan

2. Every 15 minutes a child in Zimbabwe dies from HIV

3. 1 US$ is equal to 54.036.639.077,74+ ZWD

4. More than 66,000 people have recently been infected with cholera, 3300+ have already died</description>
