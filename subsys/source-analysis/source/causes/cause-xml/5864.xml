  <description>Do you love ferrets? Do you have ferrets? Because if you do then I am sure you are aware that ferrets are only legal in certain states. Also that certain apartment complexes will not allow you to have a ferret as a pet. Even how hard it is to find a vet that will take ferrets. So the mission is to make people more aware of how friendly and cute ferrets really are. All the proceeds will go to a ferret organization to help ferrets. So if you love ferrets or you wanna know more about ferrets then feel free to join. Because this cause is important too. Everyday people have there ferrets taken from them because they are illegal in certain states to have. So lets fight back to keep our little ones rights to be here. Once you join if you have ferrets then post up some pics of them and tell us all about them. I will also be on here from time to time answering questions about ferrets too. 

1. Ferrets should be legal in every state if things like guinea pigs and hamsters are!

2. They really do not stink if you have there stink gland remove!

3. They make perfect friends and bring tons of laughter to a household!

4. Each one has a quirky personality!

5. They need a ton of work and caring for but are totally worth it. 

6. Having a big dig box for your ferrets to play in will bring you tons of laughter!!!</description>
