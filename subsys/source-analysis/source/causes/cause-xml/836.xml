  <description>Christian recording artist Mark Shultz has accepted a huge undertaking. He is riding his bicycle across America! He is giving concerts along the way, and the proceeds go to help fulfill the calling for God's people to look after widows and orphans. 

"Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world." - James 1:27
