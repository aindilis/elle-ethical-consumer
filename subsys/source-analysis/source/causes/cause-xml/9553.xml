  <description>Jonathan Tang has had erection problems for years, recently this has been found with accompanying symptoms of an inability to pee in a cup and the desire to deny that this ever occurred. We are here to help Tang by raising awareness of his problem and thus enabling many people to congratulate him on his handling of the problem, and allowing for him to continue his usage through funding of his addiction.
