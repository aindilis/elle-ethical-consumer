  <description>The StopBigMedia.com Coalition is made up of groups from across the spectrum that agree to a set of principles and have banded together to stop the FCC from allowing a handful of giant corporations to dominate America's media system.

We believe that a free and vibrant media, full of diverse and competing voices, is the lifeblood of America's democracy. We're working together to see that our media system remains, in the words of the Supreme Court, "an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will prevail."

No corporation or political party is funding our efforts.
