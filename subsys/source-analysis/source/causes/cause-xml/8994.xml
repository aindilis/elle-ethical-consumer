  <description>You may be wondering what Take Action means. Like most things in life, names have different meanings to different people. To some, Take Action means a tour of cool punk and hardcore bands; to others, it means a CD compilation series filled with tons of well-known bands that comes out every year; and to others, Take Action means saving lives from suicide by finding warning signs early and realizing there are people who can help. To us at Sub City, Take Action is the idea that we will not wait for our world, our country, our government, our teachers, or even our parents to make ours and other people's lives better, creating a better world...one voice and one action at a time!
