  <description>This is Anchorman Ron Burgundy and I look good. Anyway this cause was started by me becuase I believe that we're all going to be dead sometime soon so we have got to eat these animals so they won't have the earth all to themselves. I don't know about you but this Earth is my damn house!!!

1. Dogs will have the house to themselves so we got to eat them.

2. The cats will scratch the sofas so we got to eat them.

3. The birds will poop on our cars so we got to eat them.</description>
