  <description>Our goal is to Double the $18,000 that we raised last year. The money goes to assisting people with Brain Injuries. A traumatic brain injury happens when something impacts the head with enough force to cause the brain to move around inside the skull. Brain injuries can result from motorcycle crashes, car wrecks, sports injuries, firearms or simple falls.Each brain injury results in a unique set of problems. Some brain injury patients need help learning how to retrain their brain and body to do routine tasks like eating, dressing, walking, talking and other skills. Many people after having a brain injury cannot afford medical care. We want to help raise the money to allow them to have the care they need for rehabilitation.


1. We need your Help
