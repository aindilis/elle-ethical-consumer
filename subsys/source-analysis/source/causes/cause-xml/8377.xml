  <description>August 17th marks 7 years since my close friend Aaron Shoulders was swarmed by 12 gang-members and brutally beaten and stabbed in front of NYLA nightclub.

Aaron was an innocent bystander promoting peace... he was tortured to death, suffered horrendously for 15 days and died September 1st 2003... 

the gang violence continues to escalate... 

How many more innocent bystanders must die before something is done???? Our Police chief told us "WE ARE ALL IN DANGER" 

WAKE UP CALGARY!!! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!! 

AARON SHOULDERS
WALK FOR JUSTICE 
FOR MURDER VICTIMS
INTERNATIONAL 


September 11, 20109 @ 2 PM
In Calgary, AB Canada

From 
NYLA (former) 1211 &#8211; 1 STREET SW
To 
The Calgary COURT CENTER
Back to 
NYLA NIGHTCLUB (former) 



Purpose:
An Awareness walk in honor of our Murdered Loved Ones
Families of Murder Victims NEED Remembrance, Justice, Accountability and Prevention
A platform to give a voice to families of Murder Victims
An outcry against lenient sentencing and lack of Justice
A protest against the escalating violence; especially against our youth

Please join us if you are tired of the escalating violence in our City or have been personally affected 


Come out and walk for Justice
"Those who stand for nothing, fall for everything"

Because:
Calgary's MURDER RATE has tripled since 2003
Gang Violence is on the rise!
Violent Criminals have NO deterrence!
Short and lenient sentences for Murderers means they are free to re-offend!
Nationally, more homicides are committed by KNIFE vs. guns! - Stats Canada October 2009 -
Lastly... something has to change!
