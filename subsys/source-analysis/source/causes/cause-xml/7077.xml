  <description>I am biking 202 miles from Seattle to Portland on July 14th and 15th as part of STP 2007.

I'm riding to support Asha and its goal of helping to educate underprivileged children in India.  Asha Seattle is currently supporting two projects which are in the process of working towards this goal.

&lt;b&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.ashanet.org/seattle/events/woc/profile_head.php?arvind"&gt;Read more about my ride and donate directly here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
(Please use the above link instead of the Donate button so I can keep track of your donation.)


Knowing that I have your support will definitely help motivate me to finish my ride.
Every little bit helps!  Thanks!
