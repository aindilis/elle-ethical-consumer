  <description>Inspired by my recent studies of this immensely influential and misunderstood philosopher, the Society for Nietzsche Scholarship is dedicated to examining the life and works of Nietzsche in order to foster a better understanding of this dynamo of philosophical and literary intellect. Join to discuss, promote, and dwell upon the man who is Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche.
