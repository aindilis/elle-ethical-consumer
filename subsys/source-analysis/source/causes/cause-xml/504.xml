  <description>WWOZ is a listener-supported, volunteer-operated radio station serving the New Orleans area locally and the world via the Internet. The station, founded by a group of local music lovers, broadcasts live from the annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.

WWOZ has had many homes. The original antenna hung from a telephone pole at the levee near the Huey P. Long Bridge before eventually moving upstairs at Tipitina&#8217;s. In 1984, the station moved to Armstrong Park where it broadcast from a 3-room building adjacent to Perseverance Hall. The flooding from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina forced WWOZ to relocate in 2005 to the historic French Quarter.

The station's online presence offers several ways to contribute, from local volunteering at the station to matching gifts from employers to fund-drive donations.

1. The rich cultural heritage of New Orleans must be preserved.

2. Community radio needs constant support.</description>
