  <description>The oil giant British Petroleum (BP) plans to increase dumping of ammonia and industrial sludge into Lake Michigan through its Indiana based refinery. The permit exempts the BP plant at Whiting, Ind., 3 miles southeast of Chicago, from a 1995 federal regulation limiting mercury discharges into the Great Lakes to 1.3 ounces per year. Environmental studies have shown that mercury, a neurotoxin, as well as other toxins BP will continue to dump are harmful to humans and wildlife. Under the  new state water permit BP can release 54% more ammonia and 35% more sludge into the lake every day. The five Great Lakes contain 18 percent of the  water supply for the world, and about 90 percent of the water supply in the U.S. If spread evenly across the contiguous 48 states, the lakes' water would be about 9.5 feet deep. Only the polar ice caps contain more fresh water. The Great Lakes need your support and environmental protection.

1. BP must stop dumping in Lake Michigan immediately.

2. The Great Lakes are a resource unlike any other in the world and need legislation to protect them from any and all dumping.

3. Stop supporting false marketing by BP's "Green" Campaign and stop buying their gas.</description>
