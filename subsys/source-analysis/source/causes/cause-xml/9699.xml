  <description>The Humane Society of North Texas (HSNT) is a non-profit organization serving Tarrant and surrounding counties since 1905. We are supported solely by tax deductible donations and do not receive funding from county, state or federal entities, nor are we subsidized by any other organization. 

Our mission is to act as an advocate on behalf of the animals and ensure their legal and ethical protection; to provide for the well-being of animals who are injured, neglected, mistreated or otherwise in need; to relieve suffering and prevent cruelty to animals. In accordance to our mission, we promote kindness, justice and mercy to every living creature entering our door. Our shelter is dedicated to providing a place of protection for animals in need and none are turned away.
