  <description>Chimpanzees in West Africa could be extinct within 40 years, unless we act now. Already, chimpanzees have disappeared from 13 of the 25 African countries they once inhabited.

The speed at which chimps are disappearing from the wild is much faster than previously predicted. Of the four chimpanzee subspecies, the pan troglodytes vellerosus population has dwindled to 8,000 &#8211; an amount that does not support a sustainable population when factored against the increased impact of hunting and deforestation. Scientists give this subspecies a mere 20 years until the end of its existence.

It is estimated that at this rate of development, more than 90% of primate habitats in Africa will be gone within 25 years.

The threats to chimpanzees are many, and the odds seem insurmountable, but there are many ways to make a difference, one person at a time.
