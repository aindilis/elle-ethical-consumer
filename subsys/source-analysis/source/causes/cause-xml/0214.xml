  <description>The United Nations, founded after WWII to "save succeeding generations from the scourge of war," is one of the things standing between world peace and world war. It also provides millions every day with food and humanitarian aid, as well as medical assistance, economic and political aid, and military protections.

Americans must support the United Nations if either the UN or the United States are to achieve full security and thrive in the future.
