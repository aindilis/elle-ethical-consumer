  <description>Currently ABB is working in New Orleans, LA, to help the people rebuild their homes and their lives after Hurricane Katrina. Working out of Gentilly Baptist Church, New Orleans,  as of August 11, 2007, 4094 volunteers have completed 1123 jobs. Volunteer crews have completed 217 homes in which the owners have been able to move back in to. ABB volunteers have reported 7804 evangelistic contacts which have resulted in 113 professions of faith. These numbers reflect compiled reports provided by construction leaders from January 18th, 2006 through August 11, 2007.
ABB is funded by the Arkansas Baptist State Convention. The State Convention also funds Nailbenders for Jesus and Church in a Day construction missions.
Arkansas Baptist Builders (ABB) is a construction ministry that was founded to assist our churches that are in need of help with small construction projects and strives to make a difference in communities in need.  ABB teams are made up of church and associational construction teams that take on these construction projects.
