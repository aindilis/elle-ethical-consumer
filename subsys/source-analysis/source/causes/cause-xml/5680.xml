  <description>World Community Grid's mission is to create the largest public computing grid benefiting humanity. Our work is built on the belief that technological innovation combined with visionary scientific research and large-scale volunteerism can change our world for the better. Our success depends on individuals - like you - collectively contributing their unused computer time to this not-for-profit endeavor.

You can help create new vaccines and medication for various diseases, including possible cures for AIDS and Muscular Dystrophy.

All you have to do is donate the time your computer is turned on, but is idle, to projects that benefit humanity!
