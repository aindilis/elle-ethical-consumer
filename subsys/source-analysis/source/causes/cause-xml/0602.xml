  <description>Honor Killings is a form of punishment used mainly by people deriving from an Islamic background. It is used when a female is accused of infidelity. They are punished by death or even mutilation. This problem needs attention because thousands of cases go unreported every year. These women that are raped or innocent are stoned to death or scarred and burned for life for something they are wrongly accused of. In most cases the father, brother, or husband carry out the honor killing to regain respect within the family when the only offense by the women might have been looking at another man. Bring attention to these atrocities for these women who know nothing else in their lives but what men tell them to do.
