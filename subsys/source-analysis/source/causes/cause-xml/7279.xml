  <description>I was watching Live Earth the other day and I really started thinking about our planet and what might happen in a few years if we keep treating it the way we are. So I figured that if everyone does at least one little thing to prevent global warming, (turn off your lights when your not using them), then this planet might still be okay to live in. You may think that if you do something, it wont make a diffrence. But if people see you making a change then they will change too! Every action has a reaction, we have one earth and one chance! Answer The Call! 

1. Stop Global Warming.

2. Don't Let Our Animals Get Extinct.

3. Be More Eco-Friendly.</description>
