  <description>I started this group to raise money and awareness for The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society of Canada.  


The Society was established in 1949 as The de Villiers Foundation. In 2000, the Society changed its name from The Leukemia Society of America to The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society to emphasize its commitment to fighting all blood cancers. 


Today, the Society supports the following major programs: research, patient services, public and professional education, advocacy and community services. With headquarters in White Plains, NY, the Society has chapter offices across the United States and is a single corporation doing business under New York State not-for-profit corporate laws.
