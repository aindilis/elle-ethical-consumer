  <description>If we wanted to pay for knowledge we would all be Scientologists!

How do we educate the poor with pecuniary restrictions on e-information?

Free the auto-didact by freeing the word (and number of course)!

Why should we pay a periodic subscription for one day's need?

Why must my curiosity be quelled by the hefty price of a few pages of electronically simulated data?



***I DONOT BENEFIT FROM ANY DONATIONS - THEY GO DIRECTLY TO THE NONPROFIT PATRON LISTED ABOVE***



1. Students of any age should not have to pay for e-knowledge! PERIOD.</description>
