  <description>Since 1980, Prevent Child Abuse New York has inspired parents, policy makers and community members to put the needs of kids first. Focusing on community activities and public policies that prioritize prevention right from the start, we work to make sure child abuse and neglect never occur.

Through statewide leadership and collaboration, our work ensures the healthy development of New York's children, recognizing that physical and emotional health are essential to community well-being and economic prosperity.
