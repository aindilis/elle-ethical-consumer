  <description>If you haven't seen the video yet, you're urged to watch. It will only take a few minutes of your time, and in those few minutes open up your eyes to a practice most of us never knew existed: the decimation of dolphins to be sold as 'whale' meat in Japan. Dolphins are butchered, slaughtered and killed without compassion or care; these mammals either bleed to death or suffocate, and in a way that is difficult to watch, much less sit by and allow. Please help put an end to the bloodshed.
