  <description>We stand here united and dedicated to support the fight against all cancers. We welcome cancer stories to be told, along with prayer and support.

Certain research and advancements are being made, but cancer still rings a devastating melody in all our ears. As a result, we hope to support various cancer foundations in multiple ways, let it be money donations or volunteering.

Invite all your friends and acquaintances, for the fight against cancer affects everyone. 

All donations currently go to the American Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society's mission statement states the organization is a , "nationwide community-based voluntary health organization dedicated to eliminating cancer as a major health problem by preventing cancer, saving lives, and diminishing suffering from cancer, through research, education, advocacy and service." The American Cancer society provides several grants to cancer researchers, and participates widely in campaigns that have contributed to bringing cancer patients to victory. A world without cancer is within reach. Imagine what would happen if everyone just donated one dollar.
