  <description>Seeds of Sadaqah is a non-profit charity dedicated to helping those in need in our community on a monthly basis. Through your donations of small change, we can collectively make a big change in someone's life. 

Seeds of Sadaqah is a project under the Islamic Social Welfare Association under the Windsor Islamic Association

Please visit our website for this months case at www.seedsofsadaqah.com 

PLEASE DONATE DIRECTLY FROM THE WEBSITE VIA PAYPAL. ICNA is NOT the beneficiary.  I had to choose a non-profit organization for some reason.
