  <description>Recently I have been made aware of the conditions of VA hospitals around the country. Our soliders are coming home to hospitals infested with roaches and rats. They are being neglected by their doctors and mistreated by their country that swore to help them.

1. Soliders deserve what they are promised when they volunatrily go to war.

2. People need to know that their sons and daughters are being neglected by the system.</description>
