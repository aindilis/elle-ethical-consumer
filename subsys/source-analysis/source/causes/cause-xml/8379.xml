  <description>Societies never define individuals, individuals define societies. In an age of great societal transformation, more and more frequently the rights of the individual are being sacrificed for the "benefit" of the majority. The objective, natural human rights are ceding to the subjective, majority good. The rights and freedoms for the individual are the building blocks for modern, flourishing Western societies. His ability for free speech has allowed progress, his personal property has allowed for growth, and his individual responsibility has allowed a hard-working and determined populace to thrive. However, the successes derived from the autonomous individual have been both overlooked and undervalued. These successes have been used to create new societies, where the individual is less valued than the whole. 
This group is dedicated to raising awareness of both the decreased importance of the individual, and the necessary rights that each individual should be entitled to.

1. All individuals are entitled certain inalienable human rights.

2. Upholding the rights of the individual ought to be the primary goal of governments.

3. Individuals can express themselves to the farthest lawful extent.</description>
