  <description>The Dominican Foundation, a non-profit organization, founded in 1984 was created due to the tremendous poverty that exists in the Dominican Republic as a result of corruption, overpopulation, job scarcity, the increased gap between the rich and the poor, and the rise in the national debt. The goal of the Dominican Foundation is to promote awareness among the American and Dominican populations residing in the United States as to the necessities that exists in the Dominican Republic. Additionally, the Dominican Foundation has recently sought to expand their reach bi-nationally, focusing their efforts on helping Dominicans everywhere - in both the United States and the Dominican Republic.

ince 1990, The Dominican Foundation has sought to improve the lives of Dominicans in the United States and in the Dominican Republic by expanding their access to Health and Education. With the help of a group of Dominicans and Americans, the Dominican Foundation has supported numerous organizations. A particular relationship has forged with the Dominican Institute for Integral Development (IDDI). IDDI is one of the primary development organizations in the Dominican Republic with over 25 years of experience of working with the urban and rural poor in the Dominican Republic.
