  <description>The new Art4Change Canvas is a painting being made in near real-time on the Tom Schreiber Studio homepage at www.tomschreiber.com
Enjoy exploring the new canvas in the coming weeks as it develops with new input from people across the country and around the world.
Sponsor a square to express yourself and be a part of the painting, "Canvas I", 2008-2009. Make payment easily through PayPal. Your square will be created and linked to an online destination of your choice.

Donate to the NRDC here - additionally I'll send 10% of the money earned from square sales in the painting to NRDC to support their efforts in safeguarding our planet.

Thanks to everybody who has participated in this so far and welcome to all of the new people.

cheers! -tom
