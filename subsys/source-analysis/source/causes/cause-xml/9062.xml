  <description>Personally, I feel as though this issue is ignored by the majority of the public. However this issue is real and very much a threat to our country because America is now the fattest country in the world. Looking past the obvious aesthetic advantages to promoting people to stay in shape, a push for American fitness could save as many lives as the fighting of any disease out there. Obesity is at this point classified as an epidemic and it is our duty to do what we can to help fight for a healthier America.  

1. Promote fitness

2. Promote healthier eating

3. Combat eating disorders </description>
