  <description>This group is to help make known the struggles orphans face in Africa. AIDS and HIV are infecting Africa at an alarming rate. Children are left alone daily because their parents pass away from AIDS. Let's make it known and get these children sponsored! Through the power of Christ this can happen. Please don't think you alone can't do something. One person CAN make a difference. These children deserve love and support as much as any other child, why not make a difference. I know YOU can.

Please look at everyorphan.org to find a child to sponsor or find ways to help make an impact and fight HIV/AIDS.

1. Every orphan must be sponsored to survive. 

2. Don't let an orphan slip through the cracks.

3. These children are near and dear to my heart, just by being in this group you are acknowledging these children deserve a change.</description>
