  <description>It is our right to fight for our freedom, peace, and justice.  Worldwide powers are abusing these, and it is a hypocrisy that we collectively need to eradicate.  This group was created to motivate such a campaign that will hopefully be a catalyst to the end of a tyranny we all are suffering from.  We have got to dissolve the wrongful powers and deliver civil rights, justice, and unity.  We are slaves of the government.  It&#8217;s time to get involved; it&#8217;s time to get back our freedom.
