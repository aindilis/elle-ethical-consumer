  <description>dance4life is an international initiative that uses the power of dance to inspire, educate and mobilise young people to take action against HIV and AIDS

WHY: Worldwide, over 33 million people are living with HIV and AIDS and each day thousands of them die from the effects. Almost half of the 7,400 people infected with HIV each day are under the age of 25; this equals 2 teenagers per minute. No surprise, when many young people in the Global South have little knowledge about sexual health and rights; only two out of five teenagers in the Global South know how to protect themselves against HIV. As the single largest group infected and affected by the virus, a huge part of the potential solution lies with young people. That&#8217;s exactly why dance4life involves them.

HOW: Through international schools programmes and media campaigns, dance4life creates awareness, educates, raises political support and funds. The schools programmes are built around a 4 step approach: inspire, educate, activate and celebrate. Young people who have participated in the schools programme become an agent4change, creating social change worldwide.

AIMS &amp; RESULTS: Since its establishment in 2003 dance4life has reached almost 300,000 agents4change. dance4life&#8217;s goal is to facilitate a global youth movement of 1 million agents4change, creating social change in 35 countries by 2014.
