  <description>MYTH OF THE MOTHERLAND is a new documentary film project that will follow a group of young spoken word artists on a creative writing journey to 12 African nations to meet with African scholars, writers, artists and others to address myths and biases about Africa and Africans.

We are raising funds to help send poets to Africa.

For more information and a sample poem called, "For Sudan", written by 19 year old Elizabeth Acevedo, please visit www.myspace.com/mythofthemotherland.



1. Media portrayal as Africans as only victims to war, disease and poverty impede developmental progress.

2. Africa and her people are beautiful, passionate, intellectual and we need to see that as well as the image of Africa's suffering.

3. Spoken word poetry is a powerful and popular medium to promote social change.</description>
