  <description>Imagine a &#8220;campus&#8221; of after-school activities at numerous locations in a specific Providence neighborhood.  This 'campus does not have an specific building or a specific after-school provider.  It does not replace or compete for youth participants with existing providers.  Rather, it is a network of providers in one neighborhood that have made a commitment to work together to provide more opportunities for middle school youth.
