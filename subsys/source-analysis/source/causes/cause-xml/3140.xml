1. Innocent people are dying because of the HFC inhalers.

2. HFC inhalers are GROSSLY INFERIOR to the CFC inhalers.

3. HFC inhalers are about 300% MORE EXPENSIVE than generic CFC inhalers.

4. "Hendeles noted that CFC inhalers release negligible amounts of the propellant, and do NOT pose a threat to ozone depletion." Leslie Hendeles, University of Florida professor of pharmacy and pediatrics, Science Daily March 30 2007. </description>
