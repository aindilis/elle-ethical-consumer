  <description>The Blue Zeal is both a movement and an organization. Our colors represent life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Drawing inspiration from great thinkers like Voltaire, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, and Winston Churchill, we advocate for Equality, Free Thought, Free Speech, Free Love, and Free Enterprise.

More specifically, we are an international network of libertarian thinkers endorsing community service, small government, and the clandestine material support of those waging war against oppression and persecution.

1. Equality

2. Free Thought

3. Free Speech

4. Free Love

5. Free Enterprise</description>
