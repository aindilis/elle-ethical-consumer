  <description>Raise awareness and funds for the fact that hundreds of millions still live in darkness without light at night and gain support to also raise funds to allocate to different beneficiaries or causes and provide help where it is really needed. 

Join our campaign, Live your cause...
We hope to gain enough support to start our own 501C(3), non-profit organization called Free Light Campain.
