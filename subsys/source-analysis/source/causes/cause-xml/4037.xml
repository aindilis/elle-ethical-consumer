  <description>Governments are no longer capable of supplying needed social education, training and facilities to communities even in 1st world countries such as USA. I believe global and local corporations have a larger role to play in sharing the burden of society. This Cause is created to create awareness and urge corporations to get DIRECTLY involved in communities especially where minorities and children are concerned. Every bit helps.

1. Corporations can contribute more to communities which they are involved in

2. Corporations must take responsibility for there actions with regards to environment and stakeholders

3. Corporate Social Responcibility is critical in corporate governance</description>
