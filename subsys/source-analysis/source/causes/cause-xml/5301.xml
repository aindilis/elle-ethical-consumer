  <description>We donate time and money into saving Alana from the outrageous problems that are faced in society today. We are proud to wear "Save Alana" Shirts. It's a picture with Alana's face, and a forest on one side and an ocean on the other. Sometimes we need to chain her up though, because she's a squimer and tries to flee away. She also has been known to have quite an attitude problem when it comes to things like capturing her to keep her safe. We, here at "Save Alana" truly love her, and are dedicated to doing anything we can to help save her. 

1. Alana is good for everyone.</description>
  <mission>Save Alana Andersen because she really needs it. She's dirty, and needs to be cleansed. She's going extinct, and needs to be refuged.</mission>
