  <description>There are many paths offered today that claim to be the path to truth and salvation.

Many paths are offered, for example, Christianity, Paganism, Hinduism, Satanism, Islamism, Atheism, Judaism, Wiccaism, Buddhism etc.

Some people even claim there are many paths to salvation.

Yet Jesus claimed He was the true Path, and He alone.

John 14:6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life...

This means that no other is the true way or path to salvation. Only Jesus is.
