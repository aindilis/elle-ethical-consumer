  <description>The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training is the world's largest endurance sports training program. The program provides training to run or walk marathons and half marathons or participate in triathlons and century (100-mile) bike rides. Since 1988, more than 300,000 volunteer participants have helped raise more than $700 million.

1. On October 21, 2007 I will be running in the Nike Women's Marathon in San Francisco as a member of Team in Training. I have committed to raising $2800 for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, but I would love to meet my goal of $4000 and can't do it without
