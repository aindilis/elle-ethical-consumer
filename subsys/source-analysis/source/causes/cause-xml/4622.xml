  <description>The moment has been anticipated for quite a while already, and it has finally happened. I am pleased to inform you all that the Tuesday Night Club has opened its services up to the greater Durbanville area and surrounds.

For those who study quite a lot and therefore have not heard about the Tuesday Night Club (TNC), here is a brief explanation. The TNC is a free service to the community where the three executive members offer themselves jointly to be hosted for dinner on a Tuesday night. These three members are Trevor "T" Green, Gareth "N" Potter and Myles "C" Coehlo.

Now there are many of you who will say to yourselves: "What is the catch?" There is no catch. It is totally free and you will get all three executive members of the TNC attending your dinner function.

A few of you may be saying: "Why would I want to do this?" Indeed, only a few of you are saying this. In fact, I doubt whether anybody is saying this. However, in the unlikely event that you are saying this, maybe it's time to stop studying and get some fresh air.

If you want to take advantage of this excellent opportunity, please print out the attached form, complete it and return it to the nearest TNC executive member.
