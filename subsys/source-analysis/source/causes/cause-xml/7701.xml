  <description>The Nation, an independantly owned and operated publication, has recently fallen into a significant financial problem.  In an unprecedented move, postal regulators rejected the rate plan submitted by the United States Postal Service in favor of a complex scheme designed by Time Warner, the country's largest publisher!  
The new plan gave much lower increases, or in some cases decreases, to mega-magazines like Time Warner's own Time, People and Sports Illustrated, shifting the burden to smaller publications like The Nation.
The Nation has always been a well respected beacon of free speach and expression.  This move is another nail in the coffin of our civil rights.  Please support The Nation and oppose unjust outrageous postage changes.

1. Create a more equal and just postage rate system for periodicals.

2. Free speach is a protected under the first ammendment.

3. Don't let our country become intollerant to unique ideas.

4. Save The Nation</description>
