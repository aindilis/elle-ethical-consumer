  <description>The Mid-Fairfield AIDS Project (MFAP) was founded in 1987 as an initial response to HIV/AIDS by individuals from a variety of local organizations in co-operation with the Norwalk Health Department and Norwalk Hospital. Now, fifteen years later, Mid-Fairfield AIDS Project provides an array of services and programs.

The Mid-Fairfield AIDS Project is committed to providing quality services in it's efforts to bring much needed care, information, and assistance to those living with, and affected by, HIV/AIDS.

1. MFAP believes that in order to effectively respond to people living with HIV, the program must be comprehensive and address the complexity of the infection, the range of clients&#8217; experiences, and the need of the diverse group.</description>
