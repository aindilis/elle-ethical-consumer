  <description>          Progeria is a disease that causes premature aging in children due to the mutated gene LMNA.  Progeria children don&#8217;t grow up, they grow old.  

Although they are born looking healthy, children with Progeria begin to display many characteristics of accelerated aging at around 18-24 months of age. Progeria signs include growth failure, loss of body fat and hair, aged-looking skin, stiffness of joints, hip dislocation, generalized atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease and stroke.  Most of these children die before their 14th birthday.

These kids need your help!   Donate now to help raise enough money to begin a clinical trial of the new drug found to stop the progression of the disease.  The Progeria Research Foundation needs to raise a total of 2 million dollars to begin treating the children.  So far the foundation has raised 1.4 million.  You can help them achieve that goal to get the treatment to the children as soon as possible.
