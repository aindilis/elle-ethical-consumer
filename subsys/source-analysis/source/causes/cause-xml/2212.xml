  <description>Each day, it seems, more people are being brainwashed by what 'environmentalist' or left wing politicians and speakers are telling them. It's time to take a step back and realize for yourself what is right and what is wrong. Many of these messages have been proven unhelpful, yet the Democrats and liberal media put a bit of a spin on them and people hurry to line up to get brainwashed again. 
I wait for the day when a government comes into office and applies leftist politics on the masses. Talk about a shocker, who would have guessed they were so negative?
If you support what's right and don't mind working hard to achieve your goals, join the cause. 
Also, donate money and then i'll start a party and make everyone a minister.

1. NDP must be eradicated

2. Liberals must be eradicated

3. Choice is a national right</description>
