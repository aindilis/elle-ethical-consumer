  <description>Cystic Fibrosis is a life-altering disease that affects millions of people worldwide.

What is CF?
It is a genetic disease which causes certain glands in the body to work incorrectly. The body produces excess mucus which congests the lungs and blocks the pancreas from providing necessary digestive enzymes to the body.

There is no cure for CF yet, but dozens of treatment methods are in the testing phase. Scientists are making progress, and we have hope for a cure in the future.

Cystic Fibrosis may be a chronic disease with harmful effects, but people with CF can still live a normal lifestyle, and there is hope for a medical breakthrough in the future.

Cystic Fibrosis may not be significant in a majority of people&#8217;s lives, but for those who it does affect, it&#8217;s not just a disease, but a way of life. But one day soon, maybe it won&#8217;t be a lifestyle anymore. Maybe it will be cured, and only known as something that affected people in the past. 

With your support, we can wipe out this disease for good!

1. We need to find a cure for Cystic Fibrosis as quickly as possible.

2. Nobody should have their life controlled by a disease. CF patients miss out on a lot because of their disease, and that's just not fair.</description>
