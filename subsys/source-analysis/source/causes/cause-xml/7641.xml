  <description>The Carolina Climber&#8217;s Coalition was established January 16, 1995 with the purposes of preserving the natural environment, promoting safe climbing practices and preserving climber&#8217;s access to climbing areas in North and South carolina. 

Bill Webster, the first Chair for the CCC answered the most common question from climbers in the Carolinas during the summer of 1995: "What exactly is the Carolina Climber&#8217;s Coalition?" 

"The Coalition was created as a result of a rumor that spread throughout North Carolina in 1994. Climbers mistakenly thought that state parks would be closed to climbing as the result of a fatality at Crowder&#8217;s Mountain. State park officials and climbers met in Charlotte and determined that a park closure was not planned and that a coalition would best serve the interests of both climbers and park officials. In January 1995 almost 100 area climbers voted unanimously to create the coalition to help preserve climbing access in the Carolinas."
