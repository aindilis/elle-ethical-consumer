  <description>Dads Inc. was established on Father's Day 2005 as the only organization in Indiana that provides classes and support for all dads, regardless of race, age or socio-economic background.  Dads Inc. specializes in educational, structured and fun activities for dads and their kids.  

Dads Inc. uniquely has its own social networking site - www.IndyDads.com.  Not only do we reach dads face to face, but we also give them an online community to tap into and get support from.

1. Dads are vital to the successful development of their children.

2. Most dads want to be involved in their kids lives, but many lack the role model, the experience, the opportunity, or the support to do it.</description>
