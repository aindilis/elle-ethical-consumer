  <description>Fight for Jessica is an organization based out of Los Angeles that raises money and awareness for an 11-year-old girl named Jessica Leoni. Jessica is one of only 300 kids in the world that has been afflicted with a fatal neurological disease called Niemann Pick-Type C. Just a few short years ago, Jessica went to school and joyfully danced at her local studio like a regular child. Now, after almost 4 years of aggresive seizures, Jessica can no longer talk or walk. She lost her ability to swallow and now has a feeding tube. Gradually she is losing the mobility of her muscles and joints. As of now, there is no cure. However, Jessica's beautiful smile is a reminder of her courageous spirit. She is hopeful and continues to fight to stay alive. Please join me in the fight for Jessica! For more information visit www.fightforjessica.com.
