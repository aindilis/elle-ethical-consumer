  <description>This cause is very important to me because it is something many people forget about.  We love the animals, but do we really realize how they are being hurt? Thousands of animals are killed every year due to oil spills, forrest fires and lack of neutrition.  These are just three of the many things that have made animals suffer.  If we can just help little by little, we can do a whole lot!!!!

1. Animals need the proper neutrition.

2. We need to stop disasters from happening.

3. We need to stop animals habbitats from being ruined.</description>
