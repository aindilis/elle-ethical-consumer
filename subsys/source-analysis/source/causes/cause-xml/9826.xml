  <description>Care Net is a national, non-profit Christian ministry supporting the work of 1,100 crisis pregnancy centers across the United States and Canada. 

Care Net also jointly owns and operates the Option Line 24/7 call center in Columbus, Ohio. The Option Line is available through phone, e-mail, and AOL instant messanger and offers assistance to callers in English and Spanish. The Option Line provides information about pregnancy, relationships, STDs/STIs, fertility, abortion alternatives, and other sexual health concerns.

Care Net exists to plant, promote, and prepare pregnancy centers to effectively minister to women and men in crisis in their local communities.

1. Every woman and man has a right to be fully informed and their pregnancy and other sexual health related concerns.

2. Irregardless of abortion's legal status, women and men facing unplanned pregnancies should be given access to a full range of support services and abortion alternatives.

3. Abstaining from sexual activity is the only 100% effective way to prevent the contraction of an STD. Prior to entering a permanent, monogamous relationship (i.e. marriage) young people should be encouraged to embrace a chaste lifestyle.</description>
