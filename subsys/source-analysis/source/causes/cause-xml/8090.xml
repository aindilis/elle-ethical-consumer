  <description>It is obvious that global warming is the biggest threat our Earth has ever seen. We must take action to slow and stop climate change. This club will be based at the University of Saskatchewan, however can include members that are not students. Meetings will be held monthly, as will events. For this club to operate, 75 percent of the members must be U of S undergrad students, who will vote for a president, vice president, secretary and treasurer. If you are interested in becoming a member or executive member, and are a u of s student, please send me a message (Gabrielle Legault) or email me at gabrielle668@hotmail.com. Remember, taking action is easy and requires little effort for a great reward.

1. Many small steps against global warming equals a large step

2. We can create change!

3. Global Warming has become a prioroty to our government and should also be priority for the University.</description>
