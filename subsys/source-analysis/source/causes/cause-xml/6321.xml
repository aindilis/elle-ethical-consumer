  <description>Close your eyes, and imagine the following...

You're a poor logger child at Pueblano.  You wake up every day at the butt crack of dawn to hike 12 miles up Wilson Mesa where you climb spar poles, cut down trees, and learn everything else about being a logger.  After 12 hours of hard manual labor you hike another 18 miles back up to Pueblano.  Once you're home you go right to the pantry looking for something to eat, but there are NO BAKED GOODS!

Have some humanity.  Send baked goods to the logger children at Pueblano.  Address:

Logger Children c/o The Pueblano Boys
47 Caballo Rd.
Philmont Scout Ranch
Cimarron, NM 87714
