  <description>Growing up as a heart patient is generally a difficult task.  For me, when I was little there wasn't much technology out there for surgery or special medications like they have out today.  It was hard being told that as a child you would have to watch what activities you did or what you ate or how much time you spent in the heat.   Today children with heart diseases don't have to worry to much about that - Thanks to the Heart and Stroke Foundation they continue to make the lives of those who have suffered from or are going through treatment for heart related illnesses a more enjoyable one. 

Join the Heart and Stroke Foundation today and assist me in raising money and promoting awareness for a great cause!
