  <description>Saving animals back skin, they need their skin, like we need ours. What if someone ripped your skin, right off you, when you were alive, and wore your skin, as their new winter coat. Please, help save baby white seals, panda bears, they are soon to be extinct. Think about the loss of animals in our food chain. And yes they are just animals, but they feel, and eat, and breathe. They cry when they are in pain. Please, show your support
