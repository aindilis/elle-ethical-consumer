  <description>Our primary mission is to give scholarships to deprived young children in rural Southeast Asia and other areas of the world so they may continue their education at local public schools, thus aiding school attendance beyond the required minimum education.

Darunee Fund supports self-reliance of people in developing countries and is involved in the development of projects to support education across international boundaries. These projects include the building of schools in Laos and Thailand, the Abacus Project and income generating programs in rural areas.

Darunee Fund scholarships (usually in the amount of $100) allows a child to continue her or his middle school or primary school education for one full year. Other funds are used to build schools in rural areas that have no school buildings, assist with teacher education, or provide necessary school supplies.

Donations of any amount are welcome and sincerely appreciated.



1. All children have the right to attend elementary and middle school.

2. Education provides opportunities. 

3. Every donation can change the life of a child.</description>
