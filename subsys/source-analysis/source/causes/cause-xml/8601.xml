  <description>In my neighborhood, there are many places for animals to roam because I live near a forest. But lately, i haven't seen the animals in the forest. I've seen them in the streets. Though my neighborhood is very nice, the cars driving through do not pay attnetion to the speed limit. Because of this, many animals are dying. Some become orphans and can't provide on their own because their mother has died. What I want to do is make drivers more aware of their surrounds to protect our wildlife.

1. Inforce the speed limit more so.

2. put in a stop light.

3. decrease speed limit</description>
