  <description>When I first heard about what is going on in Portugal, I was completely shocked and appalled that someone would abduct such a helpless little three-year-old girl. For those of you who aren't aware of the goings on, here is a brief description. On May 3rd 2007 in Praia Da Luz, near the Algarve in Portugal. a young girl named Madeline McCann was abducted(or so believed) but police believe she still remains between 3 and 5 km away AND IS ALIVE. There is currently a &#163;2,500,00 reward for the safe return of Madeline but there are still no leads in the investigation apart from an artist's loose interpretation of the culprit.

Please please help this girl and invite all your friends to this cause.
It will hopefully be worth it when Madeline is returned to her family.

1. Promote knowledge of the happenings in Portugal

2. Give love and support to all related or known to Madeline

3. BRING HER BACK</description>
