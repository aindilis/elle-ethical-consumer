  <description>The small house movement is championed by the Small House Society. The society builds new-age houses that are all compact and economical. They significantly decrease the waste produced by ostentious estates. 

1. The new trend is BIG everything, including houses

2. I'm ashamed of Americans and America - the land of consumerism.

3. David Thoreau lived in a small house in the woods.
