  <description>Everyday trees are being cut down. Animals are quickly losing their habitats. We must help. We want our children to be able to know and see a beautiful tiger or penguin. What would a world without animals be? Take a second and think about that. Some of you may be thinking, "I really don't care. They are just animals." Okay, let me put it this way.... Let's say you're daughter is sick. If she is in an unstable environment she could get worse. That is how it is for many of our endagered species. There are a lot of causes out there for humans who need food and shelter, but very few organizations for animals who need the same thing.

Since 1961 the World Wildlife Fund has been protecting our beautiful envrionment and the animals we share it with. Please help. Any donation is a good donation.

It's not to late to donate today for a better tomorrow. Thank you.




1. We need to stop cutting down trees and animal habitats.

2. Fur is bad. Stop making clothes out of innocent animals.

3. There are not enough organizations for animals.

4. With temperatures increasing exponentially, endagered animals are losing their habitats.</description>
