  <description>If one looks around at the world, one will find many fucked-up situations and fucked-up people and beliefs that cause these situations to unfold. People in this group believe that instead of everyone trying to fix, or save, other people we believe that if every single one of the people on this earth looked inside themselves and re-arranged all the feelings, and beliefs, and ideas, they could all find some sort of inner peace where everything is beautiful, and nothing hurts, and then the world would be a beautiful place. In other words, dive into the lotus flower, and come out enlightened.

1. Peace can be found within oneself

2. Peace on the inside will create peace on the outside

3. Every person can achieve peace</description>
