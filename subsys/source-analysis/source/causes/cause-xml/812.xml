  <description>Operation Iraqi Children has changed to: Operation International Children.

Operation International Children (OIC) is a grassroots program that provides school supplies, toys and sports equipment to children in Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries with children in need. 

OIC was co-founded in 2004 by actor Gary Sinise (Forrest Gump, CSI: NY) and author Laura Hillenbrand (Seabiscuit: An American Legend). This program was created to provide concerned Americans with a means to reach out to the children in Iraq and to help support our troops&#8217; efforts to assist the Iraqi people. 

Five years after founding OIC to help troops bring school supplies to Iraqi children, we have expanded our mission to include children in areas all over the world served by American troops.  As we continue our extensive efforts in Iraq, we are now sending school supplies and other necessities to troops in Afghanistan and other nations, for distribution to needy children.  We intend to further broaden our mission in the future.

In recognition of our efforts, OIC was voted &#8220;Best Bridge Builder&#8221; of 2006 by Reader&#8217;s Digest Magazine and has received an official letter of endorsement from the White House.
