  <description>Alive in Baghdad was formed to counter the sound-bite driven, "Live From" news model. Through the work of a team of Americans and Iraqi correspondents on the ground, Alive in Baghdad shows the occupation through the voices of Iraqis. Alive in Baghdad brings testimonies from individual Iraqis, footage of daily life in Iraq, and short news segments from Iraq to you.

The Urbana-Champaign Media Center is the fiscal sponsor for Alive in Baghdad.

1. Educate the public about current conditions in Iraq.

2. Provide real stories of Iraqi citizens effected by war.</description>
