  <description>Crohn&#8217;s Disease is a bowel disease that causes scarring and thickening in the intestinal walls. It frequently leads to stomach pain, diarrhea and urgency to use the bathroom.  One thing about Crohn&#8217;s is that it is chronic which actually means that it doesn&#8217;t go away and you won&#8217;t just grow out of it.

Colitis is a bowl disease in your colon, your large intestine or bowel. Colitis causes inflammation and sores, called ulcers, in the top layers of the lining of the large intestine. Ulcerative colitis rarely affects the small intestine except for the lower section, called the ileum. Colitis is also chronic which means that it won't go away.
