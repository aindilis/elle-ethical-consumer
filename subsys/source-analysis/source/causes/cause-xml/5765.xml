  <description>The amount of petroleum used to make a single plastic bag can drive a car about 11 meters.

Biobags are 100% biodegradeable and compostable bags. Biobags are made from corn starch, biodegradeable polymer and other renewable resources, using no polyethylene in the production process and GMO free. Biobags also use soybased inks and dyes.

Biobags decompose in 10-40 days.

Please encourage stores to use Biobags rather than plastic bags.
