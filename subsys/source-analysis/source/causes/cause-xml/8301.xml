  <description>Every year billions of animals specially in Latin America, Asia and Africa are prey of illegal trafficking. These animals are subject to various cruel treatments. For every ONE animal that arrives in Europe/US there are 10 that DIED! If we don't do anything NOW Latin America's, Asia's and Africa's environment will be affected forever and LOTS of animals will be EXTINCT! Don't forget that extinction is FOREVER!!

The jungles of Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and Brazil, and other fragile ecosystems of Central America, Mexico, Argentina and Paraguay, have become the main sources of wild species trafficking to the European Union, the world's leading destination for reptile skins, parrots, boa, python snakes, and the second for monkeys.
