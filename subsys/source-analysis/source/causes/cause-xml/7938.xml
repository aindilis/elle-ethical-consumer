  <description>Our Goals:

To raise awareness in the media of digital rights abuses
To provide a media clearinghouse, connecting journalists with experts and activists
To preserve and extend traditional civil liberties in the digital world
To collaborate with other digital rights and related organisations
To nurture a community of campaigning volunteers, from grassroots activists to technical and legal experts

November 2007:
For a limited time only, Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust is matching each extra pound we raise with another free pound of their own. That means they double your money! Please consider giving a little extra, to help us make the most of this generous offer.

DO NOT donate here; Causes won't send the money to ORG as it's not a US charity. Instead use this page:

1. Government databases must be constrained

2. DRM destroys value - we oppose it

3. Net Neutrality - mere conduit status preserved

4. Computerised voting is insecure, opaque and badly designed; it destroys trust in the democratic process</description>
