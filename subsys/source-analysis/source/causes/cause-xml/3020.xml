  <description>This cause was created to recognize and support those of us who chose to major in Theatre/Music Theatre as opposed to doing something practical, those of us who have devoted our lives to performing, though we all end up waiting tables at one point or another, and those of us who are willing to do anything and everything they can to raise awareness for the performing arts.

1. The performing arts deserve respect and support

2. Performing Artists deserve so much respect for their undying love for their art

3. We have Patti Lupone. Enough said.</description>
