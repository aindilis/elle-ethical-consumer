  <description>This cause is one of a demand to stop the morally wrongness of drinking and driving. Drinking and driving have killed many people and hopfully this site can help stop it. I wish to raise money to give to bars in the area to put into a taxi cab safe for drunkers to use when they are completely trashed.

1. Stop underage drinking and driving

2. Make the drinking and driving law better

3. Have limits at bars for beer and liquor</description>
