  <description>With peer pressure, negative role models and the tough challenges girls face today, your donation can change a girl's world forever.

Your gift to Girl Scouts of the San Fernando Valley is one that will help girls realize their dreams and become our leaders of tomorrow. 

There are several ways to give needed support for Girl Scouting:  through our annual Family Giving campaign, through a personal or corporate donation, or through becoming a Volunteer.  Every gift is a gift for girls.  

Financial contributions provide camperships, scholarship, materials, training, and more.  In fact, $.80 of every dollar goes directly to Program Opportunities for girls.

Thanks for your support!
