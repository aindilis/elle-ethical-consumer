  <description>Nietzsche boldly proclaimed that, "God is dead".  He cogently traced the development of human society and the arbitrary, ever-shifting morality that goes along with it.  He viewed religions as negative forces that are mis-guided morality, systems of control, and a pacifying agent for the human herd.

Without religion imposing what's ultimately a baseless, and arbitrary set of moralities we are left in a relativist world where we must create our own morality.  We are left to embrace our humanity, and to be whatever it is we discover ourselves to be.

Any ideology, or system of beliefs must be viewed as temporally, geographically, and personally subjective.  Any truth is falsifiable, and so to none should we cling.  We must dance between, and through truths as we continually search for something we'll never, and can't ever find.

1. God is dead.

2. Humans are animals; nothing more, nothing less.

3. We can each be our own "saviour" by relentlessly expressing our individual wills.</description>
