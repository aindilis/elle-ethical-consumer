  <description>This cause is not directed at genuine and or true friendships

This cause goes out to girls/women who go clubbin, bbqs or other events with "unattractive females" just so that they can be the main attraction.

*ladies these actions do not make you more desireable all they do is make ur so called friends look less desireable. 

And also it gives these girls a false sense of security, as in now these "unattractive females" start acting like they hot and forgetting all about having a good personality.

cause it is only so long that wearing baby phat n having ur weave cover ur face (or wearing big shades) can work

So if you think your hot, hang around other hotgirls to see wats really good. the test is if when u wake up, if ur not sexy then ur just not sexy!!! Real sexy girls/women can go in the grocery store wit a t-shirt n track pants n still turn heads

If you aint hot,DO NOT PUT ON MORE MAKE-UP just be  nice and maybe nice things might come ur way


1. Fine girls/women should have fine friends

2. What you wear does NOT determine your level of sexiness

3. Drunk males should not drink in the presense of "unattractive females"</description>
