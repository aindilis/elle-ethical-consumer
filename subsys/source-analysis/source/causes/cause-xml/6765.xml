  <description>Hi, we are a new instalment of the Drug Salvage organisation. You may have seen or heard Carly (the founder)talking about Drug Salvage and what we are about in magazines such as Dolly or on your local radio station. We are an organisation focused on getting out more information about drugs. We feel that it is important for the information available to be informative, but also interesting and from the point of veiw of people who know first hand. Not politicians or people who have no idea but people like me who have used and been affected and as a result feel that others who want help, information or just someone who understands, should have a non-judgemental organisatition to do so. 

if you would like to help you can email carly personally at
