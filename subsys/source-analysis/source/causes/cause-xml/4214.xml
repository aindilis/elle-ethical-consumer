  <description>In 1989, Sting and Trudie Styler founded The Rainforest Foundation in response to a direct request for help from a Kayapo Indian leader
in Brazil who was seeking to protect his peoples' land and culture. The organization's initial project led to a role coordinating the first ever privately funded demarcation of Indian land in the region.
Since that time, the Rainforest Foundation has grown into a network of organizations working in a dozen countries around the globe. In 1996, the Rainforest Foundation established independent offices in New York, Oslo and London, as well as the Rainforest Foundation Fund.

1. The mission of the Rainforest Foundation is to support indigenous and traditional people of the world's rainforests in their efforts to protect their environment and fulfill their rights by assisting them in:

2. Securing and controlling the natural resources necessary for their long term well being and managing these resources in ways which do not harm their environment, violate their culture or compromise their future; and

3. Developing the means to protect their individual and collective rights and to obtain, shape and control basic services from the state.</description>
