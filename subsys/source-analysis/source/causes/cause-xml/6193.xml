  <description>My band and I are in need of a lot of new equipment, and it would mean a lot if you were to simply join our cause, it's great that u care and u are in no way obligated to help rob anyplace, or donate money, we are just in need of moral support.

1. The Man is bringin' us DOWN!

2. Corporal America deserves to be ROBBED!

3. WE THE PEOPLE...DESERVE MORE!!!</description>
