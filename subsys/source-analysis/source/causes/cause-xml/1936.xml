  <description>Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) has been committed to wetland conservation for more than 65 years. Despite this, wetland loss continues across Canada. As much as 70 per cent of Canada&#8217;s original wetlands have been lost in some areas of the country.

DUC&#8212;a national, private, non-profit organization&#8212;is Canada&#8217;s Conservation Company. It&#8217;s a responsibility DUC does not take lightly. 

DUC&#8217;s conservation efforts take many forms. On-the-ground work is guided by the wetland and environmental research of DUC&#8217;s scientists. DUC works to change policy in favour of wetland and habitat conservation. DUC also delivers wetland and environmental education programs to teach Canadians about wetlands and the need to conserve them.

As a non-profit organization, DUC relies on the support of Canadians from across the country. DUC&#8217;s dedicated volunteers, members and staff work very hard to help DUC in achieving its conservation mission and vision.
