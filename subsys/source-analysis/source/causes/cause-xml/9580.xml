  <description>People Breed their pets, have fun with the puppies or kittens and when they realize they can not keep them they consider selling them a sollution!
Well it's not! you only encourage the animal trading business by doing so! 
Neuter and spay your pets and help control the cats and dogs population, millions of dogs and cats are killed everyday because they don't have homes! Stop encouraging the concept of selling and buying pets and help stop those traders from abusing animals for the purpose of making money out of selling them.
Stop breeding your pets, there are more than enough already out there and they are homeless!stop selling and buying pets and encourage free adoption!
