  <description>After 20 years of renting schools and occupying the O'Grady household, Fantasy Works Youth Theatre is in search of a home. This home will be a Rhode Island Center for the Arts. But it needs your help. As a not-for-profit organization, Fantasy Works is looking for donations from the people it supports to help it in this endeavor. Help create a new center for the arts and give FW a home!
