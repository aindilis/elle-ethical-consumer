  <description>We are working toward ending the electrocutions in the TJ pound and offer the resources needed for the humane treatment of the dogs which are brought to the pound. Currently a portion of our resources are dedicated to ceasing the use of electrocution as a means of "euthanizing" the unwanted dogs in Tijuana. We provide the euthanol and our trained volunteers and veterinarian technicians to offer a gentle passing for the dogs which would otherwise suffer the inhumane use of electrocution. We are seeking the funding to continue our work and provide the resources for a humane passing for the dogs of the TJ pound each and every day.
