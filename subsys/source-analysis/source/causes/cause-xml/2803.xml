  <description>Being hit, Being abandoned,Being neglected,Being Abused, Being murdered just because you are homeless,being confined,being bred against your will are all against the law! IF YOU ARE HUMAN!
Yet all of this is acceptable if you are an animal and so much more! People treat animals as disposable. Ignorant people dispose,abandon,abuse,torture,
breed puppies over and over again! Alll of this has to STOP! A pet gives so much more than some humans are capable of! Love, obedience,
companionship,loyalty. 

1. Stop Breeding when there are so many unwanted animals in our shelters.

2. Animals are in need open your heart and home to one adopt a pet!

3. Spay and Neuter and do the right thing!</description>
