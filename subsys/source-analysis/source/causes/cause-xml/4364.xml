  <description>When my son was born, I was not working and was struggling on my own and by myself.  After Gregory passed away at six months of age, I found myself devistated with nothing and no where to turn.  My family wanted me to get up and work right away, so I found a job at Children's Hospital and worked there for a while, but it hurt so bad and one day I just couldn't work anymore due to my grief.

At that point I started thinking about things I wanted to do and one of them was go back to school.  College has helped define who I am and helped me to grow in a way that I don't think any counseling or medication could help.  I'm going to counseling and on a medication through another program, but the main challenge is getting funds for college.  If there was a scholarship out there for bereaved parents of CDH children, or other infant loss, it would really help those in need like myself.

I need help, but also I would like to help others who are in the same predicament.  So if any of you could have it in your heart to donate some money to this fund and hold this cause at heart, you will be helping people get an education and become better members of society, or the leaders of tomorrow.

1. Bereaved parents should occupy their time with learning.

2. People who lost a child and cannot work, need to get a scholarship for college.

3. Going to college after the loss of my son has helped me to grow immensely.</description>
