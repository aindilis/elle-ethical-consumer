  <description>The real Free Enterprise Society was formed in 1979.  A small group of individuals noticed the simultaneous expansion of bureaucracy, erosion of individual rights, and plunder of private wealth by slick government debt and taxing schemes.  this enfringments on the public's lives created a great deal of concern.

Unlike groups that merely paid lip service to freedom, Free Enterprise Society put their money where their mouth was. With their homes, jobs, and reputations at stake, Free Enterprise Society members held official authority accountable under the United States Constitution, which is the Supreme Law of the Land in this country. Many of these challenges went into the courts. There were both wins and losses. The wins we celebrated; the losses were studied very carefully to prevent their repetition.

The Free Enterprise Society provides seminars and study courses, that detail lawful ways of avoiding intolerable debt and tax burdens.  Their constant strive to educate and liberate people is present everywhere in our society today, but much of it goes completly unnoticed and unfourtunatly it remains uncommon knowledge 
today becaus of it.
