  <description>This cause is to help support the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund who maintain the Wall in Washington, D.C. They also provide a miniature replica that tours to cities so that veterans of The 'Nam who can't make it to D.C. can still experience the healing and closure that the Wall brings.

1. Support this means of closure and healing

2. Support the Touring Wall for veterans who can't make it to DC</description>
