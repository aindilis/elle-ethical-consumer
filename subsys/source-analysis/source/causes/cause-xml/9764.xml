  <description>Through the thoughtful administration of contributions and the dedication of volunteers, the Father Fred Foundation shares its resources and caring with the mentally and physically distressed, the poor, the hungry, and those suffering from unforeseen challenges. 

1. We serve the residents of Antrim, Benzie, Kalkaska, Leelanau and Grand Traverse Counties

2. The Foundation assists with: food, clothing, furniture, household items, utility shut-offs and other emergency financial assistance

3. The Foundation is often the last resort for people who have tried to get help elsewhere but could not. We try to listen to their problems, empathize with their situations and help them in any way we can

4. We typically assist between 75 and 125 people each day of operation.</description>
