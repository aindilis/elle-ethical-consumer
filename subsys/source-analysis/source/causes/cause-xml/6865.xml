  <description>Global Warming affects our public health and national security. It&#8217;s an urgent matter of survival for everyone on the planet-the most urgent threat facing humanity today. It&#8217;s going to take action from you and all of us working together.
The massive ice sheets in the Arctic are melting at alarming rates. This is causing the oceans to rise. That&#8217;s how big these ice sheets are! Most of the world&#8217;s population lives on or near the coasts. Rising ocean levels, an estimated six feet over the next 100 years or sooner, will cause massive devastation and economic catastrophe to population centers worldwide.
