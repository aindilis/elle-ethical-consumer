  <description> From the greak word Synergos...meaning "working together." 

-Refers to the phenomenon in which two or more discrete influences or agents acting together create an effect greater than that predicted by knowing only the separate effects of the individual agents.

The Vision:
To create a more friendly community based upon the ideals of love, respect, and generosity, therefore enabling all to work together more effectively and with integrity. 

In other words...

Make EMORY one of the friendliest campus' in the nation.

Imagine a world where people held doors open for eachother, said hello as they walked on by, sitting with a stranger at lunch, or something as simple as offering a smile.

Quotes from Emory students:

&#8220;If there's one thing that is lacking at Emory, but really in the whole world for that matter, its common decency and mutual respect.&#8221; 

&#8220;One of Emory's student strengths is also its weakness-the independence of its students. It&#8217;s important that we're a very self-reliant group, but that also makes us a very self-absorbed group at times too.&#8221; 
------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's change that! Why wait to be nice? Why not make a little extra effort? 
Are you smiling? 

1. Love, respect, and generosity are crucial
