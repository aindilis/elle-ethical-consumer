  <description>Campus Pride represents the only national nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization for student leaders and campus groups working to create a safer college environment for LGBT students. The organization is a volunteer-driven network "for" and "by" student leaders. The primary objective of Campus Pride is to develop necessary resources, programs and services to support LGBT and ally students on college campuses across the United States.

Founded in the Fall of 2001 and launched a year later in October of 2002, Campus Pride started as an online community and resource clearinghouse under the name Campus PrideNet.  The original founding partners were M. Chad Wilson, Sarah E. Holmes &amp; Shane L. Windmeyer. In 2006, the organization broadened its outreach efforts and restructured as the current educational non-profit organization Campus Pride.  As part of the restructuring process, the Lambda 10 Project for LGBT Fraternity &amp; Sorority Issues (www.lambda10.org) became an educational initiative of Campus Pride.  The executive director is national LGBT civil rights leader and campus pioneer Shane L. Windmeyer.
