  <description>AIGA, the professional association for design, is committed to furthering excellence in design as a broadly defined discipline, strategic tool for business and cultural force. AIGA will be the place design professionals turn to first to exchange ideas and information, participate in critical analysis and research and advance education and ethical practice. It will be the preeminent professional association for design in the United States and a respected source of information on the value of design and the process of design innovation. It will celebrate design excellence in the craft of designing artifacts of beauty and great effect as well as the value created by designing as a strategic way of thinking. AIGA's principal purposes are to develop respect and understanding for the value created through the contributions of designers, so that designers are respected, valued and able to succeed well into the future.

As graphic artists and designers, we are constantly looking towards the future, yet at times, we forget that the AIGA is supporting our efforts. Show some love, open your wallets, and donate!
