  <description>Jagercure was created in April 2007 to raise money for Light the Night, a walk created by the Leukemia and Lymphoma society. The original inspiration for the project came from Andrew McMahon, lead singer for Something Corporate and Jack's Mannequin, who was diagnosed with Acute Lymphatic Leukemia back in June 2005. 

The verb "jagen" means to hunt and a jagermeister is a master hunter. So basically, jagercure = hunting for a cure. If you stretch your imagination a bit.

Right now Jagercure is just beginning and buttons are being created as we speak. Please spread the word.

1. Every cancer deserves a cure.</description>
