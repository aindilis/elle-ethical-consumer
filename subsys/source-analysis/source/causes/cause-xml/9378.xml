  <description>NightLight: a ministry in urban Bangkok, which reaches out to women and children working in the bar areas of Nana/Sukhumvit. Located in a neighborhood with a growing sex trade, Nightlight&#8217;s vision is to share the Light of the world in both word and deed to those who live in darkness.

To Combat the sexual exploitation of Women and Children (Thai and Foreign) in the Nana/Sukhumvit area.

Through life-on-life ministry, NightLight&#8217;s goal is to meet the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of women in prostitution, their children, and those children brought illegally in Thailand to financially support their families by selling items in the bars and often through sexual exploitation. These goals will be met through building relationships with women and children who work in the sex trade industry along the Nana/Sukhumvit area and by providing a center that offers emergency aid, educational and employment opportunity, emergency child-care, language tutoring, literacy training, and biblical teaching and healing for their community.

2. Vocational/Educational Opportunities: Providing employment, job training and educational alternatives

3. Shelter and Assistance: To provide a safe place for emergency assistance, health care, counseling, child-care and basic necessities.</description>
