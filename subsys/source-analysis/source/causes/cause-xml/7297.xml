  <description>People who raise money to Darfur actually only raise money to advertise their organization so they get more money to advertise how they think whats going on in Darfur is wrong. The government can't do anything lest to ruin whatever reputation it has left. So why don't those whiny !$@$ers just go to Darfur themselves and help out? I know! Because they don't actually care enough!
