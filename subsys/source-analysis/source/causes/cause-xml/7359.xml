  <description>The goals of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.maasaigirlseducation.org"&gt;Maasai Girls Education Fund (MGEF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; are to get girls in school and to keep them there until they have the knowledge and skills to get a job in Kenya. 

Through scholarships, life skills workshops, and community education programs, MGEF is realizing its vision of a better life for Maasai women through education.

MGEF works in partnership with the community, including local area chiefs and women advocates for education of girls, to address social and cultural institutions, such as early marriage and female circumcision, which sustain illiteracy among women, contribute toward the spread of HIV/AIDS, perpetuate poverty, and result in the marginalization of the Maasai in Kenya.

&lt;i&gt;MGEF sponsored a ceremony for students who acheived an A average during the past school year. Two of those students are pictured above.&lt;/i&gt;
