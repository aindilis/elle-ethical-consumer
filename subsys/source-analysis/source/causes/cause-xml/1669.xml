  <description>Skate4Cancer was born of love and a dream.

Please visit http://www.skate4cancer.com for the history on this charity, events you can attend, ways to donate, and more, as all the information exceeds the Facebook Cause Description settings.

skate4cancer will continue so long as the fight against cancer remains unresolved. If people wish to donate to the cause, we will continue to skate. If people have yet to hear of our cause, we will continue to tour.

Dream. Love. Cure.
