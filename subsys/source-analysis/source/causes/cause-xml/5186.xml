  <description>If you support greater increased international, economic, military  cooperation between the nations of Canada, the United States, and Mexico.

 Canada and Mexico are now the two largest exporters of oil, natural gas, and electricity to the United States. Since 9/11, we are not only one another&#8217;s major commercial partners, a North America Union would us less vulnerable to terrorist attack.With a union we will be better at meeting the rising economic theart of China and the EU 

PS: a union would not mean America, Cananda, and Mexico giving up their country's Identity. It would just mean we join together like a union(think EU). So the three country would still send rep to the UN.
