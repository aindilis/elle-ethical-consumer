  <description>There are over 2000 people groups that do not have the Bible translated into their language.  Our College class, at First Baptist Church in Cary, NC, has promised to raise $2000 to translate 100 verses of the Bible into the Rikou language.  The Rikou people are natives to Indonesia.

To help raise money for this cause, we are holding a Car Wash at FBC on June 16th, 2007.   Also, we are creating this Facebook Cause in hopes that proceeds will be raised to help contribute to the translation project.

Our goal is not to contribute to only the Rikou language, but to any and all languages that do not yet have a Bible.

1. To spread the gospel of Jesus Christ to all peoples of the World!

2. To give each people group a Bible they can see, read and touch!

3. To prove that even with $20, you can make a change in thousands of peoples lives!</description>
