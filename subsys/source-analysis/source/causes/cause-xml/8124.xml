  <description>Many people nowadays are affected by AIDS, even if they don't know it. A friend or loved one might have AIDS or even you personally. But AIDS isn't just for the affected anymore. We're in a new generation now and its our turn to bat. We need to bring attention to this epidemic so we can halt it in its tracks. Help raise awareness, help raise money, help advocate the cause. Because AIDS is a race...join the human race against AIDS. Together, we can all win.

Hey. I'm Zay. I don't have a Facebook nor a Myspace, but I do have a life. Up until around a year ago, I was that guy your mom warned you about. The high-school dropout, junkie. Now I stopped the drugs, but not in time. I have AIDS. I'm going to die. But that doesn't stop me living. I go from place to place and talk about AIDS, advocate a drug-free America. I have a fiancee I love and who loves me and a career I love as well as an evening job I enjoy. AIDS is a part of my life, but not the defining factor. Help bring this to a stop. Maybe we won't be in time to save me, but it'd be easier knowing that we were doing everything we could to make sure that not many follow my path.
