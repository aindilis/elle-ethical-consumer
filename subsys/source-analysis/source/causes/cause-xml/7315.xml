  <description>A Hand Hug is a unique expression of love. It's basically a hug given with your hand by wrapping your thumb around another person's hand. It's different from a regular hug because it just involves using your hand. You can give a Hand Hug to your friends, co-workers, peers, or anyone who has a hand. Hand Hugs cheer up people's days and allow you to connect with them.

1. We do not discourage a regular hug just other an alternative way of hugging people.

2. You can not properly Hand Hug yourself.</description>
