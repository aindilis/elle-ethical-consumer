  <description>Since its inception, Team Diabetes Canada participants have raised vital funds on behalf of the Canadian Diabetes Association and the 2 million Canadians with diabetes that the Association serves.

Team Diabetes participants not only increase public awareness of the disease, they inspire their communities to get active and involved. They create lifestyle changes that reduce the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, while raising funds in support of the research, education, advocacy, and programming that the Canadian Diabetes Association delivers in communities across Canada. Team Diabetes participants are local heroes working to prevent diabetes at home and abroad.

Team Diabetes programs allow you to walk or run in world-class marathon events in fascinating cities both nationally and throughout the World.

I would like to participate in honour of my family members who are affected by this disease. TO SUPPORT MY MISSION PLEASE CLICK ON THE LINK BELOW:

Participant Name: Tara Kavelman
City of Residence: Brantford

My fundraising goal is $6100, which means I must raise this amount to participate in the marathon, which takes place August 18th! I have raised over $5200 so far, so with your help, I will make it!! Please donate! It would mean the world to me.

1. Canadians must be made more aware that Type 2 diabetes is preventable. </description>
