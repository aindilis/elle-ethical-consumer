  <description>Feline Leukemia is a retrovirus that attacks a cats immune system.  It is almost like HIV except in cats &amp;&amp; can be transferred through many things other than sex &amp;&amp; blood.  In the United States, approximately 2-3% of all cats are infected with Feline Leukemia.  Cats that are ill or very young are higly at risk of getting the infection.  The infection can be spread through feces, urine, milk, saliva, nasal secretions, &amp;&amp; from a mother cat to her kittens.  Many people have had cats that have died from this disease.  I am one of them &amp;&amp; i hope you can help so someday someone will find a cure for Feline Leukemia which could also lead to a cure for HIV. 

1. It kills thousands of cats each year.

2. You could lose your cat because of it.

3. If you have more than one cat &amp;&amp; one is infected, the others are likely to be infected as well.</description>
