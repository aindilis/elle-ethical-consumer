  <description>To abolish and destroy ignorant thought and to educate people to not discriminant, stereotype or be blind towards certain people or groups. 

Ignorance in the face of race or religion is of no excuse in our modern society.

Ignorance against not only people but actions against  nations and groups is just as wrong. (i.e. watching a genocide go on in our world and being blind to it, reluctant for action against its resolution)

1. Ignorance holds people back.

2. Ignorance hurts all people.

3. Ignorance is.

4. Ignorance should be no longer.</description>
