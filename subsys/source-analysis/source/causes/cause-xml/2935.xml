  <description>My mom was diagnosed with Optical Nerve and Sinus cancer, a cancer that is so rare it does not even have a medical name. While undergoing a 22 and half hour open head surgery with the pretty much gaurantee of going blind, came out with almost 20/20 vision in each eye. She is a survivor, and I want to help everyone else with this cancer to become as brave and couragous as my mom! Me and my sister nad 3 other people have already shaved our heads for her. We made a fund called the Naked Noggin Fund. Spread the word, or give a donation, everything is greatly appreciated. 

1. Give hope to those who have to struggle with this cancer.

2. Give funds towards the research to find more evidence of this type of Cancer

3. Get more naked noggins, whether a victim or not.</description>
