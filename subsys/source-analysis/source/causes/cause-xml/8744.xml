Weinberg rose to success as the drummer for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, joining in 1974 after answering a newspaper ad that famously requested "no junior Ginger Bakers" in reference to Baker's long drum solo reputation. Weinberg's consistent beat solved the E Street Band's drumming instabilities.
