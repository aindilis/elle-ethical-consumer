  <description>Females United for Self-Esteem Development (FUSED) is a non-profit organization established in 2007 to promote self-esteem development through awareness, prevention, intervention and empowerment programs.  

Our programs include personal development camps, workshops, mentorship opportunities, networking events, and media campaigns.   As a 100% volunteer-based organization, FUSED&#8217;s programs are organized and executed by young professionals who volunteer as role models and mentors to local, minority youth.  Our volunteers are valuable sources of support to children by modeling strong values, providing career and educational guidance, and teaching leadership and social skills.  

FUSED believes that youths are the future; therefore, we aspire to empower youths to become social entrepreneurs of the future.
