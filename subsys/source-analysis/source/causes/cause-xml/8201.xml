  <description>What is it with people supporting the troops when they have no idea what the troops are doing? The reality that most Americans don't want to recognise is that American troops are killing people everyday in Iraq. The country is much worse now that it was before American interference. So we need to stop supporting the troops right now.


1. USA must leave Iraq now

2. USA must make a formal apology

3. USA must pay hefty fines for starting an illegal war and causing mass destruction.</description>
