  <description>By using sport as a vehicle for social change, Special Olympics Virginia strives to create opportunities for meaningful interaction and self discovery for every member of the community. Our goal is to open the heart and mind of all Virginians to the value and ability of individuals with intellectual disability. Guided by 8 regional offices, our corps of 20,000 volunteers helps run 28 local area programs that support more than 9,400 Special Olympians as they develop physical fitness, compete with courage, experience joy and showcase their achievement. In addition to year-round training and competition, we have several sub-programs including the Global Messenger program (athlete leadership training), our Urban program (for inner-city athletes) and Young Athletes (for children aged 2 to 7 and their parents).
