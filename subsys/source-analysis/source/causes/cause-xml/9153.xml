  <description>By brother, he used to not talk, now he does. That is good, but now he talks too much. I cannot get this child to shut up. He drives everyone around him crazy and interupts my parents' busy schedules for pointless things (ex.complaining about me not giving the computer to him... After I Gave the Computer to him) so for the sanity of my family, please join and tell Ben that it is ok to talk, but to do it in an appropriate and controlled fashion. He would die in the ghetto</description>
