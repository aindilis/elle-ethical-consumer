  <description>Building people&#8217;s self-esteem and confidence is something in which friends, parents, and even teachers have interest in. Sadly not every child develops healthy self-confidence or strong self-esteem.
If you&#8217;re reading this, you may be thinking to yourself, &#8220;Yeah I wish I had more self-esteem and confidence.&#8221;  There are many people throughout the world who wish they were someone else, or fear their own physical appearance.  I believe this comes from lacking self-esteem and confidence.  If people had more self assurance of themselves, they wouldn&#8217;t be thinking negatively, or maybe they wouldn&#8217;t put themselves down about making decisions.  


1. Confidence in oneself or one's own abilities

2. self-esteem - a feeling of pride in yourself

3. self-assurance - freedom from doubt; belief in yourself and your abilities</description>
