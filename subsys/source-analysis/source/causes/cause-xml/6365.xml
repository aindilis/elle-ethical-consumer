  <description>This is it.  I need a Tim's in Vegas and I need your help.  We need to raise $1,000,000 to build a Tim Horton's franchise in Las Vegas.  All those who donate will see a return on their money when it opens and get a free coffee when they visit (one per visit cause we gotta make money to pay you back.)

Once built we will donate proceeds to "Operation Stop Hate" on an on going yearly basis to combat hate.  I will pledge 10% of all profits to this cause yearly.

PLEASE GO TO THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE TO MAKE A DONATION:

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT....
