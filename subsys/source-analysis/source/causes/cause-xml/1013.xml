  <description>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a very rare and incurable degenerative neurological disorder (brain disease) that is ultimately fatal.

CJD occurs worldwide at a rate of about 1 case per million population per year. 

As of December 2006, there is no cure for CJD, a fatal disease, and the search for viable treatments continues.

The first symptom of CJD is rapidly progressive dementia, leading to memory loss, personality changes and hallucinations. This is accompanied by physical problems such as speech impairment, jerky movements (myoclonus), balance and coordination dysfunction (ataxia), changes in gait, rigid posture, and seizures. The duration of the disease varies greatly, but sporadic (non-inherited) CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks (Johnson, 1998). In most patients, these symptoms are followed by involuntary movements and the appearance of a typical diagnostic electroencephalogram tracing.

1. CJD must be recognized as a threat.

2. CJD must not be covered up by the government.

3. CJD must be taken into consideration.</description>
