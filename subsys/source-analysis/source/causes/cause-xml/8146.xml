  <description>October 16th is World Food Day and NZ based organisation Global Volunteer Network is having a fantastic campaign called Eat So They Can on October 13th. It will take place all over the world and it simply involves hosting a dinner party, big or small, and collecting donations that will go towards the millions of children that go hungry everyday. It's a great idea and a wonderful opportunity to get behind a great cause. Please visit the website www.eatsotheycan.org and get involved! 

1. Every child should have the basic human right of having food to eat.

2. Children shouldn't have to starve, simply becuase of who they are, or where they live.</description>
