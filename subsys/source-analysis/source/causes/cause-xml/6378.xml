<cause>
  <description>This cause is made by the friends and people around Sheldon, for we are worried and to some extent "ashamed" of his behaviour, and we DO NOT want him to spread his emoness among his future friends-to-be and/or people he might meet in the future.
This MAY be harsh on Sheldon...but we must guide him to the right track of life, or else he will stray further and further away from it, to the point where no one...can change him.
----------------------------------------------------------------
WE CAN DO IT! IF ENOUGH PEOPLE JOIN...WE JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO CHANGE SHELDON AND MAKE OUR LIFE BETTER AND HAPPIER!!!

1. Sheldon's emoness must end immediately.

2. Sheldon shall not disturb/annoy any of us on msn and/or facebook</description>
