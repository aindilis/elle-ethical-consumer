  <description>Let's face it, all of our hard earned tax dollars are going towards the education and care of severly mentally retarded children.  and by Severely mentally retarded i mean the children that will spend the rest of their days in a wheelchair or a hospital bed wearing diapers 24/7, never bennefitting society.  just sitting there and waiting to rot as hospital nurses wait on them hand and foot.  this is not only a waste of tax payer money but it's also a very sad sight to behold.

this is a group that helps stop educational, health, and other kinds of aid to kids that would otherwise live out a meaningless existance.  These kids have nothing to live for so who are we to make them suffer anymore

1. have the option to put the severely retarded to sleep at birth

2. stop wasting hospital funds on braindead patients

3. stop the education of the severely mentally disabled</description>
