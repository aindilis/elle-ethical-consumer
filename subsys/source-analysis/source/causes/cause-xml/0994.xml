  <description>The DTRF funds research related to the diagnosis and treatment of desmoid tumors, facilitates and enhances the dialogue among members of the medical and scientific communities about research related to desmoid tumors, provides informational support for desmoid tumor patients and their families and friends, and heightens awareness of desmoid tumor diagnosis and treatment.

We are certain that our efforts to fund the most cutting-edge desmoid tumor research will result in the development of treatment options and will bring us closer to our ultimate goal -- a cure.

Desmoid tumors arise from connective tissue - the cells involved with the formation of muscle, fibrous and nerve tissue. Desmoid tumors, also called aggressive fibromatoses , are locally aggressive. This means that they can grow into and even destroy adjacent normal tissues, even bones. They do not, however, have the capacity to spread distantly (metastasize) throughout the body. Hence, most doctors consider desmoid tumors to be benign and not malignant. But regardless of the name, tumor-related destruction of vital structures and/or organs can be fatal.

1. Research must be done in the field of desmoid tumors.

2. Awareness of desmoid tumors must be increased in both the general and medical communities.</description>
