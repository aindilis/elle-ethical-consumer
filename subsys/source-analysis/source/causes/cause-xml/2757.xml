  <description>Ashoka envisions a world where Everyone is a Changemaker: a world that responds quickly and effectively to social challenges, and where each individual has the freedom, confidence and societal support to address any social problem and drive change. 


1. First, we support individual social entrepreneurs&#8212;financially and professionally&#8212;throughout their life cycle.

2. Second, we bring communities of social entrepreneurs together to help leverage their impact, scale their ideas, and capture and disseminate their best practices.

3. Finally, we help build the infrastructure and financial systems needed to support the growth of the citizen sector and facilitate the spread of social innovation globally.</description>
  <mission>To shape a global, entrepreneurial, competitive citizen sector: one that allows social entrepreneurs to thrive and enables the world&#8217;s citizens to think and act as changemakers.</mission>
