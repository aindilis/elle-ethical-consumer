  <description>Our school, G.I.A. has been plagued by rabbits shitting everywhere, rats running in the school kitchen, cockoroaches everywhere. 
Our school is respected from the outside, but if given a glimpse of the inside you'd be disgusted by the hair in the pizza, and the rabbit shit everywhere stinking up our school plus more.
The more members we get the more we get noticed.we have planned to get health inspectors but our fear is that they will be bribed. For all non-guyanese members, bribes are easy to make and way too often here.  Anyone with contacts to the minstry of health, contact me, alex powers. Pictures of the school and the unsanitary areas will be added in the next few days.
                              Thanks for your help.
