  <description>Hydrocephalus blocks the natural drainage of fluid from the head. As the fluid builds up, it puts pressure on the brain. The pressure at first affects a child's sight, then their motor functions, and finally their intellectual development.

1. Hydrocephalus is one of the most common &#8220;birth defects.&#8221;

2. It afflicts in excess of 10,000 babies each year in the US, and many times that in developing countries. More than 50% of hydrocephalus cases are congenital. 

3. As many as 75% of children with hydrocephalus will have some form of motor disability.</description>
