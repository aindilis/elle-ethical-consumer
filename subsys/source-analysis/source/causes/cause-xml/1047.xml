  <description>Project Diameter aims to connect people half-way across the world and half-way across social circles in order to promote social justice. We aim to bring hope to the hopeless through our talents and our work. We aim to educate and motivate. We aim to restore justice and free will to the shackled peoples of the world. 

Painters, musicians, actors, writers, sculptors, directors, conductors &#8211; artists, united, can return radiance to the face of humanity. We are the contrasting light in a dark world that batters the innocent and enslaves the defenseless.

1. Injustice mars the human experience.

2. Justice can successfully fight injustice.

3. Society is inertial &#8211; if an external agent does not exert force on society, then society will not change.

4. Artists are conduits of change, generating and proliferating ideas through various social channels.

5. Artists can exert a motion towards justice.

6. Artists can successfully fight injustice.</description>
