  <description>Put out awarness that there are Navy Veterans that are struggling from now what time on history that are trying to make a living and support their families no matter what they choose to do in life. There are veterans that are just simply ones like my own father that are trying to go after something that they had started earlier in life. This is for anyone who is a veteran or is a child of a veteran. Show your support those who fought for the freedom that we have today. 

1. Veterans need more federal assistance
