  <description>Liberty, freedom, civil rights are not gifts bestowed upon a select group of human beings (the West) by benevolent governments. These things are ours by nature of being human and are non-negotiable. We grant government the right to protect these things for us. It is our belief that all human beings, regardless of culture, race, sex, religion should be free to live their own lives in Democratic societies. Realisticaly we understand that movements for freedom rarely originate from within and to that ends are rarely successful from within that is why we, the members of this group, recognize the need for the application of military force in order to liberate the said oppressed people of the world. Talking, sanctions, and UN beuracracy do not yield adequate results... force does unfortunatley. 

1. All human beings should have legally protected civil rights.

2. All people should live in free democratic societies as this is the only way to ensure the above.

3. Diplomacy has its place, as does military force to really get things done.</description>
