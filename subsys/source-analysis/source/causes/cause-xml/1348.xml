  <description>Inspire Vietnam's mission is to improve the quality of education of Vietnamese children. We plan to achieve our mission by:

* Promoting literacy through the re-design or construction of school libraries
* Integrating technology to increase the quality of English language instruction

We not only plan to provide funding, but will also play an ongoing role to support schools.

We have finished our first library in My Tho, a small town 70km away from Ho Chi Minh City.  We are currently working on a second library for very needy students in District 9 of HCMC.  

Please support!  WHEN DONATING TO VIETHOPE PLEASE INDICATE THAT FUNDS SHOULD GO TO PROJECT INSPIRE VIETNAM. Thanks!
