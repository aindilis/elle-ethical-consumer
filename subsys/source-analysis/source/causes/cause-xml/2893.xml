DESCRIPTION
Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is an inherited metabolic disorder, that, if untreated, causes mental retardation, physical disabilities and death.  First described as a disease in 1954, it is a rare disorder, believed to be in all ethnic groups worldwide.  The national incidence is 1 in 225,000 births
 MSUD derives its name from the sweet, burnt sugar, or maple syrup smell of the urine.  The disorder affects the way the body metabolizes (processes) certain components of protein.  These components are the three branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine.  These amino acids accumulate in the blood causing a toxic effect that interferes with brain functions.

The MSUD Family Support Group is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with no paid staff.

Additional funds are needed for research in the fields of genetics, diet, related behaviors, on-going studies for improved treatment and MSUD related biochemistry.
