  <description>I am walking in the weekend to end breast cancer in September.  It's a 60km walk over the course of 2 days in Toronto. Help me raise money to fund the research that could save so many lives! Please go to endcancer.ca to sponsor a participant.   Under Sponsor a participant type Cheryl Tibbitts and then follow the instructions. You can donate online or print out a form to donate by mail or fax.   
Help me make a difference! 

1. Too many lives are lost needlessly! </description>
