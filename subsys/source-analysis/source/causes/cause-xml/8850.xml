  <description>Well, Everybody, not only me, are suffering of COMPUTERIZED EXAMS at UJ-"university of Jordan"

They get us confused enough not to pass, they are unfair to a high level, if we consider courses that need alot of studying and working, then to face an old computer getting you multiple questions, which m,ostly gets frozen and you lose what you've been doing, and then you have to start doing the exam all over again!

Why can't we just take the tests multiply on papers.
Since we have the ability- financially &amp; on staff sides as well.

We have old computers at UJ, older than the blocks that built that beloved holy place.

We need to be heard once!

Let's all stand up for our educational rights.
This could be the beginning of a new time, ALL that we are asking for is CHANGING THE methods we take tests in, no time waste, nothing AGAINST univeristy POLITICS and stuff!

All TOGETHER, Hand By HAND 

1. Computer-aided exams MUST go back on papers

2. Computers at UJ,MUST be RENEWED!

3. WE NEED FAIR TESTS at UJ,</description>
