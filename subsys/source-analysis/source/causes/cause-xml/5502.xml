  <description>The United States greatest enemy or at least fear right now is terrorism. However, our borders remain unprotected against the illegal immigration invasion. If we are truly concerned about terrorism then we need a strict border. Tom Tancredo understands this unlike several other candidates like John McCain, and the Democrats.

"In the first place, we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American
and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage
to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin. But this is predicated upon
the person's becoming in every facet an American, and nothing but an American...There can be no divided
allegiance here. Any man who says he is an American, but something else also, isn't an American at all. We
have room for but one flag, the American flag... We have room for but one language here, and that is the
English language... And we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the American people."
Theodore Roosevelt 1907
