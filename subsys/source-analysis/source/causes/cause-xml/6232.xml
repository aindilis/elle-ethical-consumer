  <description>As the world's largest terrestrial carnivore, the polar bear is the king of the great white north. It might come as a surprise then that this majestic species faces an uncertain future: Climate change is causing the disappearance of sea ice from which polar bears hunt their prey. Research funded by WWF found that with less time on the ice to hunt for food and store it leaves polar bears hungry and hinders reproduction. If current climate trends continue unabated, polar bears could become extinct by the end of this century. WWF is engaged on the ground and in the policy arena to address the causes of climate change and reduce its impact on wildlife and the world's wild places. Save the polar bears from drowning due to global warming melting the ice caps, and making the bears swim for thousands of miles!
