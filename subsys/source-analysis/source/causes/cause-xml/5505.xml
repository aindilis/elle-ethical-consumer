  <description>CASF campaigns endeavor to raise public awareness concerning human rights issues and invite public support to prosecute individuals, groups, or governments that have, or are committing crimes against humanity and nature.

The teams consist of students, academics and other professional as well as ordinary citizens who feel strongly about the human rights and environmental issues and campaign to bring the violators to justice.

If you are concerned about the future of life on Earth, humanity, your family, the environment, food, energy, health, education, culture, economy and governance, if you want to save the fabric of life on Earth, join in CASF campaigns.

Let us give life a chance. Perhaps we could save a segment of the future for some of the next generations instead of devouring the whole of the future.

CASF is affiliated with the Management School of Restorative Business (MSRB). For more information please visit: www.restorative-business.org
