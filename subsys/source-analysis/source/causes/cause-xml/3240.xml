  <description>This cause is designed to stop the pointless hate, violence and bias that accompanies every single religion.  It doesn't matter what religion one is; we are all PEOPLE, and we must all come together and realize that the killing, the hating, and the bias must stop for the greater good.  One must be honest with themselves and realize that no religion has ever been proven right or wrong, but that it is merely a belief system that people install faith into.  Stop it now, before it's too late.

*If there are donations (which I highly doubt, but who knows, someone out there might be kind of weird...) they will go to the Stop Genocide in Darfur non-profit.


1. Mindless hate based on religion must cease immediately.

2. The majority of wars the world has seen have been based on religion, and this must change what with advancements in horrifying military technology, such as nuclear bombs.

3. Religion does not matter.  All that matters is the common bond shared between us all; the bond of humanity.</description>
