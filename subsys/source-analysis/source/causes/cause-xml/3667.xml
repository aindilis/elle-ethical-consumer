  <description>Womaen&#8217;s Caucus holds the following commitments:

* To provide safe spaces for women to speak the truth about their life experiences and find support, affirmation, and an opportunity for collective action.

* To name the realities of sexism, economic inequalities, racism, domestic violence, health concerns, sexual abuse, and heterosexism as they affect the lives of women and children, and to call the church to accountability around these issues.

* To increase awareness of the dynamics of power and injustice which compromise the dignity of persons or whole groups.

* To connect with other individuals and groups engaged in the work of social transformation and develop local and national networks for those interested in feminist study and practice and its relation to faith.

* To bear witness to the strengths and courage of feminist women and men within the church.

* To advocate a position on abortion that is prayerfully respectful of women as moral decision makers.

* To claim women&#8217;s authority as theologians, and offer opportunities to reflect on scripture, tradition and spirituality in light of our life experience.
