  <description>Swaziland is suffering its worst drought in 30 years. There is simply not enough funding available to alleviate the crisis. Swazis, particularly the most vulnerable (orphans and elderly) need food now.

1. Africa is not a country; each country is unique, and must be treated as a separate entity with separate issues.

2. The AIDS orphans of Shewula Province, Swaziland, deserve long-term solutions to drought, famine and chronic living conditions.

3. Furthermore, these children are entitled to education, through which they can promote their own welfare, establish and protect their livelihoods, care for their families, and educate others about the scourge of AIDS.</description>
