  <description>By reducing farm subsidies we will hurt less then 3% of the population in Canada and help over 97% through decreased taxes and/or increased social services.  About 80% of farm subsidies in Canada actualy go to corporate farms rather than help the little guy.  We are willing to let the 20% that goes to the family farms remain in place despite the obvious arguments against this position.  But the 80% which lines the pockets of the shareholders of the Canadian farming industry must be stopped because it is just vote buying form of corporate welfare.  Other farm industry protection tactics include blocking cheaper food imports which translate into higher prices to the end consumer.  Also the Cartel known as the milk marketing board has just one purpose and that is to reduce production in order to increase the price of milk.  So next time you buy milk don't think "Thank a farmer," think you should "Save a dollar."

1. 80% of farm subsities in Canada go to corporate farms.  So most of the funds are not to bail out small farmers they are a form of corporate welfare!

2. Farm Subsities cause a dead weight loss to the economy 

3. Farm subsidies cost us all money through higher taxes.  And other forms of farm protection make our food cost us more.</description>
