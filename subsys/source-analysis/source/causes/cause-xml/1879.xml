  <description>The rainbow ribbon campaign is actually a combination of different ribbon campaigns. It fits almost every cause one can think of, and includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- Curing disease: AIDS, cancer, Alzheimer, Parkinson, Autism, Asthma, Diabetes ...
- An end to violence against men, women, and children.
- A prayer to end drinking and driving.
- An end to war and a hope for peace. 
- Treating others kindly.
- Being friends with others rather than enemies. 
- Ending child abuse/molestation. 
- Freedom of speech. 
- A world where skin color/religion/sexual orientation doesn't matter. 
- Each one of us can be happy. 
- Gender equality (no gender is better than the other).
- Think Green: Save our planet.

Suggestions are welcome!!!
