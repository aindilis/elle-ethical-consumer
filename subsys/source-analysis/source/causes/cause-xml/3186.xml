  <description>There is a huge lack of understanding in New Zealand society regarding our founding document, Te Tiriti o Waitangi - The Treaty of Waitangi.
Educating the New Zealand public about the document, and the various implications of the document since its signing, is a necessity for the good of society.
Once people gain a greater understanding of these issues,  scaremongering through the political system, should have less of an impact, and perhaps indigenous rights can finally be restored.

At first this was set up to simply add to my profile, but since so many people are obviously interested in this cause, we thought we might start adding more information and encouraging discussion.

*Please disregard the request for donations, as this cause was not created for that purpose.
