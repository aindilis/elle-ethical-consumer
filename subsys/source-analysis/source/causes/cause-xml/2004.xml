  <description>Globalization has been an active force in the world ever since the first explorers from the &#8220;Age of Discovery&#8221; set forth from mainland Europe. What Christopher Columbus and Vasco De Gama had attempted is not much different than what diplomats and businessmen attempt in this day and age. Both of these groups set out to find new markets to access with the help of the most innovative and recent of technologies in their contemporary time periods. In fact it can be easily argued that increased globalization since the 1700s has been one of the potent forces behind the rapid industrialization and advancements in human civilization. Globalization, thus, has been a largely positive force in the long run of world affairs and advancements. Its contributions to the global village have not been merely economic, but also ideological and technological.
