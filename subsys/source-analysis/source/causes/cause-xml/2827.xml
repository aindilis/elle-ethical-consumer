  <description>OnFire is the young justice movement within the United Methodist Church.  All money raised will go toward helping young people get to justice training events, action opportunites, and to start their own action events.  We recognize that God's call is different in different areas depending on the situation and the need, and we hope to enable grass roots groups to respond to their call as they hear it.  Thank you for your support!

1. God calls us to "...seek justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with God."

2. Christians are being misrepresented by a handful of ideologues

3. "No one is free until all of us are free!"</description>
