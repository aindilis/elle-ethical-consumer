  <description>A bike can change a life. Yet for millions of people on the lowest incomes, a new bicycle is financially out of reach.

Meanwhile, millions of perfectly good bicycles lay unused in North America, Europe and elsewhere in the Western world.

Bicycles for Humanity arose in September 2005 with the simple aim of enabling others to raise funds and collect unwanted bicycles to send to reliable partners in developing countries to provide affordable transport.

In developed countries, Bicycles for Humanity provides resources and support to make the process as simple and enjoyable as possible. In developing countries it works closely with other organisations to ensure that disadvantaged people are empowered through improved access to food and water, employment, healthcare, education and social opportunities.
