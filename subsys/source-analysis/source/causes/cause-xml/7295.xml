  <description>Objectives:
Using the resources in the community, we embarked on this project hoping to make a positive and lasting impact on the lives of the students at Sizamokuhle Primary School and Impala High School. Our project&#8217;s goals were to set up technology centers at the two schools, located in the KwaZulu Natal region of South Africa and  for our student volunteers to travel to South Africa to install the computers and teach the rural school teachers and students basic computer literacy.

The project was a huge success and will now be an ongoing project of the  Southern New Hampshire University Center for Service and Citizenship

1. That all schools deserve access to technology and computers
