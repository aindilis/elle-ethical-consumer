  <description>The clouded leopard is one of the most beautiful members of the feline family. This medium-sized cat is being slaughtered for its fur and by development/slash and burn agriculture throughout its home range. These cats are extremely difficult to breed in captivity, so its hard to even establish a captive population.

1. Poaching of Clouded Leopards MUST stop

2. The Clouded Leopard's land must be protected

3. More money should go towards a successful breeding program</description>
