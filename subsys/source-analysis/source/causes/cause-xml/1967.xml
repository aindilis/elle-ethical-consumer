  <description>In Ontario pitbull's are banned. But its not always the dogs fault! its the owner who makes them that way, to fight. Pitbulls is not the only breed as well to attack people. Hopefully by making this cause something can be done to stop this. Alot more cities and states are starting to think about this ban as well. Lets stop it before it gets really out of hand.


1. Pitbulls should not be banned

2. Ban The Deed Not The Breed

3. Why pay more attention to dog attacks, then actual human on human attacks.</description>
