  <description>We love sheep.  They are nice but sometimes you just have to throw one at someone like Andy Savage.  He is a student who attends Hilliard Davidson and sometimes (a lot) you just feel like you need to throw a sheep at him.  We believe in doing that and to continue doing that to help the lives of others.
