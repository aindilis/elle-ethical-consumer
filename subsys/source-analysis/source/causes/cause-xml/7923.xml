  <description> The webers mission - reaching out to the Thais through free English classes, Bible studies, and music ministry.

God is doing a great work in thailand, but it is a lost nation serving a God that cannot give them true peace or hope and leaves them serching.

This cause is for the webers. They need prayer and support in a place where the only light is there ministry. 

God is working through the church in kabin. the thai people want to know english, so they come and its free.
that way is the way they get in the door  and they present the gospel.

the majority of the thai population have not herd of the one true God. help be appart of that. consider going to Thailand. it is truly life changing.
