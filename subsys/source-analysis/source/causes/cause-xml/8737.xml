  <description>Rett Syndrome is a neurological disorder that almost exclusively affects girls. It is usually diagnosed when they are babies. Its symptoms are similar to those of cerebral palsy or autism. The severity of symptoms varies, however some common ones are: heart failure, seizures, problems with breathing, little or no communication skills, sometimes the loss of motor skills such as hand movement and the ability to crawl or walk.  Although we are learning more about the disorder, there are few treatments and obviously no cure. Some scientists are hopeful that a cure could be made available through cell research (as to this is a problem with mutated cells and brain function). It is rare, but a girl is born somewhere in the world with this devistating disorder once every five hours. Many believe that a cure is waiting to be discovered. 

1. The public is largely unaware of this disorder, yet it is becoming more and more prevelant.

2. Understanding the facts of Rett Syndrome can help us embrace diagnosed girls and their families.

3. Promoting research could cure this debilitating neurological disorder.</description>
