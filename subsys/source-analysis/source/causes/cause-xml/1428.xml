  <description>Don't worry this is all in good fun.  As many of you already kno Kristine is aka Krusty.....but did u kno the origin of that nick name?....well the only rash conclusion that I could come to was that it was because she has a crusty gi....so u change it up a bit and u get the nick name KRUSTY!

Don't ask her about this....she'll only deny it...like anyone else would.

1. The days of the crusty cover up for krusty must end.</description>
  <mission>spread to the world the horrors of the crusty gi that Krusty has.</mission>
