  <description>Domestic violence, also known as "battering" or "spouse/partner abuse", is defined as assaultive behavior between adults in an intimate relationship. 

This type of assaulting behavior can be inflicted by a current or former partner and be verbal/psychological, physical or sexual in nature which is intended to harm the physical or mental well-being of the victim.  Rarely is domestic violence an isolated incident; it is a pattern of coercive behavior intended to exert control and domination by the offender toward the victim. 

The recurring abusive incidents usually escalate in frequency and severity and can result in serious physical injury, disablement, or death, without outside intervention to protect the victim, stop the violence, and hold the perpetrator accountable.

Statistics:
&#8226;  Every 15 seconds a woman is beaten in the United States (FBI statistics)

&#8226;  Beatings are the single major cause of injury to women, more common than auto accidents, rapes, and muggings combined.

&#8226; Each year in the U.S. , 1,400 women die because of domestic violence.  Approximately 22 percent of college women have experienced physical violence in dating relationships. 

&#8226; 10-30% of women have been involved in abusive relationships.
