  <description>We are here to support our troops by donating to help those fighting for us across the seas. Whether or not you believe this war is right, our troops are putting their lives on the line and they need us to support them. Join this group and donate to "Soldiers' Angels". Send a care package to the troops. Show them you care and that they are loved.

1. Support the troops, even if you don't support the war

2. Spread your thanks to any and every soldier you see

3. Be Active! The Troops need our support! This is the least we can do</description>
