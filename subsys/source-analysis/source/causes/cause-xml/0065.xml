  <description>Last year, the House of Representatives passed a bill called the "Deleting Online Predators Act" (DOPA aka HR 5319).  The intention was to reduce the access of young people to websites where they could upload personal information and be potential prey of online predators.

Unfortunately, this ill-thought out legislation, banned the use of any website that acts as a social network (allows users to create profiles, upload personal information, and contact other users) from high schools and public libraries.  Since Web 2.0 is basically moving in the direction of allowing users to modify content, create profiles, and contact each other, this would ban a lot of great websites and many used for social and educational purposes.

Of course, this legislation was drawn up in a vacuum and did not include any young people in the development process.  Even the hearing before Congress did not include any young internet users.

Luckily, the legislation did not pass the Senate last year, but one Senator re-introduced the bill this year.  Please join the fight to Save Our Social Networks!

1. We should not ban the use of social networks from high schools and public libraries

2. Young people use social networks to communicate with their friends with positive social, civic, and educational purposes

3. Congress should not draft legislation that directly impacts millions of young people without even consulting members of our generation</description>
