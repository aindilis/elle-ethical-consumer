  <description>The United States is one, if not the most, powerful countries in the entire world. The US is considered to be rich, healthy, and thriving. Nevertheless, our national budget is almost 9 trillion dollars, there is people in cities and in the countryside that have no money, food, or shelter. I demand a change because this country can only be as strong as its weakest person. Our governmental officials make the rules that will benefit them and get them the most money possible while there are citizens that are suffering. This cause is created to change this nation to the powerful, wealthy, and thriving nation we claim to be. But first, we must start with our poor and hurting. 

1. Our country needs help.</description>
