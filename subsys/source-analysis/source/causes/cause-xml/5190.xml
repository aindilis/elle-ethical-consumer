  <description>The Lark Theater management announces that we closed escrow on the theater building on Thursday June 14 by getting a short term bridge loan. This means we own the building. However, in order to get an affordable mortgage , we need to raise additional funds of at least $70,000.

To donate or for additional information, call 924-5111, or email info@larktheater.net.

Checks can be mailed to: POB 685, Larkspur, CA 94977 or dropped off at the theater at 549 Magnolia Ave in historic downtown Larkspur.

Thank you to all the wonderful donors who want the theater to remain a significant cultural asset for Marin County.
