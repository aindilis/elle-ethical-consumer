  <description>Calvary Women's Services is a nonprofit organization in Washington, DC, that provides housing and support services to homeless women. Calvary's mission is two-fold: To provide homeless women with a place to live and basic services and to help educate and empower women for independent living. 

Though the women who come to Calvary face great challenges due to mental illness, addiction, domestic violence, or other issues, we believe that every woman has gifts and strengths that she can build on to be successful. We know that by keeping our programs small, we can meet each woman as an individual, support her as she works to achieve her goals, and empower her to take control of her own life.
