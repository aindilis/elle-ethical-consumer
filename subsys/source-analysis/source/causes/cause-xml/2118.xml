  <description>The Association of the Bar is located at 42 West 44th Street in Manhattan. The House of the Association is an elegant historic landmark building that was completed in 1896. With the modern technology and dynamic activities within its walls, the House and all it holds are emblematic of the Association's history, status and reputation in the legal profession: firmly rooted in sound traditions, but always pushing against perceived boundaries. Because of the strength and dedication of its members, the Association continually renews its spirit and that of the community it serves.
