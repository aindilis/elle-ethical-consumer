  <description>Mission:
Crossroads Springs exists as an orphan care center to provide support to children orphaned by HIV/AIDS through networking alliances with other stakeholders, and equip children with skills to enable them to grow into self-reliant, responsible adults.

Vision:
Our vision is to provide health, nutrition, careful handling, and good education to orphan children so that they become happy learners, develop skills to support themselves and help others; and become a source of economic and leadership strength for Kenya.  &#8220;Save the child, Heal the nation!&#8221; is the motto.
