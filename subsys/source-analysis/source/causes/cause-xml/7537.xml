  <description>Founded in 1984, Proyecto Aldea Global (PAG), is a Christian based, Honduran, non-profit development organization. PAG started in twelve villages in central Honduras running literacy, community health, child survival, and family based agricultural projects. As PAG grew, programs in housing, food security, community water systems, and cash crop diversification programs were also added. 

Over the past two decades the face of poverty has continued to evolve and change in Honduras...and PAG has evolved and changed with it. Our programs have grown out of the needs of the Hondurans we serve and now include programs in domestic violence, rural road construction (to bring crops to market), micro-enterprise, civil society strengthening, watershed and environmental protection and HIV/AIDs education programs.
