  <description>Every time a zoo keeper captures an animal, endangered or not, a child weeps to death. You're not only hurting mother nature's pets with enforced entrapment, you're also contributing to child genocide.

1. All zoo animals should be released into the immediate wilderness around them.

2. All of the animals in the Bronx Zoo would theoretically become cooperative members of society if we illegally released them.

3. Tigers only attack people if you say the magic word.

4. Gorilla babies and human babies would look exactly the same if you shaved the gorilla baby. Should human babies be raised in cages?</description>
