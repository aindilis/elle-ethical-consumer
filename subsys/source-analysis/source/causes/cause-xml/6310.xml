  <description>Each day more than three children die as a result of abuse or neglect in the home. On average, a child abuse report is made every ten seconds&#8212;a total of approximately three million child abuse reports annually. Childhelp has developed the following child abuse prevention guidelines to help keep your child&#8212;or a child you care for&#8212;from becoming a statistic.

To learn more about child abuse prevention, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-CHILD&#174; (1-800-422-4453). The 24-hour hotline is staffed with professional counselors who offer information about child abuse prevention as well as crisis intervention, literature, and referrals to thousands of emergency, social service and support resources.

i hope you learned something from this like i did. you may not have kids now, but if and when you do, this may come to good use.
