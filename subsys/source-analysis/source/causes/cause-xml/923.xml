  <description>Four hundred thousand numbers cover the dark surface of the Darfur Wall (darfurwall.org). Each represents a victim of genocide in Darfur, Sudan.  By donating $1 or more, you can turn one number from dark gray to brilliant white and honor one lost life.  One hundred percent of the proceeds benefit four organizations working for peace in Darfur.

1. We must stop the crisis in Darfur

2. We should fund both humanitarian organizations and groups that pursue political solutions

3. Raising awareness is as important as raising money</description>
