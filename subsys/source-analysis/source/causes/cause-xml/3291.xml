  <description>You think, &#8220;they want me to give money every single year from this day forward?  Heavens to Betsy, I barely make enough to buy the occasional piece of fruit to ward off scurvy!&#8221;  

Despite our almost universal praise of Galloway, we fail as a group when it comes to alumni support.  There are now over 1500 alumni of Galloway.  This year, 6% have contributed to Annual Giving.  We can and *must* do better.  

It is not important how much we give.  Any amount is welcome and cherished ($10, $25, $100).  What is important is that we give back.  

Your participation helps.  Larger grant making foundations look to see how much our community "cares" when making decisions about funding programs, facilities, and scholarships.  You can help make a difference just by sending in a donation appropriate to your current earnings.

Our Alumni Fund will go into effect for the 2008 Fiscal Year (which begins July 1, 2007).  At the end of the FY, the alumni association will have the opportunity to vote into which fund or project we want to designate the funds via the alumni website.

1. Students have the freedom to think, to grow, to question and to find their own truth.

2. Children learn best when they are drawn rather than pushed to learning, when they are comfortable, when they are respected and when they are challenged.</description>
