  <description>AISH CAMPUS LEADERSHIP

We are selecting a group of dynamic and highly motivated leaders to do the following on campus
&#8226;	Create social events 
&#8226;	Host Jewish Educational e.g. Lunch Learn with the Rabbi
&#8226;	To do Israel Activism 
&#8226;	Do market research on the needs of Jewish Campus Students
&#8226;	Brainstorm &amp; Implement ideas to service these needs


The leaders will be required to meet once a week.
There will be some training involved.
There will be certain money incentives e.g. for time and recruiting.
Leaders must be willing to put in a few hours a week.

VERY IMPORTANT!!!  SAUJS is an affiliate and a friend of Aish HaTorah. The Aish Campus Leadership is not trying to go into competition with SAUJS, on the contrary it is there to help. Therefore any event/programme will be done in conjunction with SAUJS (if they want).

In Short 
Aish is offering students the opportunity to reach out to Jewish Students in ways that will improve there lives on campus. This is a student run programme.
