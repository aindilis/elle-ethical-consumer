  <description>Obviously middle schoolers do not know where they are not welcome. They try so hard to be 'mature'. Too much. These kids have progressed from wearing high heels before they reached five feet to taking sexually suggestive pictures to post on myspace and finally, facebook. Now we all know that facebook is for college students. High schoolers have invaded, but we had the brains to know where we stand. And the reason we migrated here to facebook was in order to get away from those "if you don't pass this on you will die" and "who do you like? does he/she know?" bulletins. Now they have caught up with us, but we shouldn't need to run away again. They should know where they stand.

and this is NOT a hate group against kids in middle school. they're cool, but we need to have a place without them ya know?
