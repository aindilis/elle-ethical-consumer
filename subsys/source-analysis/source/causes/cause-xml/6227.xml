  <description>History
Durham resident Stephan A. Wainwright founded SeeSaw Studio in 1998 to address the lack of opportunities for career training in art, design and entrepreneurship for low-income youth and the chronically high teen drop-out rates in Durham.

 SeeSaw offers workshops during the school year and summer camps for youth ages 12-18.(300+ participants/year). 



1. We are committed to improving the representation of minorities in the fields of Art and Design.

2. We aim to serve as design and business mentors to youth in our program as well as to groups in our community.

3. SeeSaw Studio looks for creative, curious youth with enthusiasm and a willingness to work with and learn from a diverse group of people.

4.  In all endeavors, SeeSaw Designers are expected to show professionalism and resourcefulness.</description>
