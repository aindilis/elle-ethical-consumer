  <description>This is not just a local matter. 

Two days after Mayor John DeStefano of New Haven made New Haven the first city in the country to grant illegal immigrants a municipal ID, the federal authorities raided several homes and arrested 29 innocent immigrants. None of those arrested had any criminal record. Kica Matos, community services administrator for the city, says, "I think this is a disgrace and i'm ashamed of the federal government. These people were law-abiding working people and they were just taken away, and now we have broken families and traumatized people in this community."

We must STOP the federal government from continuing these "alien round-ups" in New Haven, and let them know they will NOT be tolerated here or anywhere else in the country.

1. The Federal Government has no right to arrest innocent civilians.

2. If the Feds continue to arrest/deport illegal immigrants from America, our economy will certainly be impacted.</description>
