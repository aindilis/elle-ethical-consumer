  <description>Most unicorns are known for having horns but some do not have horns. Many idiots confuse them with horses but if you take a genetic sample you will see the difference. Most people assume that they are stupid horses so these creatures are either wasted on farms or in glue factories. Before you buy a so called horse please test it's urine to ensure it is a horse and not an endangered and rare hornless unicorn. New!!!!!! Candians are slaughtering these beautiful creatures.</description>
