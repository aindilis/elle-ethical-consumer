  <description>Everyday, kids are left homeless or are kicked onto the street with no food and no where to stay. Our mission is to help those kids and get them food and a shelter so that they can still continue living somewhat of a normal life.

1. homelessness must stop.

2. Every one deserves a home.

3. Help live a normal life with food and shelter.</description>
