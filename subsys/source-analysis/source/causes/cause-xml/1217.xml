  <description>Mercy Corps helps people in the world's toughest places turn the crises of natural disaster, poverty and conflict into opportunities for progress. Driven by local needs and market conditions, our programs provide communities with the tools and support they need to transform their own lives. Our worldwide team of 3,700 professionals is helping millions of people in over 40 countries improve their lives. 

Since 1979, Mercy Corps has provided $1.7 billion in assistance to people in 107 nations. We take efficient stewardship very seriously: over the past five years, more than 89 percent of our resources have been allocated directly to programs that help people in needs. 

1. Our experience has shown us that turmoil and tragedy often create opportunities for lasting, positive change. 

2. We believe in the power of everyday people to organize for the change they want to see.

3. Such change requires that communities, government and businesses solve problems in a spirit of accountability and full participation. 

4. We are a team of problem solvers, finding entrepreneurial solutions tailored to the needs of each community we serve.

5. We believe that it is our duty to be effective stewards of the financial resources entrusted to us.</description>
