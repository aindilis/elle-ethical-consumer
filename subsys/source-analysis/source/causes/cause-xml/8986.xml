  <description>We educate children and families, at school and in the community, about the dangers of adolescent drug and alcohol use, prescription pill swapping, teen pregnancy, and other unhealthy behavior choices. We provide counseling programs for children exhibiting high risk behaviors and for families that have a parent in recovery. 

Our programs include:

Celebrating Families! - For families that have a parent in recovery.

HiRAP - A support group program for adolescents ages 13-17 who demonstrate high-risk behavior.

HIPP - Brief counseling for families struggling with addiction-related issues.

School-based Prevention Counseling Services teach schoolchildren to avoid high risk behaviors that can lead to addiction.

1. Prevent the development of drug and alcohol abuse.

2. Provide counseling for families in need of intervention.

3. Provide support groups for adolescents who demonstrate high-risk behavior. </description>
