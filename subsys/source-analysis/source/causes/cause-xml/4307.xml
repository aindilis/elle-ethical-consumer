  <description>Southeastern is a not-for-profit organization that has been providing guide dogs to the blind and visually impaired since 1982.  Located in Palmetto, Florida, they are the only guide dog school in the southeastern United States.

Southeastern Guide Dogs&#8217; mission is to offer, free of charge, a unique opportunity to achieve independent travel with safety and dignity to blind men and women, through the use of a professionally and humanely trained guide dog.  All services which include the trained dog, equipment, professional instruction and lifetime follow-up are provided, free of charge.

In addition, Southeastern will provide services to individuals with other disabilities and to law enforcement agencies through specialized training of our career-change dogs.

Southeastern receives no state, federal or local agency support. Our ability to provide guide dogs is due solely to the generosity of individuals, service organizations, foundations, bequests, corporate support and fundraisers. As a direct result of this generosity, Southeastern has placed more than 2000 guide dogs with the visually impaired since its inception. We currently have guide dog team graduates residing in 36 states and Canada.  Each guide dog team costs the school about $40,000.
