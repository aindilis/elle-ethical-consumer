  <description>"Andrea's Voice" was conceived by Tom and Doris Smeltzer, who lost their daughter Andrea to an eating disorder in 1999.  She was 19 and suffered from bulimia for just over a year when an electrolyte imbalance caused her heart to stop.  The two of them tour the country and give presentations on eating disorders, using their daughter's words as a central theme.    This powerful presentation describes the factors that contribute to the development of an eating disorder, the warning signs, as well as the necessary components of an effective treatment plan.  Doris authored a book entitled "Andrea's Voice: Silenced by Bulimia" (available at www.gurze.com) which shares her daughter's story.  Tom and Doris created the Andrea's Voice Foundation to raise money to help futher their mission.
