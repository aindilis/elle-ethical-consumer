  <description>Ok people freedom of speech means i can say whatever the hell i want whenever the hell i want to. Im tired of saying something then turn around an get in trouble for it, thats a complete load. The first amendment means that i can go up to every cop in the U.S. or hell even the president himself an say fuck you you stupid piece of shit, an they cant do one thing about it. Im also tired of goin to school and getting punished for something that i said that wasnt "proper." Its pretty much like the second i walk in school my first amendent is just gone, no its there with me every single day until the day i die, and until that day im going to use my right as much as i damn well please, an if you tell me to be quiet or dont ever say that, ill say to fucking bad. Get over it people its my right, an ill use it.

1. I can say what i want when i want.

2. If i say something an make somone mad, to bad.</description>
