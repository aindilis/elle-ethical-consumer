  <description>Coba is an impoverished village in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, which was once a thriving city in Pre-Columbian Maya civilization.  Today it's home to roughly 1,167 inhabitants (2005 Census) most of whom are Maya descendants.

The Coba Relief Fund was started by SUNY Geneseo Anthropology Department Chair Ellen Kintz in the mid 90's.  Primarily the Fund has provided food, clothes and agricultural resources in order to establish a stable economy and means of subsistence.

In late 2005 Coba was ripped apart by four Category 5 hurricanes including Katrina and Wilma.  The Coba Relief Fund raised over $3,000 dollars in 2006 that went to rebuilding homes and agriculture.

If you would like more information about the Coba Relief Fund, or would like to donate directly to the Fund, please email Dr. Ellen Kintz at: kintz@geneseo.edu
