  <description>A stealthy enemy has infiltrated our country and is preying upon the hearts and minds of 33 million American teens. Corporations, media conglomerates, and purveyors of popular culture have spent billions to seduce and enslave our youth. So far, the enemy is winning. But there is plenty we can do. We need to take action. We need to answer the Battle Cry.

1. Faith: We receive direction, provision, and motivation directly from the God and His Word to take the Gospel to the World.

2. Integrity: We are who we say we are; and we always do the right thing, regardless of expediency.

3. Relationships: We have servants' attitudes, and we go to heroic lengths to meet the needs of others.

4. Vision: We dare to dream as big as God dreams and believe that with God on our side, we can achieve the impossible.

5. Excellence: We demand of ourselves uncompromising quality and strive to be people who demonstrate excellence in everything we do.</description>
