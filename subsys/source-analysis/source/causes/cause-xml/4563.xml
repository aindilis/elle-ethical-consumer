  <description>Every Day in Los Cabos Dogs are abused and abandoned on the streets. They are starving to death , full of Ticks and fleas and mange. They are run over on the streets constantly. The Humane society has no federal funding and it relies solely on the goodness of your hearts and souls. Recently the San Jose Shelter has closed down leaving only the Cabo San Lucas humane society to deal with all of the animals in both towns! They are also trying desperatley to put in place an education program in the schools to teach children about caring for animals and having them neutered. Some dogs are kept in the hot sun on a rope barely long enough for them to lay down with no water or shade. Others scrounge through the garbage nightly to keep from starving. Some families have more than one dog and do not have the money to have the pets altered and so end up with unwanted puppies to deal with. Please help in any way you can to give these little guys the chance they deserve! We have a network in place as well to bring Dogs to Canada and the US if anyone would like to adopt one of them. 

1. Animals deserve a decent life

2. More shelters are needed here

3. The Shelter we do have needs donations to keep going

4. We need to educate people,Abuse and abandonment must stop

5. Neutering is necessary to stop the birth of thousands of unwanted puppies</description>
