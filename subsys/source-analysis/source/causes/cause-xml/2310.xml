  <description>Did you know that dog and cat fur products from Asian countries can legally be imported and sold in Canada?  

An estimated two million dogs and cats are killed every year in Asia solely for their fur.  Heartbreaking video footage of an investigation by the Humane Society of the United States in Thailand, China, and the Philippines reveals these gentle animals in unspeakable, horrific conditions.  They were found imprisoned in dirty, damp, cramped cages, sometimes beaten, stabbed, strangled or worse before being skinned.  Some were strays, and some still had collars on.  

Their fur is made into trim on jackets, hats, and gloves and trinkets like key chains and animal figurines and exported to other countries.  After finding it on the US marketplace, US Congress banned dog and cat fur in 2000.  The European Union is currently in the process of enacting a ban in all of its 27 countries.  Canada has taken no action to end its role in these animals' suffering.
