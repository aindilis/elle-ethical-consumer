  <description>SIAI is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institute in Palo Alto, California, with three long-term goals: furthering the nascent science of safe advanced AI (self-improving cognitive systems) through research and development, research fellowships, research grants, and science education; furthering the understanding of its implications to society through educational outreach, such as the annual Singularity Summit; and furthering education among students to foster an interdisciplinary field for the study of safe advanced AI.

1. Working toward the beneficial realization of the Singularity has unequaled leverage.

2. An interdisciplinary field for the study of self-improving systems needs to exist.

3. Friendly AI study needs to stop representing a critical, neglected area of research.

4. Most students are not aware of these issues or their importance. This should change.</description>
  <mission>In the coming decades, humanity will likely create a powerful AI. SIAI exists to confront this urgent challenge, both the opportunity and the risk.</mission>
