  <description>Description: On Thursday Ocotber 4th 2007, Metro Waste Paper Recovery &amp; myself will be participating in the Light the Night Walk to raise money for blood Cancer research.
The walk starts at 5:30 pm at Queen's Park and continues through the downtown core.
Our last stop on our walk will be Sick kids hospital.This stop brings forth tons of emotion as you see the children whom are hospitalized &amp; bedridden due to this horrible disease.
I ask that anyone interested in supporting this cause please come &amp; join us on the walk.
If you are unable to attend we are also accepting donations. Any amount helps.
Thanks for your support

Sincerely 
Shannon Dunai
