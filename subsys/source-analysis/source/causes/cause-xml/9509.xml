  <description>I've started this cause for people like myself who are surrounded constantly by the pressures of religious "friends" and family, as well as by the various churches and "outreach groups" to join an organized religion. These people/groups have a tendency to directly undermine or destroy the atheistic and agnostic beliefs of the people who possess them, as well as any beliefs (such as beliefs on abortion for one example) that an atheist or agnostic may possess.

1. Religion is Wrong

2. Religious pressure is CONSTANTLY exerted upon atheists and agnostics with religious friends and family

3. Possessing atheistic or agnostic beliefs does not  make a person immoral or wrong in any way</description>
