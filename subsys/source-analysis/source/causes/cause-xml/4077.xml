  <description>Have you ever had seen ugly piece of broken glass&#8230;When I look at one, it makes me think of when I was lost and broken. The beautiful part is Christ did not think it was too expensive to suffer death and buy me, a piece of broken glass. 


This August I will depart to Los Angeles, California, a place covered in people who are like broken glass. I will be at a ministry called the L.A. Dream Center in the middle of the inner city helping out with the restoration of people in anyway God can use me. The broken glass will shine&#8230;.



1. We as human beings have been separated from God

2. Jesus has come to restore us and eliminate that separation.

3. When people believe and proclaim that Jesus is Lord, Restoration comes.</description>
