  <description>ok so we all love the true colors conference.

but true colors is so much more than that.

they do mentoring and family services and the safe harbor project, amoung other things to support glbtq and intersex youth and their families.

plus, if you donate, you can help a youth attend the conference who can't ask their parents for money to go.

1. help support the youth in the community

2. help glbtq and intersex youth feel comfortable with who they are</description>
