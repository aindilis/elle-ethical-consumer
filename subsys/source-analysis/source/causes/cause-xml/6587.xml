  <description>Pema Ts'al: Pema Ts'al was founded as an educational institution for children, a place where students can study both the teachings of the Buddha and a comprehensive Western curriculum.

The first school, Pema Ts'al - Mundgod, India, is a highly regarded secular school for boys and girls up through high school. The 2nd school, Pema Ts'al - Pokhara, Nepal is a monastic Institute for boys.

Encouraged by the success of Venerable Lama Pema Wangdak's first two school projects, work has begun on a new instititue for Tibetan girls: Pema Ts'al Sakya Ani Institute.

What will be so special about this school is that it will combine both the most ancient and venerable of teachings with the most modern. Young girls will enter this program, and be provided with a profoundly strong education that will serve them in the world, whether as an 'Ani' (the female equivalent to a monk), or as a secular citizen.

Education will include everything from Buddhist studies, to web interactivity to languages, to science and research.

1. Tibetans have a right to access their culture.

2. A high quality education is essential.

3. Girls deserve the same opportunites as boys.</description>
