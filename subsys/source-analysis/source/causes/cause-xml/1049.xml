  <description>SENDLOVETOIRAN.ORG, the brain child of BriAnna Olson, looks to change the way Iran is presented in the media.  

This is a cultural mission involving traveling to Iran, recording their findings, and challenging the current media norm.  

And they need your help!
How can you help, you ask?

1. Spread the word! We don't doubt the power of the underground.

2. Join us! Interested in joining our mission? Drop us a line.

4. Put us in touch with your friends in Iran! We'd love to meet as many people as possible.

3. Help us get funding! We have a documentary budget with minimal crew. We're pretty punk rock, but we're not sure we can barter ourselves onto an airplane. Soon, we'll have art for sale and we have our hearts on our sleeves. If you know of any organization that might support our cause, help us find each other! 

More information about the project can be found at SENDLOVETOIRAN.ORG and myspace.com/sendlovetoiran


"As we march full steam into the future, I see a pressing need for independent media and public expressions of Love.  This experiential media project seeks to embody both of these things."

thanks!
