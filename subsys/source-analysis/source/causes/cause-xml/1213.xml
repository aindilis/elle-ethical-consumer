  <description>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation (ALSF) emerged from the front yard lemonade stand of cancer patient Alexandra &#8220;Alex&#8221; Scott (1996-2004). At the age of 4, Alex announced that she wanted to hold a lemonade stand to raise money to help find a cure for all children with cancer. Since Alex held that first stand, the Foundation bearing her name has evolved into a national fundraising movement, complete with thousands of volunteers across the country carrying on her legacy of hope. To date, Alex&#8217;s Lemonade Stand Foundation, a registered 501(c)3 charity, has raised more than $30 million towards fulfilling Alex&#8217;s dream of finding a cure, funding over 100 research projects nationally.

1. Raising awareness and funds for pediatric cancer research, primarily research into new cures and treatments.

2. Encouraging and educating others, especially children, to raise money for Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation for ALSF.

3. To fund both cutting-edge treatments for children fighting cancer, and projects aimed toward improving their quality of life. </description>
