  <description>This cause is for everyone out there who thinks that PETA is just a bunch of overactive and paranoid people who are blinded by their love for cute little doggies and kitty cats, thus hindering them from focusing on other, more important causes such as poverty, genocide, and human rights.

Joining and supporting this cause does not mean that you advocate animal cruelty, it simply means that you believe that there are more pressing issues in our world today.  As a matter of fact, I myself am a vegetarian.  But like others joining this cause, I believe that PETA needs to take a chill pill.  And I bet you that half the people who support PETA are not vegetarians.  

Hypocrites.  

So join this cause and tell those PETA peeps to shut it.

Take that PETA.

1. PETA overshadows many other important social campaigns - social campaigns that are essential for the betterment of HUMANITY.

2. First humans, then animals.</description>
