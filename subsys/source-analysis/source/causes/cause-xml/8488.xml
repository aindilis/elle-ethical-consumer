  <description>This amendment would propose to lengthen the sentencing range for torturing, mutilating or killing an animal a from it's previous statute. (sorry for the legal jargon) It is currently charged as a misdemeanor or a felony, with a maximum sentence of three years for such a serious and violent crime. Animal cruelty is horrifying, and a vile crime,with serious implications of sociopathic behavior. If legislation is amended, it would lengthen the sentencing range at a judge's discreation upon conviction of a felony. Please go to the website;

There is a direct link to the petition, and you can read all about the inspiration behind it. It won't take but a moment of your time, and it's SUCH a worthy,worthy cause. 

I ask any registered California voter to sign this petition, I have a senator who's willing to meet with me, and potentially sponsor a bill to amend the state law. THIS IS HUGE! Think of our pets, who are a part of so many of our families. Please, sign the petition, urge your friends and family to do the same. Every effort helps. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart, for it's a cause so dear to my heart.
