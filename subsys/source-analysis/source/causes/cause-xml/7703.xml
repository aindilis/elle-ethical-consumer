  <description>Our planet is in turmoil. There is war and descruction, and we could be on the verge of our demise, either slowly by the constant battering of pollution and global warming, or by atomic and nuclear means. This needs to stop. Now. Humans are no longer connected to one another, we do not have the sense of community and partnership that our ancestors once had. On Tuesday, July 17, 2007 at 11:11 Greenwich Mean Time (7:11 AM Central), people all around the world will join together in meditation and prayer in order to reconnect with all other people, and to help make a change for our planet. Please visit http://www.firethegrid.org for further information.
