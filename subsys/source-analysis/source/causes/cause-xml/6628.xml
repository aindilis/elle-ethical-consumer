  <description>hey guyz,
we students are so busy with studies during almost the entire year and then  waste our time during the holidays watching TV or partying till the break of dawn.

why not do some volunteering work here in dubai??

i know many of us want to do something for others during this summer but do not know where and how to start.

i will be keeping you updated with all the campaigns and programmes being held in dubai.

LETS HELP!!
