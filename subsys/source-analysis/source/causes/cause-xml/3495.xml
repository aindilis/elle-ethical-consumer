  <description>As a chapter of the nation's largest fraternity, the True Gentlemen of The Ohio State University want to give back to the community that has given us so much. Every dollar donated will go to fund a community service event sponsored, planned, and executed by SAE Ohio Theta. Past events include: participation in Rock the Block, a campus wide food drive, and continued involvement at Indianola Elementary School in Columbus, OH.

1. Promote the True Gentleman at every oppourtunity.</description>
