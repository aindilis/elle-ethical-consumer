  <description>STR teaches the value of using our minds to love God and share the Gospel. We teach careful reasoning and well thought-out answers so that Christians will participate in public discussion (at home, at work, or at the university) so that the Christian world view has a place in the debate. We encourage Christians to develop coherent answers to questions that challenge Christianity so that their faith is deepened and thereby are emboldened to share the Gospel.

1. All human beings are made in the image of God and are therefore valuable ends in themselves, not just instrumental means to other ends that are valuable.

2. Orthodoxy--This is our content base. We stand in the mainstream of historic Christianity.

3. Cultural Relevancy and Tactical Soundness

4. Accuracy, Clarity, and Even-handedness</description>
  <mission>Train Christians to think more clearly about their faith and to make an even-handed, incisive, yet gracious defense for classical Christianity and classical Christian values in the public square.</mission>
