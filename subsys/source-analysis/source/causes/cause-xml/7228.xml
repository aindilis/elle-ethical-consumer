  <description>Epilepsy is a debilitating condition, one that most people dont know much about. This can create problems for people who have it. The purpose of this cause is to spread awareness of epilepsy, and to dispel myths about the condition. Also, we hope to raise money for Epileptic support. Most epilepsy medications cost more than 200 dollars a month, and it is difficult to obtain insurance.
