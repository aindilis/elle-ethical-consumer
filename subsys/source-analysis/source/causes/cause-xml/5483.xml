1. Climate policy must be scientifically based and reach 80% reductions by 2050.

2. Fossil fuels  subsidies and investments must be shifted to renewables now. 

3. We must ensure a just transition that improves and supports their physical, social and economic health of all people.

4. We must prioritize major reductions in total energy use through conservation and energy efficiency.

5. Energy policy should be made by people and for people, not by energy companies for energy companies.</description>
