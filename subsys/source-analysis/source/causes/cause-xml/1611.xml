  <description>Hey, and if we destroy Earth.... who can blame us? All we wanted was for us, and cute polar bears, not to freeze our asses off. And if you object, you can't say shit unless you live in the North Pole....Or Syracuse.

     Also, if we ruin Earth, then it will open us up to exploring the rest of the universe! Man, it will be like the sci-fi channel. Lasers.

1. Pee in the Ocean as much as possible. Pee is warm, and makes the ocean warm.

2. Give penguins and bears blankets.

3. Get your tan on.</description>
