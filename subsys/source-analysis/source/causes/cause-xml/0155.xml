  <description>Young people pay taxes and can be charged as adults for crimes, yet they cannot vote.  This is taxation without representation and contrary to the basic principles of our nation.  

Young people understand politics just as well as adults do, there is no reason to deny them their right to vote.   Plus studies show if you get people in the habit of voting age at an earlier age they are more likely to continue voting throughout life.  Lowering the voting age will boost voter turnout.
