  <description>For this is The New Gospel: 
There IS no Master Race. 
There IS no Greatest Nation. 
There IS no One True Religion. 
There IS no Inherently Perfect Philosophy. 
There IS no Always Right Political Party, 
Morally Supreme Economic System, 
or One and Only Way to Heaven.
 
Erase these ideas from your memory. 
Eliminate them from your experience. 
Eradicate them from your culture. 
For these are thoughts of division and separation, 
and you have killed each other over these thoughts. 

Only the truth I give you here will save you: 
WE ARE ALL ONE. 


1. Transformed connection with God and with ourselves

2. Peace and global sustainability will materialize through the shared knowledge, resources and actions of all individuals.

3. Demonstrating and living the principles of Conversations with God

4. Life is God, made physical, and growth and evolution are the hallmarks of God&#8217;s process&#8230;or the process of Life Itself. 

5. Recreate ourselves anew in the next grandest version of the greatest vision ever we held about Who We Are. </description>
