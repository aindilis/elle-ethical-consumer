  <description>i, and a few others believe that the sock was created by "Big Brother" to oppress the common man, say you want to go out some where you need shoes ahw but theres the catch to wear shoes you need socks. we will save so much time and stress if we rid our selves of the sock menace. and what happens when you wear socks? your feet sweat more then your shoes smell then well you get the point

1. stop the foot oppression

2. let our toes roam free

3. git some frickin sandals</description>
