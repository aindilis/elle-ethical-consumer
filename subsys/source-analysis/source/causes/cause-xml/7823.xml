  <description>www.propertyfriends.co.uk is a website dedicated to the growing trend in property co-buying brought about by escalating property prices in the UK, which make it hard for first-time buyers (FTB) to take their first step on to the property ladder. 

The site provides clear and easy to understand information on all aspects of co-buying. Members can post their own profile or search other members&#8217; profiles to find a &#8216;Propertyfriend&#8217; match. They can learn more about potential co-buyers via the website&#8217;s secure email service, and use the &#8216;Ch@t&#8217; member-to-member instant messaging service to identify like-minded people on the database who might want to participate in a purchase. Another popular feature of Propertyfriends.co.uk is blogging, where members can post and read blogs about real-life co-buying experiences. 

Propertyfriends.co.uk also contains a wealth of information about legal matters, finance, insurance, property news and property options. Furthermore, Propertyfriends.co.uk hosts speed networking events, allowing members to meet face-to-face in a safe and secure environment.
