  <description>Retinoblastoma is an eye cancer of early childhood.It is a tumor that occurs in the retina, the light - sensitive lining of the eye. The most common symptom is an abnormal appearance of a pupil, which tends to reflect light as a white reflex, like a cat's eye. This is usually only visible to the naked eye in low artificial lighting, or in photographs where a flash has been used.
This cancer only affects children under 5 years old.
It is very rare, only 50 children will be diagnosed with retinoblastoma in the UK each year.
Over 95% of children will survive after treatment.
So if anyone takes a picture of anyone under 5 and their pupil looks whie in the photo, please take them to your GP ASAP to get them checked out!
