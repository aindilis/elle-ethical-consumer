  <description>STRAY dogs are being skewered on hooks and dragged behind boats as live shark bait. The cruel practice takes place on French-controlled Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. A six-month-old labrador pup was recently found ALIVE with a huge double hook through its snout, and another through a leg. The pup was found in a coastal creek and is thought to have somehow freed itself from a fishing line, but other dogs and kittens have been chomped up and swallowed by sharks.

When you donate, all your money will go to help find homes for animals so those heartless people dont have any stray animals to use.

1. Animals being used as shark bait must end immediately</description>
