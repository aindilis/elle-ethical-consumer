Nearly 4,800 cyclists from 36 U.S. states and six countries will ride up to 192 miles across the Commonwealth in the 28th annual Pan-Massachusetts Challenge (PMC) on Aug. 4 and 5, 2007. Their collective goal is to raise $27 million for cancer research and treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute through its Jimmy Fund. To date, the PMC has raised more than $171 million.

Presented by the Boston Red Sox and Overstock.com, the PMC is the nation's first fundraising bike-a-thon and today raises more money than any other athletic fundraising event in the country. The PMC is so well respected in cycling and fundraising circles that each year people travel from all over the world to participate.

Cyclists choose from nine routes of varying mileage designed to cater to all levels of cycling strength and time availability. The camaraderie shared by cyclists, volunteers, and supporters is among the PMC' greatest attributes. Doctors at Dana-Farber join their patients as teammates, riding for a unified goal. More than 300 PMC cyclists and volunteers are cancer survivors. Thousands of riders have lost loved ones to the disease. Still more ride in honor of those in treatment.



IF INTERESTED IN DONATING:
Either do it through the link here, or you can give me the money, and I'll give it to my dad, who is a 12th year rider. His goal is to raise $10,000.
