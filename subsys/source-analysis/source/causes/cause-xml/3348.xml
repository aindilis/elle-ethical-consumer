  <description>The original 'Green Revolution' was a success... the middle class got richer and poorer farmers got poorer. There was a flood of these poor farmers moving into the cities from the country side in India. Yet, only the success were ever looked at to determine how revolutionary the Green Revolution was.

So, now it is happening again but it is being concentrated on Africa. When you read about it, it sounds great but read between the lines.
1) Monsanto is involved, they own most Genetically Modified seed patents and they have a horrible history of inhumane activities.
2) With GM Seeds you HAVE to buy the special fertilizer and a few years after using them you now have super weeds which need super pesticides.

We all know where this leads.

This is Business in the guise of Charity. Monsanto is forcing future customers and future environmental devastation through this 'charity'.

ALSO: 850 African Farming Organizations are against the 'The New Green Revolution', that should speak louder than anything I can say.

NOTE:
I am not trying to raise money, just awareness.

Though, I researched Mercy Corps and they are really good. I would go through them to donate though not this application. I just don't agree with middle men no matter thier intent.

1. End Business in the guise of Charities

2. Stop enforcing the help that is not wanted

3. People know what they need, lets stop telling them what they need</description>
