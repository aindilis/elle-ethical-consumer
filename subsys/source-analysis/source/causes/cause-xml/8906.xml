  <description>My name is Fadi, I'm 15 years old. A boy living in Wehdat Ghetto. Dad is sick, he cannot move to work and mom is a dressmaker. We are 10 at home and I'm the older boy. Mom is an old women and I decided to work to feed my family by selling some stuff in the street. One day my life completly changed. I was seven years old when my parents were out and my little brother was playing soccer outside then the gas blew up on me and changed me forever. Thanks God I was the only victim. 
Money helps to live, eating helps to forget but people's eyes never lie! Pity kills. 
I want to be like my friends without pity, I want to be a real man one day without feeling strange, I want to find a real job one day without being treated bad or by disgust, I want to have back myself confidence without sadness, I want to be loved without feeling ugly, I want to get married and have kids without losing hope, I want to shine again! 
Two years, I met Faten, she took me at the hospital but the doctor didn't give us hope. But in January, she took me to another doctor and the report can explain you my situation. We need help from you, not neccesary money but if you know someone that can help me, please contact me. 
Your help is my only hope to be a cute boy again. 
I need you to be strong, to be in this world again, to feel real love and not pity,  I don't want to keep my light in a dark face again! Fire stole my smile but I'm fighting to be back again. 
Please contact me if you can do anything to me. 
Thank you
