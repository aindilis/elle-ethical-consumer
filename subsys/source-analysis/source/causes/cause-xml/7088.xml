  <description>We believe that Canada's activities in Afghanistan are unethical and should be ceased immediately. We believe that this is the best way we can "support our troops" but more importantly we believe that this is the best way to support the Afghans.  

1. Canadian troops should be pulled from Afghanistan.

2. Afghans should have independance from outside interference.

3. Military force is only appropriate in defence.</description>
