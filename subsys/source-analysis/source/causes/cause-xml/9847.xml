  <description>Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive disorder of the brain that leads to uncontrolled movements, emotional instability, and loss of intellectual faculties. 
HD results from degeneration of brain cells. Specifically affected early in the disease are cells of the basal ganglia, a structure deep in the center of the brain where movement is coordinated. Later, cells of the brain's outer surface - or cortex, which control the functions of thought, perception, and memory - are attacked. 

Today, HD directly affects a total of about 25,000 people in the U.S., and at least 100,000 of their blood relatives live with constant uncertainty as they look for signs indicating that they, too, may have inherited the gene that will cause progressive disability and eventual death.
