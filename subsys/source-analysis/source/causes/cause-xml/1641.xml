  <description>This is to raise awareness of the injustice that would be thrusted upon society if Lastings Milledge left the Metropolitans of New York.  His uncomparable athletic ability boosts attendance, sales, and total revenues which directly flow into the local economy, creating more jobs and lowering unemployment.  The increasing promise of Carlos Gomez is making Lastings more expendable.  If Lastings goes, so does the soul of the greatest city in the world.  

Will another hardworking african american lose his job to a younger, more hispanic guy?  Let Omar know there's room for both.   

All proceeds will benefit Gay Men of African Descent, because they will be hurt the most if they couldn't oogle Lastings anymore.  

1. To save New York City, NY, USA

2. To emphasize African American/Latino integration in the work force

3. Reparations for the gay brothers</description>
