  <description>This is a passage I've taken from the Millenium Promise homepage...

"More than one billion people worldwide struggle to survive on less than $1 a day. By empowering the poorest of the poor, Millennium Villages are demonstrating that it's possible to escape this cycle of extreme poverty, hunger and disease throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Together we have the knowledge, the wealth, and the will to end extreme poverty, but we need your help. "
