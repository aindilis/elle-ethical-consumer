  <description>The Global Youth Partnership for Africa (GYPA) is currently seeking $20,000 to support vocational education for two inspirational and internationally acclaimed soccer teams in Uganda.  These teams are part of a GYPA program that educates their members -- and particularly girls -- about HIV/AIDS, gender equity, and conflict resolution.   

Unfortunately, these soccer teams are at a standstill, and require funds for their buses, which they use to attend international games and spread hope, and which they also require to make ends meet as a special-hire taxi service in Kampala, Uganda. In serving as a taxi service, they will need vocational education in automechanics.

Our mission is to raise at least $5,000, if not the full $20,000, so that they can afford training in automechanics and provide for themselves, continue to receive an empowering education, and serve as emissaries of hope in their travels.

Please donate and help us BUY THIS BUS! We really need help raising $5,000, and even $5 goes a long way in Ugandan shillings. Your support would be greatly appreciated!


1. Support the young players of the Gomo Tong FC and Girls Kick It! programs.

2. Finance their vocational education in automechanics so that they can provide for themselves.

3. Enable their continuing education about HIV/AIDS, gender equity, and conflict resolution.</description>
