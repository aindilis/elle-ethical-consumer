  <description>First and second trimester abortions should remain legal.

1. Every woman deserves the right and ability to obtain a safe, legal abortion.

2. No woman should be forced into having an abortion.

3. Contraception should be widely available and easy to obtain.

4. Thorough comprehensive sex education should be included in all elementary, middle and high school curriculums.

5. Abortions reduce the number of unwanted and abandonded children.

6. Keeping abortions legal means keeping abortions safe.</description>
