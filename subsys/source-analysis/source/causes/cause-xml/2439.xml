  <description>We recently started a facebook group, called Where are USI's Traditions and Parties, with intentions of enhanceing the traditions and parties held on campus at USI. Hopefully to stop people from going home and to start making people party out on campus on the weekends.  We have several ideas for some HUGE events that we hope can become USI tradition.  The catch...money. It's going to cost to start this and we also have several ideas to get this ball rolling.  WE INSURE YOU THAT ALL THE MONEY WILL FUND EVENTS HELD ON USI'S CAMPUS...FOR USI STUDENTS. THAT'S YOU. 

1. To create tradition and pride at USI.

2. To make students at USI feel they had a part in USI's history.

3. To entertain the students of USI for a cheap price, and at USI!</description>
