  <description>In the summer of '06, a very important women to me was diagnosed with colon cancer - my mother. The cancer was successfully removed through surgery, and she decided to go through chemotherapy just as a precaution. As a post chemotherapy procedure she went in to take a CT scan to be sure the cancer was gone. She was almost certain that they would not find anything. However, we received the shocking news that the cancer had spread to her liver. 

This is what began my research into alternative medicine. It is disturbing what I have found out about western medicine. 

Did you know that pharmaceutical companies may not release a medicine unless it has a lethal dose?

Even if there is a natural remedy which cannot be lethal, the components must be altered in order to make it lethal.

Does it make sense to treat cancer with chemicals and toxins that break down the body or to boost the immune system?

My mother has refused another chemotherapy treatment, has seen a homeopathic doctor, and the cancer is retreating. If she would have done chemotherapy again her chance of survival would have been about 5%

Natural solutions are not only for treating cancer. Whenever you are diagnosed with a health problem I encourage you to look into the natural solution before taking medication that could kill you.

It is your choice what you do but if you believe in eastern medicine please help spread the word. It could save lives!
