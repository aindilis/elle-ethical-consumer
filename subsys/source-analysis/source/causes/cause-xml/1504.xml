  <description>Colon cancer is a type of cancer that is affecting more people across the world today than it ever has before. Like other cancers, if untreated, people with colon cancer don't have much chance of living. With proper treatment, people can survive but a lot are forced to have colostomy bags for the rest of their lives. It can be treated if caught early enough but colonoscopies aren't exactly the most fun things in the world to have done. We need to get out there, spread the word &amp; raise money to find a cure!

1. People need to be more aware of colon cancer!</description>
