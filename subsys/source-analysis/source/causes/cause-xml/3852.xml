  <description>Slow drivers cause accidents, frustration, heart attacks, stomach ulcers and maybe AIDS. It is time to take them off the street or at least put them in the right lane where they belong.

1. 'we believe the left lane is misunderstood

2. We believe in allowing good drivers to walk up to poor drivers and remove there keys at stop lights

3. Fast drivers are superior people and slow drivers are simply our pawns</description>
