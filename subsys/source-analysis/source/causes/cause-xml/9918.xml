  <description>Rather Lather Hygiene Clean (RLHC) is an organization that gives toiletries to those who are not able to afford them or have resources too minimal to obtain them.  It was created in response to the founder's Bat Mitzvah torah portion that focused on the purity of humankind and the biblical laws that coincide with it. RLHC is now working with the Satell Teen Fellowship for Leadership and Social Activism to increase donations and support, as well as work with other community service projects to create a workable community amongst them. To donate, either make a personal donation with toiletries or email Melanie Rivkin at mellykin@hotmail.com to make a donation through cash. Whether it be picking up little shampoos from your hotel during vacation or finding stuff you don't use in your house (shampoo, makeup, rubbing alcohol, anything for hygiene!), you can help! Please email Melanie at mellykin@hotmail.com or go to our website www.geocities.com/rlhc2002/RLHC for information on how to donate! Thanks so much!
