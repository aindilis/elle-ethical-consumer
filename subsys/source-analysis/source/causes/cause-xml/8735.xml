  <description>This is a Jewish community I visited in the Summer of 2007. They are located in Sefwi Wiawso Ghana. They have many needs, but the one that stands out is their need and desire for a Rabbi. They would prefer that one of their own, their current leader could be trained as a Rabbi.
Some of their other needs include solar power boxes, computers and teaching aids for teaching Hebrew School.
