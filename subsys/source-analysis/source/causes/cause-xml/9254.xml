  <description>Malaria is the most common cause of death among children under 5.  Worldwide malaria causes 300-500 million infections a year and the number of people suffering from the disease has increased.  Poor regions, particularily Africa, are hardest hit, 90% of child deaths from malaria occur in Africa.  
The disease weakens and permanently impairs far more than it kills, restraining growth and slowing economies.  Prevention is key and an insecticide treated bednet makes prevention possible.
