  <description>Here in MA, SPED students are fully integrated into the school system. Yet, in other schools across the country the SPED students are kept far away from the "Normal"    crowd. And, in other countries like South Korea, children with disabilities aren't even given an education.  

1. All SPED Children should be fully integrated into the school system if the parents so desire.

2. Classes should be taught to teachers on how to teach SPED students in the "normal" classroom.</description>
