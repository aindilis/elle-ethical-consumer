  <description>The Foundation was founded on July 26, 1998 by Lambda Theta Phi Fraternity brothers who delivered the message of unity, pride of heritage and value of education to the next generation through scholarships to deserving Latino high school students.
 
Since its founding, the Foundation has awarded numerous scholarships to male and female students from diverse cultural backgrounds who demonstrated high academic performance, leadership skills and financial need.
 
To further develop and enhance leadership qualities, the Foundation is now offering training seminars &#8211; Methods and Messaging: Community Action Strategies Training &#8211; throughout the fraternal network.
