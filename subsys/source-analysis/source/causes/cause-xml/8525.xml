  <description>Del, along with the other members of Hieroglyphics, is a beacon shining in the light amongst the world of mediocre, excessively vulgar, plebian "gangsta" rap.  If at all possible, it is ideal that we expose everyone to the wonders of this juggernaut in the underground hip-hop world.  Then, just maybe, world peace and starving african babies, and country-less jews can find themselves in the promised land.

1. Del is a wizard of words.

2. Phoney Phranchises are bad.

3. This is The Scandle.

4. We wish our brother george was here.</description>
