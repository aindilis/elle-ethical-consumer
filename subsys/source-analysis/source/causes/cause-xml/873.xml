  <description>With the growing conglomeration of the radio and music industries, independent artists and radio stations are finding it increasingly difficult to survive.

So support unique national programming like A Prairie Home Companion, All Things Considered, Car Talk, This American Life, etc., as well as local news and programs, classical music, and one of the last venues to discover great new music, The Current (Twin Cities - 89.3 FM).

You don't even have to be a resident of the fine state of Minnesota to benefit from giving a buck or twenty to MPR. Just point your browser to http://minnesota.publicradio.org/, and listen from the comfort of your favorite media player.

Join now, and enjoy!
