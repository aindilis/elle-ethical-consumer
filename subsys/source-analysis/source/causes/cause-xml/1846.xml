  <description>REALIZE; there is constant globalization which seamlessly modifies and molds your daily routine.  

   There are more wars on terror than the U.S.A. contra extrimist Islam fundamentalists.  In the search for justice and global democracy based in equality and fairness to all, people in power deem it simple and don't think twice in destroying anything that seems unimportant to accomplish their ego-driven goals.  

   In the mid 1900's the U.S.A. debilitated a prospering 3rd world country; forced it's  economically, politically, and socially stable base of a nation to deteriorate and crumble by taking over with military force Palestine.  In it's process they established Isreal a country which the global community deemed not fit to be called an independent member in the global community.

   First 55% was taken away, then another 23% of land in the 1984 war by Isreal contra Palestine.  The once care free nation is riden with corruption, war crimes, occupation, death, rape, and unjustified imperialism (never the less, imperialism can never be justified).

   This is the beginning in the long war against Palistinian occupation unless entire nations understand the problem and speak out...

   Be part of the revolutionary movement that is real freedom, real justice, real liberty, real democracy, real right to live and die happy.
