  <description>Autism is a lifelong disability that is diagnosed in children as early as 18 months. Currently, there is no cause and no cure. Because of this, we need your help. We need to aid in the development of these children and help find a cause/cure through donations, even if all we could give is the opportunity to raise awareness.

1. Autism Research must take place in order to find a cause and a cure for autism.

2. We need to find any way possible to raise awareness about autism.

3. To change the lives of children living with an Autism Spectrum Disorder.</description>
  <mission>To raise awareness of the many children who are diagnosed with autism each year (which is about 1 child in every 160 births) and to get as many donations as possible in order to find a cure.</mission>
