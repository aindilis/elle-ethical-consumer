Throughout the world, Operation Smile volunteers repair childhood facial deformities while building public and private partnerships that advocate for sustainable healthcare systems for children and families. Together, we create smiles, change lives, heal humanity.

For $240 Operation Smile can change a child's life by giving the gift of a surgery. Revenue in excess of surgical costs are invested into our sustainability programs, empowering our partner countries to treat more children on their own and making your investment go even farther. The complete Operation Smile model is an investment of $750 per child.

Since 1982, more than 100,000 children and young adults have been treated by thousands of volunteers worldwide and thousands of healthcare professionals have been trained globally.

The World Care Program (through Operation Smile) brings children and young adults, through sponsorships, to the United States for surgeries that are too complicated to be performed during in-country missions. Since 1985, more than 150 World Care patients have received life-changing surgery.
