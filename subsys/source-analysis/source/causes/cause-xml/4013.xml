  <description>Ever feel like you want to DO something? Well, it's summer! Find some hot girls, some bikinis, some soap, water, and a parking lot, and join people all across America taking part in a new trend: Car Wash For Peace. Inspired by the song "Car Wash For Peace" by former SNL-alum and comedian/acotr Jimmy Fallon (song available exclusively on iTunes and www.myspace.com/jimmyfallon), the premise of the car wash is simple. Do what YOU can to spread the message of peace, and throw a Car Wash in your community! Put down your guns, pick up a sponge! Make suds, not war! All proceeds of planned car washes, as well as sales of the original song on iTunes benefit FisherHouse.org, which provides military families with housing while their brave family members heal from war-inflicted wounds. Find out how you can help by going to www.myspace.com/jimmyfallon!

1. Healing soldiers: how can you say no!

2. Activism!

3. If we all work together, there will be no more wars...or dirty cars.</description>
