  <description>Hillel@FSU is here to provide any and all Jewish Tallahassee college students the opportunity and tools to do Jewish with other Jews. Whether this means a Shabbat service at Hillel, a Shabbat dinner in your own home, a spot to crash between classes, or attending a speaking event by a Jewish celebrity, Hillel is here for one thing. You.

1. We will provide our students with valuable leadership opportunities and teach them Jewish life skills.

2. We will build positive relations in the community by teaching the importance of community through Tikkun Olam.

3. We will open our doors and welcome students from different traditions, practices, and backgrounds with warmth and concern.

4. We assert that the connection to the land and the people of Israel is an essential element of our students' Jewish identity.

5. We will hold ourselves accountable for the responsibilities invested in us.

6. We will strive to maximize opportuities for FSU students to travel their individual and collective paths of Jewish education and spirituality.</description>
