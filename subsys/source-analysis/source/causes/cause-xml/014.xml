  <description>The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center was founded in 1962 as a facility for cutting-edge physics experimentation.  It has been responsible for numerous scientific breakthroughs and Nobel prizes, and is also home to the longest building in the world.

The Stanford Labor Action Coalition was founded in 1998 "to ensure that Stanford fulfills the ethical responsibilities laid out in the University charter."  They have been responsible for numerous annoying and ultimately ineffectual activities around campus.

The latter presents a confusing acronym to the Stanford community, and either failed to do adequate research (ie, pay any attention to anything) before deciding, or willfully stepped on the toes of a useful, noble institution.
