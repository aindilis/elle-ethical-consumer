Blackle is Google's Black Version.
you know on Google, there's that reallyreally white background
well.
it wastes a hell of a lot of energy.
so Google decided to create Blackle
if people use Blackle more often, so much energy can be saved, it is predicted about 750-megawatts a year. This is a hell of a lot energy!
So by using less energy, less carbon emissions are emitted.. thus helping prevent global warming &amp; saving polar bears &amp; doing all the things that are now under threat.. because it saves energy :))))


by going to:
http://www.blackle.com/about/
you can read a short, easy, yet good description about Blackle :)

the only problem with Blackle is:
you can not search for Images etc,,
just words. like "Web" on Google.

you should use Blackle. because it doesn't take ages to load, it's not difficult, yet it is so potentially benefiting
thank you
you should tell more people, if you want to :L
