  <description>Animal Testing, we all know it exsists. But what do we know about it?

We know that animals are given drug to see if they can cure desease. We know that the newest brand of shampoo has been tested on rabbits to make sure we aren't hurt by it.

But did you know that animals don't react to drugs and shapoos the same way we do. Also that many of the things that we use animals for tests, aren't nessisary, that we could use humans almost risk free. But that would cost money, and no one would want to spent money over an animal's life.
