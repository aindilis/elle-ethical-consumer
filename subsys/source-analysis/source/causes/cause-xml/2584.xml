  <description>During World War II, tens of thousands of Italian Canadians and  Americans were put in internment camps on Canadian and American  soil, along with Japanese Canadians and Americans. Thousands more were placed under surveillance or had their property repossessed by the government. Joe DiMaggio's father, who lived in San Francisco, had his boat and house confiscated. One official stated that if it had not been for Joe DiMaggio's status as a celebrity baseball player, his father would most likely had been sent to an internment camp. Unlike the Japanese Americans, Italian Canadians and Americans have never received reparations, even though President Bill Clinton made a public declaration admitting the US government's misjudgement in the internment.
