  <description>A movement was started to boycott Petro Canada in order to force a reduction in gas prices.

If everyone boycotts purchasing gas from Petro Canada, then they may be forced or inclined to lower gas prices.  If they due, all other will have to follow suit in order to remain competitive.

The secondary effect this may have is this will or may force Petro Canada to seek relief from the government of Canada via taxes which comprise a SIGNIFICANT portion of our gas price.

This will send a message to the government of Canada and to the major gas companies.

The initiative already started this is just another way to keep the momentum.

1. Gas prices are too high given Canada's buying power and gross domestic supply

2. Taxes on gas are too high and / or not being used appropriately to fund reduction in fossil fuels consumption and environmental initiatives

3. Private corporations are controlling prices and are taking advantage or minimal regulation and governance imposed by the Givernment</description>
