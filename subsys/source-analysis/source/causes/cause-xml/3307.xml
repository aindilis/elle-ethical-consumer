  <description>Our job is to explore a river somewhere in the world and let the people who live beside the river tell us their biggest need. It can be scientific, education,evangelistic, academic, or health related. Its their country, their village, their tribe but OUR problem! Now- whats the problem and how do WE adress it together?

1. Create &amp; Develop relationships with people around the world.
