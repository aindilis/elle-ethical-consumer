  <description>The London Humane Society was established in 1899.  It is a non- profit organization that receives no government support at any level, and therefore depends solely on individual and corporate donations.

Animal lovers have been supporting The London Humane Society as it goes out and offers shelter and care, including medical care, to hundreds of animals.  

From their website, here The London Humane Society's Mission Statement:

The mission of the London Humane Society is to improve the lives of animals in our community by providing temporary shelter and appropriate new families for unwanted or cruelly treated animals, and by providing education and advocacy, and by assisting animals in distress.

The London Humane Society (LHS) is under the umbrella of the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA).  You can donate online to the LHS and the OSPCA by going to http://londonhumanesociety.ca/ and http://ontariospca.ca/
