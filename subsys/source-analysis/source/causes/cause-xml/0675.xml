  <description>So:

There is an epidemic in the world of music. People are listening to the same music on the radio. Even when a new song comes out... it sounds the same! 

this needs to change. 
There are incredibly talented local bands that deserve your recognition. 

Some of these bands are: 
Fools and Horses
The Pale Stars
Splitsville
The Cheaters
LVT
Yesterday's news
and thats only naming a few!

Help by listening to a local radio station, if you live in Baltimore you can listen to 89.7 WTMD. They play a wide variety of music, and all of it is unknown or little known artists.

1. People must recognize the talents of Local Bands!

2. Listen to a local band you have not heard of before. Chances are they are pretty good!

3. Spread the word!</description>
