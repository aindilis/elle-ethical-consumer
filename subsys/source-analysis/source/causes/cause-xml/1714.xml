  <description>The SOS Children's Village idea is an important milestone in the development of a modern approach to the welfare of orphans.

The objectives are to:
Provide the children with an environment which is as normal as possible.
Give the children every opportunity to develop to their full potential.
Equip the child with the necessary skills to lead an independent life.
Integrate the orphan child with society so that he does not suffer from lack of a
normal family.
 
SOS Children's Villages are institutions established to give orphaned or abandoned children a new start in life by providing a substitute for the familiy they have lost. This is achieved by the formation of 'families' which are as natural as possible. The children are given security, support, love and understanding.

The resemblance to a natural family is achieved through four basic principles...The Home, The Mother, The Brother and Sister, The Village.
