  <description>Research and develop a plan to help aid homeless youth throughout CT.  In CT there are many family shelter but very few shelters or aid for homeless youth ages 12-17 that are without parental guidance.  It is the hope of our organization to bring resources and aid to this population.

1. All youth have a right to shelter,food, and aid

2. All youth have a right to feel safe and be protected

3. All youth have a right be helped even without parental support</description>
