  <description>For the last 60 years, America, Russia, England and other countries have illegally funded movements in countries like Vietnam, Korea, Somalia, Iran and Afghanistan.
This has led to the burgeoning illegal arms trade throughout the world, claiming more lives than can be counted.
Al Quaeda, Taliban, the Contras,  the gangs of Mogadishu, drug smugglers and mercenaries- soldiers of fortune, are all byproducts of the arms trade.
Human rights abuse too is a direct offshoot of the arms trade.
Children as young as 12 are made shooters in Africa and Asia, and children of the same ages are made suicide bombers in the Middle East. Stop this exploitation of children.
Illegal arms are the cause of most of the world's peacetime human rights abuses. Lets make our contribution to stopping them.

1. Stop the use of arms as far as possible.

2. Prevent the provision of AID in the form of arms to developing countries.

3. Put all major ports under the sceening of an international agency.</description>
