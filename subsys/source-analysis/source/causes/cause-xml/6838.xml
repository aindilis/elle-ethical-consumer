  <description>ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease is a devastating, degenerative, neurological disorder for which there is no known cause and no known cure.  Symptoms for ALS can be treated to the best of modern medical capabilities, but eventually the progression of the disease cannot be stopped or prevented. Please visit http://www.alsa.org to donate money towards research in the fight against ALS.
