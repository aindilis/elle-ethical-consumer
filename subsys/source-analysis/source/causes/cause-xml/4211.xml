  <description>Hi everyone - Thanks for joining The Safe Haven Project cause. Our goal is to gather many folks like you who want to make a real difference in the lives of young people living with HIV and AIDS here and in Africa. What can you do? Well there are many things. 

1- Help us raise the funds to support our mission. Needless to say, it takes money to make our mission happen. These days there are so many issues that affect all of us yet, the need to provide the services and programs of Safe Haven is more important than ever. Your direct financial support will make a profound difference and will be directly applied to our mission

1. Together we can make a difference</description>
