  <description>I stongly think that if anyone feels as stronly about child abuse as i do you should look it up, you can find videos on youtube and articles on goole.  Please be aware of this issue and if you ever become suspicious of of what you think could be an act of child abuse please, please call social services or the police.  

1. Children have not done anything wrong

2. Stop the abuse before it leads to death

3. And please if you are an abuser, give up your child.  They don't deserve it!!</description>
