  <description>Global Warming: Something that Gore made a slide show about so he has an excuse to ask for peoples money.

The earth goes through natural warming and cooling trends. Right now we are in a warming trend. Back in the mid 1900's, they were screaming about global cooling, wtf!? So shut up.

PLEASE NOTE: Don't donate, because we don't want that crazy lady to have our money, I just couldn't find a more laughable cause for money to go to.

1. Laugh at Al Gore

2. Destroy every copy of An Inconvenient Truth in existence

3. Make "I Heart Global Warming" shirts</description>
