  <description>Immigrants make up 16.9% of the US population. 14.7% are almost never granted a job because of their background. Some have to cross the border ilegally because they are desperate and angry because the US has never given them a brake. This cause is made for people who believe Immigrants should enter the US if they show great skills of respect.

1. Immigrants should be granted green cards if they show that they are good members of society.

2. The construction of a large wall over the US-Mexico border should be stopped.</description>
