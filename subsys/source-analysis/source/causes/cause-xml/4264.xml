  <description>For many years the Vietnamese have been pursuing diplomatic channels to get the US government to accept responsibility for the health and environmental consequences of toxic herbicides used by the US during the war in Viet Nam. However, these negotiations did not get very far. The US continues to insist that more scientific research is needed in order to address this issue, whereas the Vietnamese continue to stress the need for immediate humanitarian assistance for the victims. As a result, many in Vietnam become frustrated that nothing was being done to assist those whose health had been adversely impacted by Agent Orange, even though the US currently provides compensation for US veterans who became ill from their exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam.
