  <description>Hi guys 

Hi guys,

Just wanna say get ur hands in your pocket and sponsor me plz .

Im not sure you all know but earlier this year i lost my granddad to cancer it was the first time ive lost anyone in family and it hit me kinda hard seeing as ive never had to experience as loss in my family before.

I dont want no one else to lose any close family member or friend  to cancer so i wanna do my bit and try and help the cause , so if you could sponsor me i would be extremely grateful ( ill even run like forest gump 4 u guys )


Donating through this site is simple, fast and totally secure. It is also the most efficient way to sponsor me: Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK will receive your money faster and, if you are a UK taxpayer, an extra 28% in tax will be added to your gift at no cost to you.

So please sponsor me now!
