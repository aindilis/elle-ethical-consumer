  <description>The online Distributed Proofreaders community at www.pgdp.net creates accurate, useful, free electronic editions of public domain books and magazines. We preserve history one page at a time.

1. Public Domain texts should be preserved and made available on line.

2. Electronic text is more useful than pictures of pages.

3. Community is what makes our work possible.</description>
