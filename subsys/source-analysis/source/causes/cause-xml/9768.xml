  <description>Adom means "grace" in the Akan language of Ghana. The vision of the Adom Partnership International is to create services to meet the physical and spiritual needs of Ghanaians in impoverished village areas through a network of programs encompassing education, healthcare, and economic development. These programs create jobs for local people who will be employed by the projects, from school teachers and healthcare professionals to drivers, cooks and maintenance people.  Currently, this mission is primarily carried out through the work of Ghanaian leaders at the Amazing Grace Preparatory School in Kodiekrom, Ghana.
