  <description>I just thought that this would be a good way to connect with each other and have someone to lean on when things get tough! Share what works for you and your child!

1. Just parents supporting other parents who have children with these medical conditions! 

2. Ideas and thoughts that may help make life more enjoyable for these kids!</description>
