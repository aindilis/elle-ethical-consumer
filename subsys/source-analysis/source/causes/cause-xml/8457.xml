  <description>everyone looks down on gays because they found love in someone of the same sex.  Most people are against discriminating people of different races and religions, so what makes this any different?  Gays and lesbians aren't any different than you or me.  They should have the right to bond with the person they love through marriage like everyone else.  it shouldn't be illegal just because they are the same sex, they still love each other just as much as anyone else.

it is a univeral right to be with the person you love, regardless of gender.
if church and state really are seperated, then legalize same sex marriage.  i thought we had freedom in America.....

1. discrimination against gays has to stop

2. legalize same sex marriage</description>
