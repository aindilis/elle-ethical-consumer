  <description>The IHF is a national 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to connecting college students eager to make a difference in the developing world with opportunities to do so. The IHF promotes grassroots social and economic development by focusing the resources of US academic communities on the self-stated goals of communities abroad. Our model serves the needs of all involved. Communities abroad- our partners- retain control of the development process while gaining access to otherwise inaccessible resources. Students in US academic communities have real-world opportunities for learning and growth.

We have active projects in India and throughout Latin America, focused primarily on rural health and education initiatives such as installing smoke-free cookstoves and providing children with scholarships to attend secondary school.
