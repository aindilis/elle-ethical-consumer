  <description>Rudy Giuliani was a terrible mayor and had no respect for Constitutional rights. He abused his power, and created a climate of fear and intimidation in communities of color. This group is dedicated to preventing Giuliani from ever gaining higher office. We believe that Giuliani could not even take his oath of office, swearing to uphold the Constitution, since he does not even know what the Constitution is. We will work to educate the public, particularly non-New Yorkers, who are ignorant of Giuliani's reign of terror, about the harm Giuliani has done, and his lack of qualifications for the Presidency.

1. Rudolph Giuliani would be a worse president than George W. Bush

2. Rudolph Giuliani has no respect for the U.S. Constitution.

3. The American public is severely ignorant of how much New Yorkers hate Giuliani.

4. Giuliani played only a small part in lowering crime in NYC. In reality, the decline in crime was due to the ideas of Police Commissioner Bratton and a nationwide decline in crime.</description>
