  <description>The Diveheart Foundation was founded in Early 2001 and is a non-profit tax exempt national organization chartered in the state of Illinois.  The purpose of Diveheart is to provide and support educational SCUBA diving and snorkeling experience programs that are open to any physically impaired child or adult in the hope of providing both physical and psychological therapeutic value to that person. 

The people need your help, and you can help them to get better scuba gear such as matching swim fins, wet-suits, breathing tubes for certain personals, and even special goggles for the blind that go scuba diving.

This is the only diveheart cause on facebook, and the cause is worth it. I will NOT send out the invites for people to join the cause, but I'll tell people about it. For every person that joins, I'll put a dollar to Diveheart, invite your friends=)
