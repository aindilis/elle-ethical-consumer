  <description>The Hip Hop Congress of Baltimore is a non-profit looking for support in the Hip Hop community. There are so many positive things that could be happening that are not and we intend to change that. Join us to build a network a individuals willing to pull together to use the culture that we created to benefit us, instead of the capitalist mass media corporations that currently have control of it. The movement is only as strong as it's members but we are growing. Tell everyone you know, if they are apart of hip hop then they are apart of us.

1. We must take back hip hop and integrate it into our urban education systems.

2. We must combat stereotypes associated with the culture by promoting positive hip hop and artists.

3. We must integrate political tools like debate with hip hop to give our community a voice to make change.</description>
