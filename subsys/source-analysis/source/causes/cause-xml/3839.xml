  <description>"We reject war as a means of resolving international disputes. We're creating a community-based model that empowers communities to provide direct assistance to victims of aggression. We find medical sponsorships for war-injured Iraqi children and work to forge ties between the children, their families and communities in the United States."

"January 9th, 2006 - Omar was traveling from Mosul to Baghdad with his mother, father, and brother to celebrate Eid. Near Samarra, their passanger vehicle came under fire from US forces. Omar's mother was killed. The driver and two other passengers also died at the scene."

"Omar was severely burned and needs extensive reconstructive surgery. He's receiving medical treatment in Boston, thanks to the hard work of local volunteers and the generosity of Children's Hospital." However, there are still thousands of dollars that are not being covered by the Children's Hospital.
