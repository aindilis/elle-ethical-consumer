  <description>To successfully elect Weston Fillman to a Student Senate Seat this coming fall at Franlkin &amp; Marshall.

I feel that I can make a difference and I believe that a lot of students have faith in me that my extroverted personality combined with my drive and ambition, I can help to make F&amp;M a better place and serve my constituents (F&amp;M Students) to the best of my ability.

1. To Elect Weston Fillman to a Student Senate Position.

2. To promote fair elections and elect a class leader that is compassionate for not only his fellow students but the college.

3. Elect a student that cares about the direction of the college and one who will work hard to change the class and college for the better.</description>
