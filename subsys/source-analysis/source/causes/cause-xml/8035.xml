  <description>No one really knows it, but KFC tortures billions of chickens every year. The chickens are put through so many in-humane acts. For example, they are kicked, stomped on, spray painted, have there heads twisted off, and are dumped in scalding water, all while they are alive. So think about it, do you want to eat KFC chicken, while knowing that the chicken was tortued?!

1. Everyone must stop eating from KFC until they change. 

2. All animals have rights, even chickens

3. If KFC was doing this to cats and dogs, they would be charged with COUNTLESS acts of animal cruelty.</description>
