1 Timothy 4:12
Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity. 

Matthew 28:19 
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

Colossians 3:23:
Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men.

"something i'm realizing. it's not enough to simply try not to do wrong. we must also make an effort to do right. if you look through the Bible, God tells us many times what not to do, but he also tells us what we must do. and if we don't pay attention to the "do's" but just to the "don'ts" then we're not doing what God has asked of us. He tells us "Go and make disciples of all nations". He tells us to go. He never says that it's a sin not to go, but it's just as bad as lying if we ignore a command from God"
