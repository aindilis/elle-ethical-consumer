  <description>"Net neutrality"?  More like "Net Regulation".  There are currently no laws restricting internet use and I'd say the net is as healthy as ever!  In fact, competition for internet access is ever increasing and there is no reason to believe there are any risks involved in keeping it free.

Do you want to pay taxes for the internet?
Do you want the government to track your private information?  
Do you want to stifle competition and innovation?

I don't.

1. The internet is free.

2. The internet will continue to be free.
