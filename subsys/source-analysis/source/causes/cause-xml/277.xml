  <description>Ontario has the green power potential to meet our future electricity needs and to protect our environment, health and economy without using coal or nuclear power. 

This group is for anyone @ Queen's University who wants to work towards a green energy strategy for Ontario. 

1. I will say it once more: Ontario has the green power potential to meet our future electricity needs and to protect our environment, health and economy without using coal or nuclear power. 

2. The long term energy plan released by the Ontario government in June 2006 will jeopardize our ability to tap into that potential for decades. The next provincial general election will be held on Wednesday, October 10, 2007 so we have work to do! 

3. We are the clean, green, and decentralized fighting machines! </description>
