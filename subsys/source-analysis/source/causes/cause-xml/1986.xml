  <description>This is for anyone and everyone that has Made, is Making or would like to make a Difference for Tyler Watton. Tyler is a 13 year old who was diagnosed with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex as a baby. He has been heavily medicated since then for the incurable disease. In December 06, everyone pulled together at the M.A.D 4 Tyler fundraiser to raise the funds to send Tyler to Boston so he could receive the proper medicine and treatment. It was then that Tyler and his family were informed he had been misdiagnosed as a baby and has been taking medicine for a disease he doesn't have. Now, very expensive testing is taking place in Boston to help find a diagnosis and a cure for Tyler's terrible seizures. 

1. HOSPITALS ARE NOT BUSINESSES AND SHOULD NOT BE RUN IN THE SAME MANNER

2. NO CHILD SHOULD SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM</description>
