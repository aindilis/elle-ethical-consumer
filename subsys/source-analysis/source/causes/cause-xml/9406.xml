  <description>animals are entitled to our protection from harm and abuse.  they are our equals in most ways if you stop and think.  i'm not popular for this thought but they are much like human babies,...equal but still needing us for so many things....don't automatically judge and dismiss...think...

1. animals need us for protection against harm and abuse

2. animals are much like humans in their instincts to procreate, raise and protect their offspring

3. just because they're not quite as advanced as we are doesn't mean s**t.  imagine a helpless baby....well....that is an animal.  do i sound superior?  yes.  but  i'm not.  if you stop and consider,  i mean, honestly,  we are not above, simply, for whatever

4. position you take,  animals will never be our equals intellectually,,, so...love and protect......</description>
