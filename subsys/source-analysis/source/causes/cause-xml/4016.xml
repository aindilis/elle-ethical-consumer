  <description>My main goal in life is to do whatever i can in my will to unite muslims.
the world of islam is at war the heart of muslims are yet apart. till this day we fight among each other. 
No wonder why our oppressors take advantage of our weekness.

Iraq, Bosnia, Kashmire, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Palestine, Somalia, and many more are the victim of western politics. 

Its time that we unite and recognize our power even being in majority we are treated as minority. 

Lets all Take a moment from our lives spending some time talking to other muslims help support the cause.
Prohpet Mohammed (PBUH) didnt wish to see his ummah fallen apart like this.


1. Suni Shia BS got to end
