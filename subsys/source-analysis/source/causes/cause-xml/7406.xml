  <description>THIS CAUSE DOESN'T REQUIRE DONATIONS BUT I HAD TO SELECT A BENEFICIARY IN ORDER TO POST IT.  READ THE PETITION - SIGN IF YOU AGREE - DISCUSS THE QUESTION - WRITE TO YOUR MP, etc., etc.

In Britain, all kinds of public servants are required to take oaths of allegiance.  If republicans want to take office, they are expected to begin their careers with a public lie, proclaiming allegiance to the queen and her heirs.  Dishonest republicans are allowed to take office but honest republicans are barred.  It's time to change this.

British citizens and residents should sign the petition at:

http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/Republicanism/

Remember to click the e-mail link after signing.


Note:  You don't have to be a republican to sign this.  If you think constituents should be allowed to choose a republican to represent them, this group is for you.


I can't find a British beneficiary and I'm not asking for cash.  Please sign the petition and discuss the cause with others.  200 signatures means a government response.  20 million signatures mught just change government policy.  Try out the power of Facebook.

1. Voters should be allowed to elect honest Republican Members of Parliament to represent them.

2. Public office should be open to honest anti-monarchists
