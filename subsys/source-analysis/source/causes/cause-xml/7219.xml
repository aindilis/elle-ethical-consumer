  <description>&lt;a href="http://mdat.org"&gt;Mission Data International&lt;/a&gt; (M-DAT) is an innovative ministry creating websites to help people take their next step in missions. Every step forward in missions involvement requires intentionality and sacrifice, whether people are going, giving, praying, sending, welcoming or mentoring.

The internet enables us to reach a large audience and puts information where people today expect to find it. When people go looking for "missions" online we want them to find what they need.

M-DAT is known for &lt;a href="http://shorttermmissions.com"&gt;ShortTermMissions.com&lt;/a&gt;, the mission trip search engine, which launched in 2000.

Your support of Mission Data International will help us continue improving ShortTermMissions.com as well as allowing us to create new websites. Our goal in 2008 is to launch a long-term mission website (&lt;a href="http://preparingtogo.com"&gt;PreparingToGo.com&lt;/a&gt;), helping people get plugged into career missions.
