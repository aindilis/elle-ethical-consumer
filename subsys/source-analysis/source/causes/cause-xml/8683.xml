  <description>This organization is to help raise awareness  of what being fat is and what being fat isn't.

We want to promote healthy lifestyles at ANY size.

We want to teach our young men and women that they don't have to become anorexic to be beautiful or happy.

We want to promote students in high school and college to start fat acceptance groups on campus.

Most importantly we want to teach the love of all people  regardless of ages, size, sex, color, or sexual orientation.

1. Beauty comes in every size and shape

2. Size discrimination in the workplace needs to stop immediately

3. Big is beautiful too</description>
