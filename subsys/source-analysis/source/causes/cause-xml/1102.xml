  <description>The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), was founded in 1948 by a group of just 28 individuals. These founding members anticipated the need for a national organization to represent the personnel profession. Their goal was to provide continued professional development opportunities, promote national networking, and to generally advance the interests of a profession they recognized as being in transition. The Society's first annual conference, which was held in Cleveland, received a total of 67 attendees and generated a net profit of $72.86. 
 
Today, under the leadership of President &amp; CEO Susan R. Meisinger, SPHR, SHRM includes a global membership of more than 200,000. SHRM has members in 120 countries including Canada, China, United Kingdom, Australia, Bermuda, Japan, Singapore, Trinidad, Bahamas and Germany.
