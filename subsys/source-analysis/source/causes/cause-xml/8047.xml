  <description>Hey. The more I think to myself that gays can not get married, I realize how dumb it is. After all, people have fought and died to help this and other equal rights causes; but still everyone is not equal. Why is it such a big deal? Allowing two males or two females to live their lives together does not effect others, it just makes it more official. There is more than enough people to turn this world around, so lets start. But we must start now, if tickle me elmo can go world wide so can this. 

1. Gays should be allowed to get married

2. Eveyone deserves equal rights </description>
