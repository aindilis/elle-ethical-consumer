  <description>I have come across websites in passing that actually teach people different ways to harm themselves, such as cutting. You may not think there are different ways to cut yourself, but there are many ways. Teaching people what to use or how to do it is wrong and should be deemed illegal. I will not list other forms of self mutilation because it can give people different ideas and I would be sinking to that level. If you believe that it is wrong to support these behaviors, join this cause.
