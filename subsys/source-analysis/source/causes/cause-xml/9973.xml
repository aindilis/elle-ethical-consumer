  <description>M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res (MSF) is an international humanitarian aid organization that provides emergency medical assistance to populations in danger in more than 70 countries.

In countries where health structures are insufficient or even non-existant, MSF collaborates with authorities such as the Ministry of Health to provide assistance. MSF works in rehabilitation of hospitals and dispensaries, vaccination programmes and water and sanitation projects. MSF also works in remote health care centres, slum areas and provides training of local personnel. All this is done with the objective of rebuilding health structures to acceptable levels.
