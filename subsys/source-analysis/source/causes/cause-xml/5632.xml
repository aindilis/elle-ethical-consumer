  <description>We are a team of super enthusiastic humanitarian filmmakers, with a heart for the third world.
In October 2007, our team (Greg Meeres, Kevin Shannon, Rose Ranger and Amy Robinson) will be travelling to Mozambique and Zimbabwe on a journey that will lead us to offer our services and hearts to the local people. Through this we aim to capture on film their voice and their story.
Our project is basic, but is what we call a 'passion project', done purely for the love of it....not the money.
To get to Africa, film and work for one month and return to edit our project we are depending on the love and support of friends and our community. This is definatley the first time any of us have put out a call for funding, but we really believe that our vision to see this project through is reliant on the belief and unity of others. 
To put it like this our mission needs your contribution.
This documentary will be pitched to the TV networks in Australia and Canada and be hitting the film festival circuits globally....yay!
