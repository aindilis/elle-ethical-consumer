  <description>The Myelin Sheath is a insulation around the axon of a nerve cell. It allows the signal to be transmitted along the nerve more rapidly and efficiently. 

Multiple Sclerosis is an example of a disease caused by a deteriorating Myelin Sheath. It is known as an autoimmune disease as the body through the immune system launches a defense attack against the myelin believing it to be foreign and dangerous. 

This sudden change in the behaviour of the immune system can be brought about by outside environmental factors or viruses.
