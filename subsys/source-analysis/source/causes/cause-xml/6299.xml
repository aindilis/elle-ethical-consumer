  <description> For one week, these young people are able to shift their focus away from sterile medical environments and the language of their disability or illness to focus on activities that build their courage and expand their belief in themselves. Many people with special medical needs endure unthinkable pain and isolating treatments for diseases or disabilities such as cerebral palsy, autism, developmental challenges, deaf/hard-of-hearing, blind, cancer, hemophilia, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, AIDS and many more more. Their need for acceptance is overwhelming!
