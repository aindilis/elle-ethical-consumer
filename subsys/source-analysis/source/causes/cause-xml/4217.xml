  <description>Zaphod Beeblebrox is this two-headed frood who was once the president of the galaxy. We want to see the guy back in power.

His opponent in the previous Presidential election had used the slogan "Don't vote for stupid". It's time to show them, who the idiot is! 

To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. 
To summarize the summary: anyone capable of getting themselves made President should by no means be allowed to do the job.
 To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem.

1. Zaphod Beeblebrox is *the* hoopiest frood around

2. Douglas Adams may be one possible exception

3. The HitchHikers' Guide to the Galaxy sells slightly better than the Encylopedia Galactica</description>
