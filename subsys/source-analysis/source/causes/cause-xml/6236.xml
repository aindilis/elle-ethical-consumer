  <description>The Goals of VOV
1. To promote awareness, introspection and the spirit of non-violence through dialogue among our youth, our families, our schools and our communities in order to inspire and awaken the energies for positive change.

2. To provide "a source of hope and courage for young people who have suffered the effects of violence."

3. To "transform the tendency to downplay the sanctity of life that became deeply rooted in the minds of our children during the twentieth century, the century of war and violence."
