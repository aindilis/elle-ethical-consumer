  <description>Cheechizm is whatever you want it to be. Anyone can join as long as you love Chihuts the master and creator of this religion. Chihuts is a very wise and generous master and he will decide what is answered and what is not. If you see Chihuts make sure you give him a hug to show your compassion and respect for this Great being. As i said above anyone can join but there are three small conditions
1. Love and Respect Chihuts becasue he IS the man.
2. You gotta love animals even the ugly ones.
3. When Chihuts holla's...Holla Back

1. Who else but Chihuts like come on!</description>
