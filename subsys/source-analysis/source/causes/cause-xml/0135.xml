  <description>Camp Kesem (kesem means "magic" in Hebrew) is a week-long summer camp offered completely free of charge to children in the Bay Area with a parent who has been diagnosed with or died from cancer.  Camp is planned and run completely by volunteer Stanford students.  We provide an opportunity for children facing unique and challenging circumstances to experience life as other children are able. Camp activities are in many ways similar to those of a general summer camp for children and will include arts and crafts, drama, swimming, nature activities, sports, music, and a ropes course. With a camper-counselor ratio of 2:1, campers will receive the special attention and support that they would not receive at a regular overnight summer camp.
