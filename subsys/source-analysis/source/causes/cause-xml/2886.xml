  <description>We try to keep our purpose balanced through the inspirations of Air, Fire, Water, and Earth: 

Air: Education 
We're never going to be able to practice our spiritual paths openly if we don't give the public accurate information about what we do and do not do. 

Fire: Activism 
People aren't necessarily going to go out of their way to find out what Pagans really do. We have to have the courage to act on our convictions and do what we need to do. 

Water: Charity 
We know that what we do returns to us. We need to demonstrate this by offering compassion to our communities where it is needed. When we share our own abundance, we show that we trust the Gods to share abundance with us in return. 

Earth: Community 
We're never going to be able to practice openly if we don't know anyone else in our local Pagan communities. We need to weave networking webs in our cities, in our towns, in our rural areas. We need these webs to support one another. That support will also show those who would restrict our practice that we are not just a few isolated wackos, but are a growing congregation of people who adhere to a faith that, while different, is as valid as their own.
