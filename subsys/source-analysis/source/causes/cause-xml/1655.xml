  <description>millions of Copt orthodoxs are being tortured and killed in the middle east everyday, for no other reason than being Christians. We must put an end to this discrimination and put an end to these barbaric prosecutions

1. I believe everyone should have the freedom of religion

2. no one should live in fear and endure torture and death for what they believe in</description>
