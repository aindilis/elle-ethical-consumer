  <description>Started up as a garage project after my two grandfathers (J.R.Saha &amp; P.L.Coondoo) expired in '05... it's a humble collection of books people dont want to keep... children's illustration books, drawing pads, pen n paper if any, anything that can help educate... the proceeds shall be donated to NPOs and Social Causes across Delhi and maybe someday, All India. No Monetary donations needed, no tax funds... just plain trust and respect for the needs...
send in ur donations in the form of books (stamps and envelopes dont cost much guys)
Address:
The Saha &amp; Coondoo Memorial Book Donation
Aurovilla
J-1951 Chittaranjan Park
New Delhi - 110019
