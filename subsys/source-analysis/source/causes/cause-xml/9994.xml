  <description>January 3, 2007- Alyssa, a beautiful, happy, healthy  two and a half year old girl had a piece of chicken nugget get stuck in her airway, completely blocking it off.  She was no longer with us for 10 minutes.  By a miracle of God, Alyssa was brought back to us but is now in very critical condition from being without oxygen for so long.  She has a trach tube to breath, a g-tube to eat, is blind and does not respond very much.  We hope and pray for any recovery.  There are many therapies that can help her recover and may make her laugh again someday, unfortunately these therapies are expensive.
