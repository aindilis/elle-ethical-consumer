  <description>Subject: Our Palestinian Kids&#8230;

 

Childhood should be filled with happiness&#8230; Full of fun and playful memories&#8230; Both rich and poor children should have these&#8230;

 

But not our Palestinian kids&#8230; The main reason stopping them? Israel&#8230;

 

Because of them, our kids play with bullets, while their kids play with toys&#8230;

 

Their kids watch cartoons in the comfort of their home, while our kids watch the news under the terrifying battles on their grounds&#8230;

 

Their kids were born smiling, while our kids didn&#8217;t even learn how to smile&#8230;

 

Their kids eat chicken from KFC and burgers from McDonalds, while our kids look around just for bread&#8230;

 

 

Israel has done so much damage to our kids and what their childhood could have been, and we watch and don't do much&#8230;

 

Please help us in trying to give them at least a little comfort of what we have, fill their memories with a little fun and enjoyment&#8230;
