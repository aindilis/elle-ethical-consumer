  <description>America is a strong and wealthy country. However, it's slowly dieing on us. Yes, there are more countries out less fortunate than us, but we have a duty to our country to keep her strong. 

As a country we are already so torn up from politics, wars, and hundreds of other things. we need to unite as a country. Sure keep your political ideas and your opinions, but please don't forget about the land of the free. We have cities in america that need our help.

Many countries such as Darfur are in poor wealth, health, and literacy status. They get so much money from us, but don't you think that we need to focus on ourselves first. I know this sounds greedy and self-centered, but when you look at the larger picture, we need to help ourselves before we can help them. It's like working on an empty stomach; Your no good to someone until you have eaten and are ready to focus all your efforts on what they need. 

So America, I say that we pull together, feed our own, replenish our own, so that when we are good and full and peace reigns throught out our land. Then and only then we shall focus our efforts to those that need us most.
