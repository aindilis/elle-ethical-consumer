  <description>In Leadership Inc. (L'Inc.), the youth of Kuwait hold events and fundraisers that are formulated and organized by the students and for the students. These events help our youth in aquiring leadership skills as well as meeting new people. It also changes the idea of having nothing to do in Kuwait.

Through the money raised by L'Inc., we help many charites. One of these is the "Free The Children" Charity. This charity's money goes to taking children (mainly in Africa) out of child labor and in to school where they belong. Please join to be the change and free the children.

 

1. Children should not be forced to work.

2. Every human has a right for education.</description>
