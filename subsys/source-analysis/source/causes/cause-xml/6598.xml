  <description>Those held in the Guantanamo Bay should be released unless they are to be charged and tried in accordance with international standards of fair trial. No detainees who are released should be forcibly sent to their country of origin or other countries where they may face serious human rights abuses. Indeed, it is crucial that emptying and closing down the Guant&#225;namo camp not result in a transfer of the human rights violations elsewhere.
