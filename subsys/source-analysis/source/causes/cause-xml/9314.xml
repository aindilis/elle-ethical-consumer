  <description>few individuals in modern society realise and accept self-mutilation, whether it is their own or that of others, as a serious societal issue. modern media and stereotyping has perverted masochistic habits such as cutting oneself, burning oneself, etc into either typical and therefore ignorable occurances in the lives of troubled individuals, or the butt-ends of inappropriate jokes.&lt;p&gt;

there is nothing funny about someone "slitting their wrists" or "cutting themselves up"&lt;p&gt; 

- SELF-HARM IS JUST AS DESTRUCTIVE AND SERIOUS AN ISSUE IN INDIVIDUALS OF ALL AGES, SOCIAL CLASSES, AND FAMILY SITUATIONS AS THOSE OF DRUG-ADDICTION AND ALCOHOLISM.

1. self-mutilation is a serious issue in individuals of all age groups, social classes, etc.

2. it should be dually noted as just as destructive and serious as all other harmful addictions.

3. it is not something to be poked fun at or ignored, but to be understood, accepted, and dealt with.</description>
