  <description>One and one-half acres of rainforest are lost every second with tragic consequences for both developing and industrial countries. That means less clean oxygen for us and less living space for the creatures we adore. Yes that means less homes for the monkeys, birds, wild cats, etc. Please help to save the rainforests, it is for the good of the planet.

1. Loss of Rainforest means loss of millions of different plant, animal and insect species, some not yet known to man.

3. Continuously recyling carbon dioxide into oxygen.

4. Full of plants that make up half of the medicines we have

5. At least 80% of the developed world's diet originated in the tropical rainforest.

6. 3000 plants were identified to be active against cancer cells, 70% of those are found in the rainforests.

7. The rainforests have more economic value through its many nuts, fruits, oil-producing plants, and medicinal plants than it does if it were cut down by making land for cattle or timber.
