  <description>As a grassroots organization, the Elias Fund focuses on indigenous empowerment to alleviate poverty from the bottom-up. This happens via strategic partnerships with Zimbabwean community organizations. Currently, EF&#8217;s three partner organizations utilize education, food aid and micro-grants as poverty alleviating tools.

In 2005 brothers Eric and Scott Byington met Elias Sithole, a father raising his children in a struggling Zimbabwean community. With a grassroots based support group, Eric and Scott turned their relationship with Elias into the movement the Elias Fund is today.
