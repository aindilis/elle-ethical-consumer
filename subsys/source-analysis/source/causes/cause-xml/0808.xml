  <description>We can use any help to support this upcoming June 2008 session. Also we are working on building more big brother / big sister program.

Camp Chesed is the first FREE camp for Jewish special needs children in Southern California. We have been around for 13 years and everyone (yes even the administration) volunteer and work for the camp absolutely free. Every dollar donated goes directly to special needs children. These kids get a two week experience that brings them to amusement parks like Disneyland and Universal Studios, activities, movies, more trips, and a big award party. Every dollar helps and if you contribute I guarantee that you will help make a special needs child's day. You can search for the group Camp Chesed and see some pictures from last years session. 

INVITE YOUR FRIENDS! 

This years Camp session is June 25th-July 6th.
If you want to attend please contact me or if you have any ideas on how you can contribute please let me know.
