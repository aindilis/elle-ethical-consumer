  <description>Mesothelioma is a rare and virulent form of cancer that affects the lining of the lung, lining of the abdominal cavity or lining around the heart. Mesothelioma is caused by exposure to asbestos, and occurs in those who have breathed in asbestos fiber, in many cases 20 to 50 or more years ago. Some were exposed on their jobs; others were exposed secondarily through family members who without their knowledge, brought fiber home on their work clothes or on their hair or skin.
