  <description>The state of affairs is unacceptable and an affront to any reasonable notion of a fair and democratic society. We believe that the appropriate response is to articulate, and mobilize in support of, a clear vision of how a fair and just society should provide access to higher education. We propose that all academically qualified students who desire an education should be able to get one&#8212;without constraint by cost or the need to amass crippling debt. We believe this proposal crystallizes a clear, simple vision. And it is not outside the political mainstream.

 Unlike other needed social programs, such as national health care, free higher education does not require massive amounts of money or the creation of a huge new bureaucracy. 

Making all education free is not only the right, rational, and just thing to do. It is also a goal that can be won in the foreseeable future. 

1. Quality education is universal human right.

2. Education is a vehicle for the advancement of society.

3. Education can be fully financially sustained by governments.</description>
