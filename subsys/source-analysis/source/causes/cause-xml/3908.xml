  <description>"The Red Sox Foundation is the official team charity of the Boston Red Sox. Our primary focus is in serving the health, education, recreation, and social service needs of children and families in need across New England. Our goal is to harness the passion our fans have for the Red Sox and transform into a vehicle for positive change in our community. 

A registered 501(c)3 charity, the Foundation was founded in 2002, immediately after the group led by Principal Owner John Henry and Chairman Tom Werner bought the Red Sox. They and their partners made generous commitments, more than $18 million over 10 years, making the Red Sox Foundation the largest professional sports charity in New England and one of the largest in Major League Baseball." ~http://www.redsoxfoundation.org/what/index.htm
