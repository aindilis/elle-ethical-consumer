  <description>The India Rural Development Fund (www.indiarural.org) with its Indian partner (www.rdfindia.org) started by helping establish a single school in Kalleda Village in the Southern Indian State of Andhra Pradesh. 

10 Years later, they expanded to more than 5 schools with more than 2000 students.

Besides the excellent education progress in these schools (www.rdfindia.org/education.htm), the schools have also produced international level archers.
