  <description>The economic crises in Zimbabwe is worsening at an alarming rate. At the beginning of 2007, Zimbabwe&#8217;s inflation rose to 1,281.1%, the highest in the world by far. Unemployment is over 85 %, poverty over 90 %, and foreign reserves are almost depleted. Over four million persons are in desperate need of food. One in four citizens are HIV positive. Coupled with severe malnutrition, thousands are dying every month. To do something as simple as buying a loaf of bread is near impossible for most zimbabwean families. Combined with a consistent lack of potable water, power, perpetual regional drought, over all environmental degradation and the recent displacement of hundreds of thousands desperately poor from urban areas, the country is on the brink of ruin. One scary situation is that the average age of living is under 40 years old for both male and female.  Please realize how important it is to save these people!


1. the poverty rate must decrease
