  <description>Beginning at 1:00 on October 13th, 450 teams will start the 2007 Fall Crawl for Cancer pub crawl.  Each team will make their way to 5 bars, drink 4 pitchers at each bar, and finish up at the Beaumont for the after-party with live music and even more beer.  You must be part of a team to participate so make sure you find a team captain and join early.  I'm leading at least one team from my office but anyone is welcome to join.  

I don't know how to get the donations tab off this page so don't worry about that.  It costs $45 to join a team which includes beer all day and a t-shirt.  Yea, that's right, I said a t-shirt.  Well worth the $45.  

1. Umm.... it's for a good cause.</description>
  <mission>Drink until we have to crawl.  Oh yea, raise money for the American Cancer Society.</mission>
