  <description>The internet was once a hallowed and sacred place, full of lulz, cats, and free of AIDS. With the onset of new websites like LiveJournal, MySpace, Gaia, Second Life, among others, the internet lost the lulz it once had. Millions of people worldwide are starting blogs, posting shitty YouTube videos and cluttering their MySpaces with lethargically coded bullshit in the hopes that maybe someone will think that they are a unique individual. Well, we have news for you: YOU ARE NOT.

You are a mere shank of meat floating on a tiny speck of dust in the vastness of existence. The universe will not stop to think about what music you listened to or the fight you just had with your skanky bitch girlfriend. We, the defenders of the internet, have realized this and have embraced our insignificance and anonymity. We are here to remind other of this, and to take back the internet and restore it to its former glory. Furfags, emos, and the politically correct will be knocked off their virtual high horses and sent running into the night, haunted by pictures they never want to see, stories they never want to hear, and memories they will never want to remember, all while we laugh. No one will be spared, not even the children.



1. Fursecution will be resisted.

2. Every day will be Caturday.

3. If it provides the lulz, it is raidable and therefore fair game.</description>
