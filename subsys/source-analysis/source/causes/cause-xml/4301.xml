  <description>People throw an empty can on the floor without even battering an eyelid. We let corporate giants take over lands that were given to us. We have just as much rites to that land as they do. This earth was given to us to share with one another, to bring us together, and somewhere along the way, we let ourselves slip. We have one last chance to save her before she is gone forever. If she dies, we die. Let us come together one last time. Put all the petty differences aside. Black, White, Tall, Small, American, English, Chinese, African, Russian, Indonesian, Brazilian, Mexican, Swiss, German, Australian, French, Gay, Straight, Bisexual, Poor or Rich&#8230; These all make no difference. All of the above are human. People need to learn that they can get along with out fighting. There are worse things in the world than being different to somebody. 
Please, take a moment to decide, is it really worth it?? Is it really necessary?? Put it all on hold and think about what really matters. We must pull together one last time to save her, or else there will be nothing left.
