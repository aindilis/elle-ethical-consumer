  <description>From the National Blood Data Resource Center, a startling number of 38,000 units are needed on any given day. Yet less than 5% of the eligible population gives blood on a regular basis. 

Almost everyone has been touched by a tragedy, even if it was that of a loved one. It's hard to find someone unaffected by cancer, necessary surgeries, or even accidents. Helping people cope wtih these situations means counting on the blood supply to be at an adequate level. It's a grave reality, however, when you look at how critically low the supply is on a regular basis.

Giving blood is equitable to being a hero. It takes a half hour to hour of your time, and you can do it up to 6 times a year! How much easier does it get than that to save a life?

Do it for yourself or for a loved one... and do it for life. =)
