  <description>Children cannot take care of themselves, and they have no power to influence change.  By supporting Susie Flynn, you are making the statement that we cannot stand by and wait for government to act.  This Cause will help bring awareness to the nine million children without health insurance in this country.

1. More than nine million children in the United States&#8212;one in nine&#8212;have no health insurance coverage. 

2. Every 46 seconds, another baby is born uninsured. 

3. It costs less to provide health insurance coverage to children than to any other group of people. </description>
