  <description>Camp Adventure is a one-week get away camp for young cancer survivors and their siblings. Located on beautiful Shelter Island NY, and run by the American Cancer Society, this is a truly wonderful place for these kids to be. I know this very well being a former camper and 4 year cancer survivor. The experiences and memories at Camp Adventure are ones to cherish for a lifetime.

1. The battle against cancer is a difficult one. To have a place for children who have battled this horrible disease is truly special.

2. Cancer is one of the world's most deadly diseases, one that can tear families and lives apart.</description>
