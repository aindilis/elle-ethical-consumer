  <description>We are here to promote independent thinking and allow people to make their own decisions.  People should see to do as they see fit, so long as it does not negatively affect other people.

We promote such things as:

The legalization of most drugs listed illegal under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.

The eradication socially-progressive programs such as welfare, medicare (except for the physically/mentally disabled), medicaid, and social security.  It is understood that all persons are responsible for their own futures, and no governing body shall have the ability to forcefully take monies from one citizen and give to another.

1. Promote independent thinking.

2. Eradicate bastardized bandwagoneer ideas.

3. Allow people do decide and provide for themselves.</description>
