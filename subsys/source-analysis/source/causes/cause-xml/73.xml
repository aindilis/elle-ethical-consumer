  <description>Our cause is to improve America's schools, demand more funding from the federal government and demand that that funding not come with strings attached.  

The inequality in America's public schools is shameful.  We perpetuate a system where those with money are treated better, and end up better off, than those without it.

1. Inequality in America's public schools must end.

2. The federal government needs to provide more money for education.

3. Federal funding should not equal federal control.</description>
