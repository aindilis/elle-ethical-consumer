We all know what the seven wonders of the world are and the Great Wall of China was not included in that list that was made 2000 years ago. Simply because the person who named the seven wonders back then was never aware of the existence of the Great Wall.

2000 years later, the opportunity is here! The New 7 Wonders Group is hosting an online voting for places to be placed into the New Seven Wonders of the World!

The official results will be revealed in Lisbon, Portugal in on July 7th, 2007.

Please do your best to vote the Great Wall of China into its much-deserved place in the New Seven Wonders of the World!
