  <description>The people of the country of Mauritania get their water from the Senegal river, which in their area is infested with a parasite that causes Schistosomiasis. Which causes a chronic illness that results from an infection in the blood which causes debilitation and causes liver and intestinal damage. It is absorbed through the feet. Mercy and Truth Ministry has started a well project to help raise money to build wells for the villages of Mauritania. Fill The Well is hoping to help Mercy and Truth raise money for this cause.
