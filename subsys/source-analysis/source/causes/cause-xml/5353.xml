  <description>      i started this cause as a personal quest to discover why i am faithful and try to relay my ideas with whoever cares about them.
      part of this cause is about faith as a general concept and it doesnt matter what cult or religion you follow as long as you are ready to explore WHY you are following it. whether it is islam, christianity, jeudism, buddhism, aesthetic beleifs, scientology...etc. whatever. it doesnt matter what you follow. only, do you really have a reason for following it? is there a deep philosophy behind your faith? or did you just follow the religion of your society? or did the sound of that religion just appeal to you
      another part is a more specific one about islam in particular and the -o! soooo many- debates that it carries.
     please notice that this group is not about 


1. to understand faith

2. to be able to communicate between faiths

3. to understand the philosophical implications behind the teachings of islam

4. to spread the true understanding of faith in general and islamic religion in particular by any means possible</description>
