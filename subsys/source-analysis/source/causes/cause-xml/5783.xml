  <description>For those of you who know me, you know my adorable and loving brother Matt, who is Autistic.  So to honor my brother I am walking in Autism Speaks Walk for Autism Research in Detroit this Fall.  The Walk for Autism Research is the signature fundraising event of Autism Speaks and is the nation's largest Walk program dedicated to Autism research. 
Please join Team Matt!


The SE Michigan Walk is on Sunday Sept. 30th, in Detroit, please join me in this walk if possible.  If you attend the walk you will get a free t-shirt from Team Matt.  Otherwise if you donate 5$ you get a Team Matt Bracelet, and if you donate 10$ or more you get a Team Matt T-shirt.    To join in the walk, click the link below and sign up.
