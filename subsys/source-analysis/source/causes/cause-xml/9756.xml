  <description>There are a few things that are coming up I know I and others will need many strong and positive prayers.  I also know that I personally need to get back on the path of praying and meditating.  

This is more of a group thing, but the cause is going to be for each individual person, as well as us a whole.  We all need to take a little time each day, quite the mind and the heart and listen to what is going on in our heart.  Listen for God, because there is a lot being told to you.  It doesn't matter what religion or beliefs you may have.  I firmly believe that when more than one person prays for another, or a cause, it becomes more powerful.

I hope you join me in this group and cause.

Be well.
