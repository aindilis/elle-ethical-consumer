  <description>I regret to tell you all the sad news
that i have to find homes for my two minous, Loki and
Keisha...and i need your help.
They are both 3 years old and are in great
health..Loki is a purebread Himalayan male..he is
beautiful..fun and loves to play...he's a good
cuddler..and he is the cutest cat you will ever
see...Keisha is a mixed female...and the MOST
affectionate cat in the world..she loves to be around
people and would be most happy in a home with lots of
people to pet and cuddle her. She is beautiful and can
cheer you up with her purring if you're ever down. She
saved me with her affection. Both Keisha and Loki are
neutered, and Keisha has her front claws taken out.
They are both very tolerant to being groomed...It
kills me to do this as i love them both very much and
need to make sure that they go to good homes, so if
you or anyone you know are a cat lover and feel that
you could help them out, it would be infinately
appreciated. I can't, and won't bring them to the
SPCA, and will do what it takes to find them homes. 
Please forward this to all the cat loving people
you know..

If you have any questions, please give me a call
anytime...514 806 6644

Thanks
