  <description>The Pregnancy Help Center of Milwaukee, Inc. is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization.  Over the past twenty years, we have expanded into two locations in the Milwaukee area.  Currently, each location sees approximately 150 women a month.  All of our services are free to the community and we are available to refer women and families for additional assistance.  

At the PHC we provide FREE pregnancy tests and have confidential and compassionate one-on-one mentoring, free clothes and diapers, educational classes, and telephone counseling available 24 hours a day.  You can find our staff and volunteers at local community fairs and other events where we try to bring our services right to our deserving mothers and children
