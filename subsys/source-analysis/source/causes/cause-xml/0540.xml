So why shouldn't our voice be just as powerful as theirs?This is a bi-partisan group aimed toward empowering young people to get out and not only vote, but to make their voices heard in any way. That could mean protests, blogging, or passing out fliers. Anything you can do to make even the smallest amount of a difference. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and be part of the change.
