  <description>The iTest is an IRS 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which creates and administers academic competitions all over the United States.

We open educational doors to students that otherwise would never be able to participate in academic competitions.  We help level the educational playing field in the United States, so more and more students can take action to improve their own educations even in high school.

Help us spread the word about The iTest!  Invite your Facebook friends to our cause!  Make a donation!  Tell everyone about us!

Thank you!!!!

Bradley Metrock, President
Dave Cowart, Chief Operations Officer
John Hart, VP Operations

(Note: The name of the non-profit within the IRS' records is "American High School Internet Mathematics Competition" ... but it's still The iTest.)




1. Every US student should have equal access to academic competition.

2. This access should come at no cost to students, educators, or schools.

3. Corporations and private foundations should bear this cost, and they do.  But individuals can help.  Contributing even a dollar helps support The iTest's educational mission.</description>
