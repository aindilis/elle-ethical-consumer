  <description>      Genocide has been happening since the begining of time. Genocide is when a particular group of people tries to eradicate another group of people. Some examples of this are:
hitler in 1939
Israel now
darfur now
rwanda 1994
The United States only interferes if they will benifit from it. Shouldn't we try to stop it without expecting reward? This is the reason why this cause has been formed. To stop theses crimes against humanity.

1. All countries committing genocide must be FORCED to stop

2. Each country must sign a plan denouncing genocide

3. Have the UN inspect each country every 5 years for genocide</description>
