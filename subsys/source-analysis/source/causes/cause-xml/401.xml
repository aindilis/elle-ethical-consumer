  <description>Want to Make a Difference by Supporting STLF?
Your support can be an investment in the life of a young person. The best part is, students are living commitments to service and 'paying it forward' in their own lives, schools, communities, and families. Here's how your support can help:

    * $45 - Breakfast for 40 students on a Pay It Forward Tour.
    * $140 - Dinner for 40 students on a Tour.
    * $280 - Full Need-based Scholarship for a student on a High School PIF Tour.
    * $425 - Full Need-based Scholarship for a student on a College PIF Tour.
    * $7,500 - Full High School PIF Tour (5 Days) for up to 35 under-resourced High School Students from several Alternative Schools in Minneapolis and St. Paul.
