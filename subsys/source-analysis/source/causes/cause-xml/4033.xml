  <description>This description is from www.klove.com, where I "heard" about this cause:

"Today is the day to make a difference!

Your gift will help people in Africa affected by HIV and AIDS receive hope through treatment, resources, and support. Children orphaned by AIDs will be cared for - and most importantly, they&#8217;ll have the good news of Jesus and the salvation message shared with them. 

Your gift of $62 will positively impact an AIDS-affected community for one week."


ONE WEEK ! that's a big deal. you can easily spend that on a couple of shirts at the mall, or on a date... this is your chance to give back and have it really mean something. you could save a LIFE. and, what you give is going to come back to you. that's just karma. :]
