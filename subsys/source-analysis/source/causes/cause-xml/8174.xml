  <description>Whenever I hear/see the news all I hear/see is violence. We never hear many good things. All it is, is death, kidnapping and horrible events that are happening everyday. 

I don't understand why people murder, rape, and kidnap. A person doesn't gain anything from any of this. The only thing that a person can gain from these is a prison sentence. Why do this? Why ruin people's lives or end them. It affects everyone around the events. 

By joining this group, it shows that there are people out there that care. People who don't want violence in their lives or anyone else's. People that care and want to help. We want to show that there are good people out there!

It is really hard to express how I feel. I just know that I want to help somehow! I don't want to feel sad everytime I hear the news. Let's see some good out there folks!

1. Stop the violence (murder, rape, kidnap)

2. Show hope</description>
