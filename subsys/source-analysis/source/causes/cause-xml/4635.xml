  <description>This cause is dedicated to promoting free or reduce-priced university and post-university education for every student accepted to his or her desired institution. Our higher education is greatly over-priced, and therefore too expensive for the majority of the population. Also, the loan companies, which are or are not affiliated with the universities are benefiting on the fact that we want an education, and that by getting a loan is the only way we can afford this. Well, I think it's time we put a stop to this! I think we should urge the goverment to start a fund for everybody to make education, if not free than at least more affordable! America has one of the highest-priced systems of higher education, and one of the most currupt at that. In most other countried it's free to go to college, or not nearly expensive to do so. It is time we make this a trend in America, as well. 
IT'S TIME FOR MORE AFFORDABLE EDUCATION IN THE U.S.A. !!!

1. Affordable eduction for everybody

3. A crack-down on the fraud lending companies</description>
