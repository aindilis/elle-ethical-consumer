  <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of oppression and attacks by the Khartoum regime, the people of Duk Payuel Sudan still needed to walk 75 miles to see a doctor and children continued dying of curable diseases.
&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thanks to the generosity of supporters around the world, a clinic was built and opened in May 2007.

&lt;/p&gt;
