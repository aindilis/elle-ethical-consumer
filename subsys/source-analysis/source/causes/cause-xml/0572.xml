  <description>"If slaughterhouses had glass walls, everyone would be a vegetarian."
(Paul and Linda McCartney)

The mission of PAW is to encourage harmonious existance between animals and humans by introducing and maintaining products and groups which support environmental sustainability,sensible agriculture and community welfare and education. This isn't a group entirely dedicated to vegetarianism, veganism, or any kind of religious beliefs. It is purely to protect the fragile relationship between animals and humans to provide for a more peaceful and healthier world. 

Austin is home to thousands of animal lovers. I believe that this community can help provide a better home and environment for the animals we have here, and those being threatened elsewhere. 

1. An animal's pain, suffering and sadness is equal to that of humans and should be treated as such

2. Animals are reliable, many full of love, true in their affections, predictable in their actions 

3. We will not condone or promote violence as a way to acheive our goal of peaceful existance amongst species</description>
