  <description>Advocates for the Underdog is an Ontario-based coalition.

Founders Natalie Kemeny and Tammy Williams have saved over 240 pitbulls since the Windsor pitbull ban went into effect September 27, 2004. Over 300 Windsor pitbulls have been destroyed in the same period.

AFTU has witnessed first-hand the suffering of pitbulls and their owners that has resulted from this pointless legislation. Now that the Ontario Liberal Government&#8217;s breed ban is in effect AFTU estimates that over 5,000 &#8220;pit bulls&#8221; will die. AFTU needs your support. Please donate to the Legal Challenge.

2. Breed specific legislation and breed bans are not effective solutions to the problem of dog attacks.

3. Education for proper compliance is key for responsible dog Ownership.</description>
