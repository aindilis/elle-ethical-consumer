  <description>As a part of the AIDS generation it is our responsibilty to take a stand and fight against this devastating epidemic. AIDS kills one person every eight seconds and has left 22 million people dead. Currently 42 million people are living with the disease. AIDS is not just an African disease, it is a disease of the world. As a part of today's youth, we must unite with a sentiment of human compassion and make a change! 

1. AIDS is a worldwide crisis

2. Every person deserves the right to be educated about AIDS

3. Every person deserves the simple medical technology required to prevent AIDS

4. If not controlled, AIDS has the potential to devastate our entire generation </description>
