  <description>Antidote International is devoted to spreading awareness about major world issues among today's teens. We&#8217;ve focused our events on a plethora of unresolved issues, ranging from the child soldiers in Uganda to the genocide in Darfur to the status of women. We strive to create an environment in which students can learn more about what's being done and what they can personally do in order to aid these issues. To top it all off, we do it while having fun! Through rock concerts, hunger banquets, trips to Mexico, Antidote International always manages to ignite a passion for change. 

1. Create awareness campaigns on current world issues. 

2. Promote the work of various Non-Profit Organizations and to educate students on the extent of their work.  

3. Fundraise for these various organizations.

4. Inspire a devotion for change in the future leaders of tomorrow.</description>
