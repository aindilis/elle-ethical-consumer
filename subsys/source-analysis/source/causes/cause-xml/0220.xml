  <description>Please join this cause if you believe in equal rights, including the right to marry, for LGBTQ persons, and if you believe in stopping discrimination. 

If each of us makes a commitment to spread awareness of discrimination, and bring an end to it, in our community, the word will spread, and our voices will be strong. 

So whether you are a lesbian, gay, trans-gendered, questioning, or straight, if you believe in the cause, then join it. Make a difference. Every voice counts. 

1. LGBTQ peoples have the same rights as straight people.

2. Derogatory terms are hurtful, and should be avoided. </description>
