  <description>Recently the NMPA has dramatically decreased the amount of free musical documentation found on the internet.  This group is here to eliminate wrongful limitation of musical documentation, and to bring the music back to the people.

1. The NMPA must change their policies on the limitation of tablature and other musical documentation.

2. Tablature should be allowed to the people of America without charge.

3. In no way does tablature help people steal from artists, but it rather helps spread the influence of the artist's work to a much more real level for other musicians everywhere.</description>
