  <description>This has gone far enough we are here to start a revolution, or shall i say revive the truth in people's thoughts. Our generation is strong, capable, and more than willing to do what it takes in life to accomplish the things we need to! This is going out to every single person on myspace in the world, we are here to promote well being and absolution, it's time we take a stand to end the "War on Terror". One way our organization is gearing up to achieve this is goal is to open the world's eyes through music, and the sounds of the youth. We are going to have a benefit concert, which gives ordinary bands like YOU a chance to get noticed and to support an amazing cause. We want any and everyone to join this cause because it is for yourself, and for your country. Do not support George W. Bush, he is manipulative, and very persuasive in his teachings, he delivers truth beneath lies. He has dragged this on long enough and has said he would not back down until he is out of office. It is time to find another way. If you are a supporter please write back to the person who as posted this blog for more information on how you can help put an end to the "War on Terror"

1. The war is never ending!

2. Bush is all about Anarchy

3. Our troops deserve our help</description>
