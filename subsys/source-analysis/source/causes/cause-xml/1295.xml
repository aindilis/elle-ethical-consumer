  <description>The Circle Sanctuary was founded in 1974 by The Rev. Selena Fox and Jim Alan, Circle's first public event was a Yule ritual hosted at the couple's home in Madison, Wisconsin.

Today, with approximately 15,000 subscribers, it aims to encourage community celebrations, spiritual healing, research, networking and education.

A pioneer in civil rights for Wiccans and other Pagans, the Circle Sanctuary has been a prominent figure in the recognition of Wicca as an accepted religious practice, including the acceptance of the Pentacle as a religious symbol for use on Government-issue headstones and other grave markers for United States service members.
