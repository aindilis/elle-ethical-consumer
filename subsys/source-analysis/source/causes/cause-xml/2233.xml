  <description>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder that causes a decrease in production of collagen or the production of poor quality collagen, which leads to fragile bones.  These fragile bones break much more more easily than they should.  The severity of the disease varies between cases.

There are about 20,000 to 50,000 cases of OI in the United States.

As the mission states, the OIF supports research, education, and awareness for OI in order to better the quality of life of those affected.

1. OI must be researched in order to be better understood and to better the quality of life of those battling the disease.

2. Doctors must be educated about OI, because many cases are first misdiagnosed as child abuse.

3. Better treatment options must be found.

4. Eventually, a cure MUST be found!</description>
