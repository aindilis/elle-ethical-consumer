  <description>The Governor's Scholars Program is a life-changing experience that receives funding from the state of Kentucky (thanks to the legislature and those lobbying in favor of the program) and private donors as well.

The KYGSP spans 25 years, and has positively impacted the lives of thousands of Scholars, as well as many communities in the state of Kentucky.

GSP is a program in which scholars learn that change in our homes, and in our state is possible, and that the power of even one concerned person is enough to invoke change.

*This group is not officially sanctioned by the Governor's Scholars Program.  This group is designed to encourage support and donations for the program.

1. GSP is a life-changing experience that must be fostered for future scholars.</description>
