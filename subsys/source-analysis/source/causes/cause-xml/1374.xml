  <description>"I might not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it" ~ Voltaire

Although it is said Voltaire only went so far as to apply this ideal to the intellectuals of his time, it is essential that we apply it to all people. It is imperitave that we allow all voices and opinions to be heard. Not shouting over each other or supressing voices althogether, but a forum where even odd or extreme ideas are heard.

Change has not been brought by the safe, the mundane; change has been brought by the different, the radical. We must continually keep an open mind, promote conversation, and reevaluate our opinions. Only through that can our society continue towards an everbetter hopeful future.

1. Conversation and Debate must be promoted.

2. Although disagreement is expected understanding and respect must be adhered to.

3. Keeping an open mind is a must.</description>
