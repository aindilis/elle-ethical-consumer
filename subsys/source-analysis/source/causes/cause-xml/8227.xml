  <description>Many tortoises are packed in crates under TERRIBLE conditions and sent around the globe.
If you must have a tortoise, buy captive-bred ones! Do not purchase wild-caught tortoises!  This only encourages "dealers" to steal more from the wild.

NOTE:  The Russian Tortoises in the picture were found in a crate full of maggots, with many of the torts suffering fractured shells, crushed skulls, and severed limbs.  Many tortoises die this way.

If you dont care about the tortoises, think about the effect on you:

Please help stop this destructive practice.
