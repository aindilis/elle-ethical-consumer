  <description>Save the Manatee Club was established in 1981 by former Florida Governor and U.S. Senator Bob Graham and singer/songwriter Jimmy Buffett. The Club was started so the public could participate in conservation efforts to save endangered manatees from extinction. Our mission is to protect manatees and their aquatic habitats for future generations.
