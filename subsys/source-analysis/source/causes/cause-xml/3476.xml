  <description>The Hebrew Home of Greater Washington, a Charles E. Smith Life Community, is the largest not-for-profit long-term care facility in the Mid-Atlantic, serving more than 500 seniors on a daily basis.  Located in Rockville, Maryland, the Hebrew Home has served the community for 97 years.  We depend on community support in order to continue to provide life-enriching programs and activities for our residents in an atmosphere that "feels like home."  

1. We should honor the eldest members of our society.

2. We have an obligation to care for those who cared for us.</description>
  <mission>Our mission is to care for the elderly members of the Washington, D.C. community.</mission>
