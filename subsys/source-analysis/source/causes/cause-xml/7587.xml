  <description>We are First Nations Ministries and we believe in reaching Native Americans for Christ by all means. Our "in your life" philosophy of ministry, modeled after Jesus Christ, means that we spend a lot of time with our Native brothers and sisters providing for their physical needs as well as their spiritual.

1. Faith in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the Living God, Creator of all.

2. Jesus the Christ died on a cross as payment for our sins after living a sin-free life only to be raised to life again by God in Heaven.

3. The Bible is the complete, infalible and inspired Word of God.

4. It is our job as stated in Matthew 28:19 to "go into all the world making disciples of ALL nations" by "all means" as stated in I Cor. 9:22.</description>
