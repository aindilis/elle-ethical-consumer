  <description>The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism (&#8220;the RAC&#8221;) is the Washington, DC, office of the Union for Reform Judaism (Union). The RAC has been the hub of Jewish social justice and legislative activity in the nation&#8217;s capital for more than 40 years. The RAC educates and mobilizes the American Jewish community on legislative and social concerns, advocating on issues from economic justice to civil rights to religious liberty to Israel.

The RAC&#8217;s work is mandated by the Union for Reform Judaism, whose 900+ congregations across North America include 1.5 million Reform Jews, and the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), whose membership includes more than 1,800 Reform rabbis. Representatives of these two organizations, as well as the Union&#8217;s affiliates, comprise the Commission on Social Action (CSA) and govern the RAC&#8217;s policy positions.
