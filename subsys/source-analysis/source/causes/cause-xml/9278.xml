  <description>Many youth are exploited and abused through a practice known as Door to Door Sales, or Traveling Youth Crews. In these situations, employers work youth by having them sell candy, household goods, etc., either door to door or at locations such as shopping malls. These employers, in most cases, claim to be not for profit organizations. Yet they earn considerable amounts from the items youth are selling. Youth are encouraged to work in these areas with promises of prizes and trips. This does not include charitable, school or church organizations such as Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts.

There are many dangers for youth involved in these operations. Youth are worked beyond the allowed hours at night. They work in areas far from their own homes, sometimes across state lines. They are left on street corners if they have not met their sales quotas. Youth have been pulled inside peoples' homes against their wills. Twenty or thirty youth, both boys and girls, are piled together in motel rooms for overnight trips. Lack of supervision leaves these children vulnerable to any kind of night activity.

1. Youth Crews should be regulated by law

2. Support Child Saftey Organizations

3. Support the International Initiative to End Child Labor - Worldwide

4. Support Malinda&#8217;s Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act-SB-251

5. Better Business Bureau should protect these "individual contractors"</description>
