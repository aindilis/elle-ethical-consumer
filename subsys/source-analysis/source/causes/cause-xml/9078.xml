1. Guide dogs greatly enhance the lives of their blind handlers - providing independence, empowerment, and love.  

2. Our mission is only made possible through a large network of volunteers; these people are  truly the heart and soul of the organization. 

3. It costs over $45K to breed, raise, train, and match a Guiding Eyes dog with its blind handler, yet the dogs are provided entirely free of charge.</description>
