  <description>Just Think teaches young people to lead healthy, responsible, independent lives in a culture highly impacted by media. We develop and deliver cutting-edge curricula and innovative programs that build skills in critical thinking and creative media production.

Just Think has reached nearly 7,000 students, teachers, parents and others through direct programs, more than 30,000 individuals through screenings, exhibits, fairs, and other community events, and an additional 3,600,000 lives through unique media touches.

Just Think concentrates our efforts in two primary areas:

* Producing innovative media arts and technology       curricula that ignite young minds and encourage critical thinking

* Delivering exciting in-school and after-school programs that teach essential media literacy concepts and vital media arts and technology skills to youth and their caring adults.

Just Think targets under-resourced populations from low-income communities. Our programs are designed for students of ages 8 to 18; educational institutions serving youth; and teachers, community leaders, and parents. Of the hundreds of students who completed our core media education programs in the United States, 35% were African American, 25% Latino, 20% Asian American, 10% Caucasian, and 10% other ethnic groups.
