  <description>Eugene lived on the street. He was trying to get where he was going, and no one would help him. He needed $11 for a bus ticket to Memphis. He had a job waiting for him and was frustrated that everyone treated him like a bum. I gave him the money, including my "lucky" $2 bill. I hope it brought him some luck. 

As I watched him get on the bus, something snapped in me. There are other Eugenes out there. They not only need our help, but we need theirs. They teach us to care.

The Eugene Campaign is a giving program designed to radically affect the life of at least one needy person per month. $11 can change more lives than you know - including your own. We can care more, do more, and be more. Change starts with the individual.

1. To love the poor, we must know the poor.

2. There's more to compassion than just charity.

3. Change starts with the individual.</description>
