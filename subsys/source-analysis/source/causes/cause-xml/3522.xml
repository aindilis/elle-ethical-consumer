  <description>Canticle is a volunteer organization comprised of classical musicians who wish to use their gifts and talents to reach out to the community.  We serve senior centers, long-term and transitional care facilities, hospitals, and Covenant Hospice in Pensacola and surrounding areas.

Scientific research has shown positive impacts of music upon the health of the listener, and we have seen the benefits of live music firsthand.  It can lift the spirit and reduce stress.  Maybe most importantly, live music offers human interaction and fellowship between the musicians and the listener.

Sometimes our music is used as entertainment.  Sometimes it is there to simply create a much-needed atmosphere of calm and peace.  In all cases, we place high, professional standards on the music we present to others.  All settings are different.  Because most of our members play more than one instrument, Canticle is able to constantly transform to best fit the different needs of our community.

1. Live music has a positive impact upon the health of its listeners, and is especially beneficial in a clinical setting.</description>
