  <description>here's the current problem: vegetarians don't like to eat meat, and they don't like other people to eat meat either.  so i have come up with a solution to make everybody happy. here it is: the people who originally ate the cows should now eat the vegetarians.  now we get our meat and the vegetarians can't say we are eating the cows... thus everybody's wish is granted

1. vegetarians must be silenced

2. i don't care, as long as i can eat meat</description>
