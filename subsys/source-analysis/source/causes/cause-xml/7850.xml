  <description>The mission of B.Y.O.B. is to raise awareness of the four main components of literacy: Reading, Writing, Talking, and Listening. We will have books of the week every Monday. Having books of the week will help with getting people involved, as well as, provide an opportunity for everybody to discuss via wall posts what they have read and would like to read in the future.
