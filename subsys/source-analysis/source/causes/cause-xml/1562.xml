  <description>The Weekend to End Breast Cancer is one of inspiration and hope benifiting the Alberta Cancer Foundation. Our team, the Bodacious Bouncin' Boobie Babes, consists of Kayla Bilsoborrow, Nadine Degroot, Shannon Kinsella, Vicky Kinsella and Cecilia Davies. We are walking 60km over two days (August 11-12) to show our support for those affected with breast cancer. Each person walking must raise $2000 for the cause, which adds up to $10, 000 just for our team! For more information, or to donate go to www.endcancer.ca. Don't donate from this page!!!!

To show additional support, we are hosting a BBQ at Greenland Garden Center in Sherwood Park on June 9 and 10.
