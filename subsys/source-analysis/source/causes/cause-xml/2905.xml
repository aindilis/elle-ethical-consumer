  <description>AAASP is an organization dedicated to providing children with physical disabilities the opportunity to experience firsthand the thrill of teamwork and share in the spirit of competition. As an AAASP/Muscogee Lions alum, I can attest to the impact of the program on my life. The coaches and players are a wonderful group and like a second family. I learned so many lessons on and off the court that will help me in the future. 

I will be taking certification courses to become an AAASP official and coach in the near future. 

1. Children with disabilities are just like everyone else, and should be treated as such

2. Sports can provide a positive social and physical outlet, and expose the children to new things </description>
