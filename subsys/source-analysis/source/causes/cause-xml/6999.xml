  <description>Barretstown is a magical camp in Ireland, part of the hole in wall association, which provides breaks for children and their families who live daily with the stress of a serious illness such as cancer or Leukemia. Barretstown allows them to forget about illness and allows them to just be children again, trying everthing from canoeing and horse riding to pottery. 
The camp is a charity and runs because of donations of money and supplies from all corners of the globe and relies on volunteers to help run sessions!
