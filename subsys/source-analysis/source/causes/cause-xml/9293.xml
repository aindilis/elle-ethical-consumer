    Deep Vein Thrombosis is a life-threatening condition that kills more people per year than breast cancer and aids combined.  Deep Vein Thrombosis occurs when there is a clot in the deep part of the leg, usually thigh or upper calf.
      Many complications are associated with Deep Vein Thrombosis such as an pulmonary embolism or stroke.  This condition is silent and can occur in individuals who are pre-disposed genetically, individuals who have cancer, those who must stay seated or crouched for an extensive period of time, and those females who have miscarriages due to an anti-phospholipid membrane.
       Some of you may remember David Bloom a newscaster whom was covering news in Iraq until he was diagnosed with DVT and later died.
