  <description>With the new Facebook Causes application, young alumni and friends of Seton Hall Prep may contribute to The Prep's mission more conveniently than ever before.  

Implemented by Project Agape and supported by Justgive.org, Causes allows you to make a secure, tax deductible donation to the Seton Hall Prep Annual Appeal.  

Annual Appeal funds are used for general operating expenses to keep the school running day to day.  With tuition at $10,100 and a per-pupil cost of $12,200, the Annual Appeal closes the gap and essentially affords every student a $2,100 scholarship.

Separate endowment funds support academic scholarships, physical plant maintenance, and expansion of current facilities.

Your gifts, no matter their size, help provide the tools our students need to succeed here at the Prep and beyond.  If you have any questions or would like to keep in touch, please contact Kyle Benn '02, Director of Alumni Services:
