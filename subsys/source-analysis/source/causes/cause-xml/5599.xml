  <description>Rebecca is in the running to get her own public radio show through PRX's American Idol-like Public Radio Talent Quest contest. She's now in the top 5 and would like her buddies to vote her into the next round. If she makes it to the end of the competition, she will get to develop a show for public radio, which will in all likelihood be based on science, skepticism, and an all-around rational look at life. 

You can help by signing up on the contest web site and voting for her! Voting's now open for Round 4. Just log on and vote here:

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

And be sure to listen to the other great contestants, too. They're all very talented and deserve some support!

Also, feel sorry for Rebecca because she's started talking about herself in the third person.

Also also, she had to choose a nonprofit from the list to receive money, even though she's not asking for money she's asking for votes, so she chose the JREF. Why not?

1. Rebecca needs to win her own radio show.

2. Science rocks!</description>
