  <description>Once in many decades are we given the opportunity to witness true greatness.  Kobe Bryant has redefined greatness, but yet he fails to receive the credit he deserves.

First he was the "second" man and everyone gave the credit to Shaq.  Then when he took over as leader of the Lakers people started calling him selfish.  Now when he's surrounded by talent the critics say he doesn't shoot enough.  Are we going to criticize greatness and diminish it by failing to accept?  

Despite constant criticism Kobe showed just in fact why he's surreal.  Instead of fade in the pressure he has risen and his Lakers are western conference number 1 seed.

Those same critics who once hailed Kobe as selfish and arrogant are not voting for him  for the 2007-2008 MVP.  So who's left laughing now?  

1. Win the 2007-2008 NBA Championship

2. Re-sign Kobe so he retires as a Laker

3. Keep irritating the Haters until they become "bangwagon" fans and join us.  

4. Dunk on Shaq before he retires

5. Earn 7 rings before he retires</description>
