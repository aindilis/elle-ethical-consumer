  <description>my cell phone fell in the toilet today =/

urine got on it, not just mine either because the toilet wasn't flushed, so i had to clean it too.  it's not sanitary anymore.

if you see me at school, please feel  free to donate 1$, although i don't think i'll get any donations lol.

i put that nonprofit organization because i thought the title matched my situation, so i don't think you can donate via website/facebook if u wanted to...though i don't think anyone would want to.

thanks in advance for looking
