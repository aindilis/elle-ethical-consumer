  <description>The Central Asia Institute works to establish schools for children in the Middle East.  They mandate in all areas where they open schools that families must send the girls to school as well as the boys.  This promotes education for young women in the Middle East region where opportunities like this are few.

The CAI also runs a project called "Pennies for Peace" for children.  You can visit their website at www.penniesforpeace.org.  If you work with small children, it is a great opportunity to teach children how they can change the lives of the children around them.

To find out more about the man who started the Central Asia Institute, read his book "Three Cups of Tea."  He's an amazing man, and his organization does amazing things.  Or visit the website www.ikat.org.

The title of the book comes from an Afghani saying "It takes three cups of tea to know a person: First cup you're a stranger; second cup, a friend; by the third, family."
