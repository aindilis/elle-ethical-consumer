  <description>My grandpa went to a doctor for 5 years because he had back problems all the time. Well thats at least what they told him... the truth was that he had cancer in his bones and it was spreading fast.... they knew he had it but decided not to say anything when they could have saved him.... also when he was in the hospital they screwed up the medicine that he got somebody else got his and he got somebody elses.... the other person died... my grandpa may have died from that but he sure did die later....I started this cause because RUSH does not have it togather at all.... also my grandpa waited 2 hours in a emergency room.... is that the great care we need?? 

1. RUSH will renew all their hospitals that have damage.

2. Great care should always be givin no matter what.

3. RUSH needs to fire some employees and fast!</description>
