  <description>I've had my dreads for 7 years now, but in the last 2 years my parents have had cancer 3 times between them. It's because of cancer research foundations that they are still alive, so if anyone wants to help by pitching in whatever they can, even a buck or two, that would be awesome.

The haircut comes on Saturday June 16th 2007. Pictures and updates will be added.
