  <description>Voice the Silent is a forum I had created a while back, and thought I would make a group on FB under the same name.

Voice the Silent's goal is just as the title says.  To give the silent and innocent animals a voice.

I volunteer at a shelter, and I see it everyday ... animals who come there out of carelessness of humans.  People just throwing them away because they don't want them anymore.  When you bring an animal into your home, you need to provide that animal with love and caring.

On an international level, animals are being maimed and killed in the name of fashion and entertainment.  Through circuses, rodeos, runs with the bull, seal hunts, fur trades, etc.  Animals are discarded and neglected and abused.  These animals need a voice.

1. In suffering, we are all equals.

2. To voice the silent.

3. To help animals locally and internationally.</description>
