  <description>Plug Out, Plug In is an infant project, currently on hold but able to become active at any point, to educate students in all school levels about the realities of global warming. It asks students to unplug appliances they usually have plugged in, and then calculates the pounds of carbon they did not emit. Students then learn about global warming and climate change, and also see that they can make a difference with the most simplest of changes.

In the future, we might have the option of donating to POPI if you are interested in that. If you would like to be involved with POPI, please view the corresponding Facebook group (http://hs.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2248676843) or the website (http://www.geocities.com/plugingreen/).

Thank you for support and keep (un)plugging away!

1. Education is the first step towards action.

2. Everyone is able to make a difference.

3. Smalls steps taken now will build up and lead to cascading changes in the future, helping the environment and slowing global warming.</description>
