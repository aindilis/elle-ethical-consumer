  <description>I'M RUNNING TO SAVE THE WORLD LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!  Perhaps just attempting to do what I can to help out this fab world of ours then.  I'm raising the cash to help save the lives and as my friends you have no choice in being heroes too!!!

1. DONATE TO THE CAUSE-JUST GIVE UP THE CASH, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE SUFFERING IF YOU'RE FACEBOOKING

2. WEAR PROTECTION AND KEEP THINGS FROM SPREADING-IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE RISKING SPREADING IT TO YOUR FRIENDS

3. TALK TALK TALK! ABOUT THE CAUSE, THE TRUTH, AND THE ABILITY TO HELP

1. Anyone can help and all help is needed

2. We will win this fight, no matter how long it takes to find the cure

3. You can prevent the spread by staying protected and spreading the word</description>
