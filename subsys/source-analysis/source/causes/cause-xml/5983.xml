  <description>We all need Something Corporate back in our lives. Andrew is officially turning gay with Jack's and I can't take it. And when I say Something Corporate, I mean William Tell involved. Andrew will always be everyone's Konstantine.

1. Andrew is turning gay from being in Jack's Mannequin.

2. Brian's new band only plays small bars and won't come to Virginia Beach.

3. Something Corporate is just the best band ever and they need to get back together.</description>
