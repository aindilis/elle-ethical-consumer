  <description>Poor Baileys embarassing underbite causes many problems for her on a daily basis. She is a very misunderstood soul as her underbite sometimes makes her look more vicious than she is. Poor Bailey has a kind heart and would never hurt anyone (unless they are a squirrel or a magpie). She is deeply embarrased each time she drinks water as it goes all over the place and makes her look messy. She also has to endure relentless ridicule from other dogs in her class. Poor Baileys lifelong dream is simply to be able to smile, which is virtually impossible for her.

1. Dog braces are expensive

2. Dogs deserve affordable orthodontic care.

3. Dogs are also embarrased by dental problems</description>
