  <description>Our organization&#8217;s primary activity is visiting with and distributing toys to hospitalized children. Our visits occur throughout the year, although the majority of our visits are during the December holidays. In addition to hospitals, our members visit children&#8217;s shelters, orphanages, halfway houses, and other facilities with needy children. Every year we visit thousands of children.  The visits are done by airline crew members (current and retired), Corporate pilots, private pilots, and aviation enthusiasts.
