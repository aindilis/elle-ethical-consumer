  <description>This facebook cause was created to commemorate my late dog, Penny. All of the proceeds will go to the Nevada Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, a local Las Vegas shelter that works to rescue and provide care for animals.

The Nevada Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) operates a no-kill animal sanctuary, promotes humane education, makes referrals for lower-cost spay/neuter and vaccination services to the public, and challenges people to be the best possible guardians for the companion animals in their care.

1. Every animal has the right to exist.

2. Individuals should protect said right, be it through donation, volunteerism, or any other positive course of action.</description>
