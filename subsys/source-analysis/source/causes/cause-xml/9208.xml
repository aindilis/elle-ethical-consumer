  <description>The TARIAG Association allows anyone to support Israeli Non-Profit Organizations thanks to donations.
On IsraHelp.com, there is a directory of NPOs and you can select the one you want to support and the sum you want to donate. Moreover you can support several NPOs at once thanks to the E-commerce cart concept.

1. Anyone must be able to support Israel independently on their current country and get tax exemption.

2. 100% of the donations should get to their recipient

3. The donors should be able to keep their privacy and donate anonymously if they want to donate whenever they want and not when they are contacted and incited to do so.</description>
