They're kept in dirty cages and spend their lives in those cages. By buying dogs from pet stores that sell them or buy supplies at stores that sell puppies you are supporting this terrible thing. Join me by going to the website above and sign a pledge to say you'll do your part. Please I know so many of us have a dog or dogs and how would you feel if they were getting this kind of treatment? HELP THE ONE"S WHO CAN"T HELP THEMSELVES!!!

1. This treatment of puppies must end now

2. Stop buying from pet stores that sell dogs

3. Save these kind, beautiful, funny animals that we love</description>
