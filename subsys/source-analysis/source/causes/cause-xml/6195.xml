  <description>Everytime a chicken crosses a road they risk being mocked and having insolent humans cracking jokes about them.  (eg. Why did the chicken cross the road?  To get to the other side.)  This blatant disregard for the rights of poultry must STOP. 

1. Chickens must have improved rights.

2. The stupid chicken jokes MUST end.

3. There may only be one reason why the chicken crossed the road and that is their own bussiness.</description>
