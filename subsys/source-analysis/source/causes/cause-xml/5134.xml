  <description>Regular Tigers are in some parts of the world, but they are not endangared species, but white tigers are not, they are being killed for their fur and soon they are not going to be a part of the world.
Anthoer problem that is making white tigers disapear is deforestation, the forest and rainforests are being destroyed. White Tigers have the right to live as well as other animals, and even if us Humans have to protect them, it is a risk we have to take to save them. By doing this, many people will realize that this is neccesary and will do that with other animals such Polar Bears. So please pay attention to our environemnt, because in a few years, many animals will be gone forever.... thats right forever.. =(

PLEASE help by inviting all your friends!
