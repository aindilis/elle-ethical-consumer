  <description>Donner Summit is an area in tahoe by Serene Lakes which is being bought by Foster Farms to be developed into real estate.  This is one more reason our country is going downhill this is a truly beautiful area and soon will be nothing but strip malls and condos for the rich completely ruining the rugged natural beauty of the area.  We need to preserve the natural beauty available in so many places much more aggressively than we currently are and this is a great place to start.
