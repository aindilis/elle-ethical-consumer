  <description>Pretend that the Holcaust is still occuring. Would you be okay with one of the genocide's funders hosting the Olympics?

A Holocaust IS occuring in Darfur, Sudan. 400,000 people have been killed, and many raped, tortured, and chased from their homes. China buys over 2/3 of Sudan's oil, supplies it with weapons, and is the host of the 2008 Olympics. 

Join the many that believe that China should stop funding the Janjaweed, a militia group responsible for carrying out the first genocide of this millenium. Demand that before China should host the Olympic Games, they request Sudan allows the UN Peacekeepers in and refuse to supply them with money. Write to Olympic Sponsors and ask them to join your cause, to pressure China to pressure Sudan. Get educated on what is occuring and spread awareness.
