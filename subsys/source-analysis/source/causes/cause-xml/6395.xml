  <description>Every day, thousands of innocent South Africans are affected the violent crime that has swamped our country. 

Instead of deploying our security forces to protect the masses, our fat cat politicians prefer to utilise our much needed security resources in revenue generating, speed trapping exercises. 

Each month millions of rands are removed from the open market economy and diverted in government coffers, this as a direct result of unnecessary speed trapping. 

This means that money that would be spent on growing our economy through purchases at various businesses are now being diverted to the government. How can our economy grow if the Government is hoarding its citizens money? No wonder poverty and crime is at an all time high.

Please join us to fight for the South Africa we believe in. The South Africa that protects its citizens interests. Be part of this campaign. Restore "The South Africa I Believe In." Start now by signing the pledge!




 

1. Speed trapping for revenue generating purposes MUST end!

2. All revenue generated from Speed Trapping must go towards driver and road safety education and initiatives

3. We demand and Open, honest, accountable Government!

4. Advance government reforms that make people and ideas more important than money!</description>
