  <description>In 1947, Jesse and Bertha Fleck founded Cherry Street Mission Ministries to provide free soup, soap, salvation, and shelter from the elements to people in need. In the years since, Cherry Street has continued to shelter, feed, clothe, and share the Gospel with the homeless and severely poor who seek our help. Now the largest homeless shelter serving northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan, Cherry Street helps more than 400 people every day who are homeless and severely poor, more than all other shelters in our region combined. Our mission is to serve all who come to us in need, and to provide purposeful discipleship by rescuing the downtrodden, restoring hope to the hopeless, and releasing God's greatness to those we serve. Our vision is to transform lives by empowering people to advance from dependency to self-sufficiency.

1. Cherry Street&#8217;s emergency shelters are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year...  we never close and never turn anyone away. 

2. Cherry Street provides free food and clothing to men, women and children via our Gifts-in-Kinds and Clothes Closet

3. Residents in our shelters are provided clothing, meals and personal hygiene products free of charge and may stay as long as they need.

4. We are the only shelter in Northwest Ohio and Southeast Michigan that serves 3 meals a day, 7 days a week.</description>
