  <description>Bill Richardson, the current governor of New Mexico, is easily one of the smartest and, in my opinion, the best and most able person in the race. As a master negotiator and one of most brilliant analytical minds we have seen in a long time, I feel that this man clearly should win the upcoming election. This man, the former US ambassador to the UN, and a former U.S. Representative, is so good at international politics that he has been called upon while the governor of New Mexico, to settle international conflicts in North Korea, Iraq and Cuba. Because of all he has done, he has been nominated four times for the Nobel Peace Prize. So. please, inform others of this amazing man who will help our country numerous ways if elected.

1. Inform others of Bill Richardson and his views.

2. Build support for Richardson in his race.

3. Help him get nominated for Democratic Candidate and then the presidential election. </description>
