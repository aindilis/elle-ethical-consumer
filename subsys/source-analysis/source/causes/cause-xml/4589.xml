  <description>Many people are out there yelling and complaing about Global Warming, a horrible phenomenon brought on by the world's people.  Because yes, despite the fact that the Earth goes through natural cycles in terms of the temperature and more of the world, it's all our fault that now it's becoming warmer.  Well, there's no real evidence that people are doing it, just speculation.  And if they are, who cares?  Let's get a couple degrees warmer, I need to work on my tan!

Let's all join hands because together we can make global warming a reality.  Together, we can make a difference!

1. Global Warming, if it exists, is not a direct result of humans

2. The world goes through natural climate cycles

3. Global Warming would be nice, I like sitting by the pool!

4. Pirates beat Ninjas any day</description>
