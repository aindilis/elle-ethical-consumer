  <description>Did you know that you if took all the homeless youth in America and put them in one city, that city would be the seventh largest in our Nation?  Surprising, huh?

StandUp for Kids was founded in 1990 by a retired U.S. Navy Officer, who saw the growing needs of homeless youth, specifically in San Diego County.  After several years, the Foundation spread its mission nationwide, with over 40 facilities in over 30 states!  Consisting of a volunteer force of over 1 million individuals across the country, StandUp for Kids is dedicated to helping homeless and street kids on a survival basis. 

In one month alone, StandUp for Kids' San Diego Center provided over 2,500 hot meals and 2,000 warm showers for homeless youth.  Along with hot meals, the Center also sponsors Street Outreach Programs, weekly trips to clinics, continuing education, and apartment support.. all for free! 

No one at the Center gets paid. Donations and funds go directly into purchasing food, sleeping bags, clothing, and paying utility bills in order to keep our Center running for as long as it can.
