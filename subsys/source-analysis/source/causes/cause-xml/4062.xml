  <description>Rob Langille is suffering. Every day that he cannot buy a hockey card off of eBay, or get a box of hockey cards, he hurts inside.

Until he gets back to work, his hockey card collection has been brought to a stand still. 

What can you do, you ask?

Give Rob money, or hockey cards. Steal, buy, rob, or donate hockey cards or cash to this fund, and we will be sure to get those hockey cards into Rob's collection in no time!

One hockey card CAN make a difference. Now, it's your turn...will you make a difference?

1. Hockey cards are Rob's life essence.

2. Rob should have more hockey cards.

3. Hockey cards are fun.</description>
