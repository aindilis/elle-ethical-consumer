  <description>My brother showed me this site called tv-links.co.uk and it has every show, movie, cartoon and documentary on it. So I got into watching these documentaries and it had one on it called "Money is Debt" and it is the perfect start up video to show you how the banks are stealing money from the working class people like ourselves. Many probably don't think this is important or don't find it interesting so you can go on and watch some music videos or something on youtube, but this affects us all. THE WORLD BANK IS LOANING OUT MONEY THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST AND CHARGING US INTEREST ON IT!!! What the fuck is that! Thats not fair, and all of us are going to have to fall into their scheme eventually; it is what runs the economy. AND WHY I HAVE TO PAY THEM $1.50 TO TAKE OUT MY OWN DAMN MONEY!?! Well for now Im just encouraging the movement for knowledge and awareness in our society BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE IS AWARE OF THIS CONSPIRACY FOR THEY DONT TEACH US "WHERE MONEY COMES FROM" IN SCHOOL BECAUSE ITS "NOT IMPORTANT" RIGHT? SO TO FIGHT FOR THIS WE ALL MUST BE EDUCATED ABOUT IT ON SOME TYPE OF LEVEL For those that didn't know this it is time to know that is why i am advertising its awareness So much things are being conspiricized around us and involving us WE NEED to be aware so go find out where your money is really coming from...NOWHERE CUZ IT DONT REALLY EXIST; MONEY IS DEBT

1. Money is Debt must be bannished

2. Awareness is key for growth and revolution

3. Interest rates should not be charged</description>
