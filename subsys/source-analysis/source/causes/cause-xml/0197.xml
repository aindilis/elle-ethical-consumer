  <description>Gays and lesbians are barred from the rights, privileges and responsibilities of marriage in the United States. The Right is constantly harping on "family values," but our families are repeatedly dismissed and denigrated. Same-sex couples should be accorded the same rights and recognition as heterosexual couples.

1. Same-sex couples have relationships that are equally valid and valuable when compared to straight couples.

2. It is incumbent upon the State to recognize committed couples with the rights and privileges called "marriage."

3. Marriage, therefore, should be equally available to all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation.</description>
