  <description>Before humanity, before Earth, before the universe... there was Joe Doyle!  Joe Doyle is the creator of all things and for the past 20 years He has walked the earth disguised as a mere mortal in order to more closely observe his creations.  But now He is displeased!  The creatures of this world bow down to false gods and corrupt politicians, something that He will change.  But before all of humanity can be brought to heel Joe Doyle must raise an army.  He proclaims that those mortals who join him willingly shall be rewarded beyond their wildest dreams!  So join Him now, while you can lest you, your family, and all of your loved ones be swept away and destroyed in the coming conflict!

Glory to Joe Doyle, your Rightful Lord and Master!
