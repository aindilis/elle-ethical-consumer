  <description>One day a long time ago, Jamie Cormack made the horrific mistake of deciding to leave us behind to attend 'uni' down unda. It took her about two hours after she got off the plane to realize she had acted like a total plug and is now dying slowly, counting down the seconds until she is rescued, and only YOU can help bring her back... 

1. She does nothing. EVER.

2. She sits in her room, and then goes to class. (Who would have guessed??)

3. She is forced to talk to roaring douche bags all day</description>
