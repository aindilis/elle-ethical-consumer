  <description>Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of childhood blindness in the world. Each year, 350,000 children are permanently blinded by Vitamin A deficiency. According to the World Health Organization, nearly half of these children will die in the next 24 months. 
One annual dose of vitamin A, costing just 60 cents including distribution is enough to prevent a child from becoming vitamin A deficient. 

1. Lost vision means a lost future.

2. We must do everything we can to prevent blindness in children.</description>
