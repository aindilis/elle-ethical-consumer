  <description>Students with learning disabilities CAN achieve higher education, such as and not limited to: technical school, nursing, teaching, fine arts, and much more! 

It is also our goal to educate students and their parents about the different scholarships and programs available that financially support students with learning disabilities. 

Everyone has a right to an education and we want to help people realize this!
