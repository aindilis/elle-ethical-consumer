  <description>At-risk youth and young adults are a major issue in the subcultures the world over.  As such, Shadow of the Cross, Inc has begun work among them.  Currently we are taking food, water, and bibles out to the homeless, at-risk, and subcultures, and spend time praying and talking with them.

Shadow of the Cross, Inc. is a not-for-profit Christian Sub-culture Alliance founded for the purpose of spreading the Gospel.  We seek to minimize the misconceptions about the sub-cultures and about Christianity.  We are establishing gatherings for friendship and Bible study.  In UK and Indonesia, Safe Houses are established as shelters and training centers for our sub-culture brothers and sisters who are in great need.
 
The ministry is funded by donations from generous people.  All funds go directly towards reaching the sub-cultures and keeping the ministry running.
 
Each branch of Shadow of the Cross, Inc. is linked in vision, outreach, and faith, but we stand as seperate financial organizations, to better abide by the laws of our said countries.

1. We must reach out to our youth and young adults on the edge now.</description>
