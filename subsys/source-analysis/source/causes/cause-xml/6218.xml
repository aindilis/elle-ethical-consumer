  <description>Dihydrogen monoxide is (also known as hydroxyl acid) is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and kills uncounted thousands of people every year. Most of these deaths are caused by accidental inhalation of DHMO, but the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide do not end there. Symptoms of DHMO ingestion can include excessive sweating and urination, and possibly a bloated feeling, nausea, vomiting and body electrolyte imbalance.

Dihydrogen monoxide:

  &#8226; is the major component of acid rain.
  &#8226; contributes to the "greenhouse effect."
  &#8226; has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients
  &#8226; can cause severe burns when in a gaseous form
  &#8226; etc.

Some uses of DHMO include:

  &#8226; the production of Styrofoam
  &#8226; in pesticide production and distribution
  &#8226; in the development of genetically engineering crops and animals
  &#8226; as a byproduct of hydrocarbon combustion in furnaces and air conditioning compressor operation
  &#8226; as a preservative for some produce


The American government has refused to ban the production, distribution, or use of this damaging chemical due to its "importance to the economic health of this nation."
