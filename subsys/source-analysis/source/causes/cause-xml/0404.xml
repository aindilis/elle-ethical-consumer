  <description>More than 1,000 people die each year in the United States because of long QT syndrome - frequently because they simply didn't know they had it.

Long QT syndrome is a congenital heart disease that causes a disturbance of the electrical system. Like the name suggests, it causes the distance between the Q and T waves of the heart to be too far apart. This can often cause ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation is essentially a quivering instead of beating of the heart.

LQTS awareness started becoming greater in the 1980s. People now still have often never heard of this mysterious killer. 

Symptoms of LQTS include:
-Fainting, particularly when scared, excited, surprised, stressed or during physical activity.
-Unexplained death of one or more family members, especially if they were otherwise healthy.

Diagnosis of long QT is as simple as an ECG (electrocardiogram). However, it is key that the ECG be read by a qualified cardiologist or electrophysiologist, not just a computer.

1. More needs to be done to spread awareness of Long QT.

2. People who do have LQTS need to be diagnosed so they can get proper treatment.</description>
