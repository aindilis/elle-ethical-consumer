  <description>The Chinese government is currently holding one of the leaders of the Tibetan religion, the Panchen Lama. The Panchen Lama's duty is to help find the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama after he dies. Now whether or not you believe in reincarnation or not, you can see how this will affect the Tibetan religion after the current Dalai Lama passes on. The Chinese have only to say the Panchen Lama (whom they say is currently being schooled at an undisclosed location for his own safety) told them who the next Dalai Lama is, thus giving them control over the Tibetan people indefinitely. This must be stopped, the Tibetans must have their leader back, and it must happen now!

1. Governments have a right to be autonomous.

2. Abduction of anyone is wrong.

3. Peaceful governments deserve the most support.</description>
