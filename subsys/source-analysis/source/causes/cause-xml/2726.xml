  <description>In a world where our air quality is further lowered one day at a time, and where nostalgia for the old times pulls at our heartstrings and hearkens us back to another era, why shouldn't we do the really easy thing to help the envrionment?

Converting to energy efficient is easy, I know that. Its what I do for a living. But liberating ourselves from the clothes dryers, if only for some things can do just as much. Plus, clothing hung outdoors in the summertime smells nice, gets us outside, enrouages the destruction of nasty dust mites and is a easy step to energy conservation.

So, step up and join the cause. It costs nothing, and it requires only a big piece of string and two wheels, plus a little elbow grease.
