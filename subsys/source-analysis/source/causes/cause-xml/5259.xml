  <description>I need you all to donate your hard earned cash so i can go out on the town more, with every ten pounds donated you will recieve a personalised photograph and a certificate to say that you have adopted a part of a scotsman. Plus if i am out more the likely hood of me abusing your facebook will be less...win win for all!
