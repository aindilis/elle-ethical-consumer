  <description>College classes irrelevant to students' majors should not be mandatory.

1. Some so-called "core" classes will never prove relevant to many students.

2. A student's time is precious.

3. A student's money is precious.

4. Besides social skills, few people find anything that they learn in high school useful later in life.</description>
  <mission>Our political objective is to have lifted requirements that mandate that students take any class irrelevant to their futures.</mission>
