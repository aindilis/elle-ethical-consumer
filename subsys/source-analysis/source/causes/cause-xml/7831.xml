  <description>"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity"

Today we are facing a hard fact, that is, an innocent Muslim child is being sent to a madrasa to learn Islamic studies, but the enemies of Humanity mislead him towards suicide and prepare him to die and kill. Which is against Islamic belief!!!!

We need to eradicate brainwashing and extremism from Pakistan, so that the people of Pakistan can live free, in peace and without oppression.

People should be free to practice any religion they want without being oppressed, even if you disagree with their beliefs.

This truly is the characteristics of a great nation!

"You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place or worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the State." - Jinnah (One of the greatest men ever lived)

1. Terrorism must end in Pakistan

2. Love and Live in peace with your fellow Pakistani

3. Change through Education and support</description>
