  <description>Children with a parent in prison number an estimated 1.5 to 2 million; of those, 125,000 have a mother in prison. Only recently have children of incarcerated parents begun to gain attention as a special population with unique needs. When a parent is arrested and incarcerated, children suffer in a number of ways, according to research reported by the Federal Resource Center for Children of Prisoners. After the initial trauma of seeing a parent handcuffed, taken away, and put behind bars, the child must cope with the grief associated with a parent&#8217;s absence. Economic loss causes additional strain on the family and may have a negative effect on the caregiver&#8217;s ability to meet the child&#8217;s needs. Responsible mentoring can be a potent form of support for children who are struggling to cope with the effects of a troubled home life. Research shows that mentoring increases the likelihood of regular school attendance and academic achievement. It also decreases the chances that a child will engage in self-destructive or violent behavior. A trusting relationship with a caring adult can provide stability and have a life-changing effect on the child.
