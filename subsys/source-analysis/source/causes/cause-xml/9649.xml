  <description>Let's face it, the church tries to bring their bigotted morals into everything and it's being far overdone.

1. The Church hates everyone despite the whole "love thy neighbor" bit.

2. Attempts to convert are almost always oppressive.

3. The words "I'm a Christian" can evidently be used as justification for everything, including rape and murder.</description>
