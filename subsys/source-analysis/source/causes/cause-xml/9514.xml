  <description>if you have muddy shoes, you don't just go and walk on the carpet, cuz if you haven't noticed, the mud gets on the carpet!!
so the way to solve all that is to buy brown colored carpet :)

1. doormats should be placed infront of all doors

2. don't walk in with muddy shoes! duh..

3. the brown colored carpet must be the same brown color as mud, or else the purpose wouldn't work to its full extent..</description>
