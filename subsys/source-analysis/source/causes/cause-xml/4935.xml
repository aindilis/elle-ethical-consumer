  <description>Under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, we see that "No person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law." We turn to our esteemed Department of Justice, to enforce these rights for us, along with the Judicial Branch. These are essential, as de Touqueville says, to preventing the "tyranny of the majority." 
Yet, we find that the administration has turned this department into a political wing: firing U.S. Attorneys for political reasons, shifting from civil rights cases to cases of religious bias, hiring conservative appointees and immigration judges while judging candidates by ideology, not competence. 

Furthermore, we see that the Department of Justice seeks to undermine our civil liberties, warrentlessly wire-tapping phones and searching through bank accounts. Yet the Fourth Amendment protects us from "unreasonable searches and seizures."

Return our Department of Justice to its rightful position an enforcer of the rights of American citizens. "Liberty and Justice for all."

Note: This is just to raise awareness, but any profits generated will go to the ACLU.

1. The Department of Justice is fundemental for protecting our liberties, which make this country great.

2. The Department of Justice should not be used for political gain by either party, but rather to ensure justice for all.

3. The Department of Justice should serve to protect our liberties, not to erode them.</description>
