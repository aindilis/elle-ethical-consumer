  <description>Ultimate has been around since the 1960's. Its popularity is immense and growing rapidly. It embodies the spirit of fair play and sportsmanship.


"Ultimate relies upon a spirit of sportsmanship which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect between players, adherence to the agreed upon rules of the game, or the basic joy of play. "

Not to mention, this sport is pretty friggin awesome.
