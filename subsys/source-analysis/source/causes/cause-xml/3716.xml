  <description>ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now)

Organized into neighborhood chapters in 104 U.S. cities, Canada and South America, 350,000 ACORN members stand united to build stronger neighborhoods and a more just society. In the United States, our members are continuing the fight to raise the minimum wage, enact mandatory sick days, Earned Income Tax Credits and help with the cost of child care - issues that make up the ACORN Working Families Agenda.

In New Orleans, ACORN's Home Clean-out Project has organized volunteers to gut and clean more than 2,000 homes damaged by Hurricane Katrina so residents can return.

We are also organizing internationally, where our members are focused on affordable housing and safe neighborhoods, environmental justice and worker rights.
