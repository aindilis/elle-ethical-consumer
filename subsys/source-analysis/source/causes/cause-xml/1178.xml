  <description>I joined Interact Club of Yala, as a pass time after my graduation from High School. During this time, I met quite a few friends, who were really active in social service and public relations. as International service director, Disebh, proposed a project to sponsor education for two children of AIDS victim. This project was actually initiated by the ROTARY club of Yala. As, a branch club, we had been trying to raise some fund for this. So please give what you can.
