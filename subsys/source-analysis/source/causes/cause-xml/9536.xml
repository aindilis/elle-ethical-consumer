  <description>We are a cause started from one amazing program (NSLC) and this is our community service project.

We are planning on doing the following
1. Creating flyers to spread awareness
2. Free showings of the film "An Inconvenient Truth" to spread awareness of global warming and alternative energy.
3. Create donation boxes to support non profit organizations supporting our cause.
4. Have fund raisers and sponsors to raise money to make this all happen.

If you have any thoughts or concerns please feel free to email me or post a comment here. We need all the help we can get. Thank you!
