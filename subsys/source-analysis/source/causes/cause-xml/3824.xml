  <description>Missions. The visual arts. They just don't seem to go together, do they? For more than 8 years now I've been trying to find formal opportunities for visual artists to serve in missions, short or long-term.

Since I began this search, a few movements and organizations mixing mission work and the tactile arts have popped up. Perhaps the one with the most potential at this point is OM's Arts Link (http://omartslink.org). Presently, the Arts Link program is limited to short term trips for visual artists, working alongside long-term OM people abroad. 

Arts Link's vision is broader than just short term trips, however. Long term workers are part of the vision, as well as a "compound" in Atlanta with space for a gallery, studios and apartments to house artists of faith interested in using their gifts  to fulfill the Great Commission. 

Let's encourage the people working in Arts Link with our words, prayers and dollars!

1. The Church must relearn the importance of the arts in the context of incarnational and missional living.

2. The arts are important to every aspect of life.</description>
