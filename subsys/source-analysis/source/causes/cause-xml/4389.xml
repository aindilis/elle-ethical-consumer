  <description>Well, as you all know, there are many rural areas in the cities of America. like many other people i dont think its right. unlike alot of people tho, im trying to do something about it. I believe that poverty can be abolished from this country if people from 1st class worlds stand up and do something. This cause that i am starting on Facebook is just one little step to doing that. If we abolish poverty here, we can really give good lives to people who deserve it.
