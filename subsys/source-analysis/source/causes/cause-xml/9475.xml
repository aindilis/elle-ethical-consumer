  <description>We must learn to respect people's faith instead of constantly trying to convert them. Believe what you'd like--to whatever extent that you'd like--in your own home, in your own church, with your own family, but don't you dare think of bringing it into public or social functions.

We must stop making snap judgments based on what we think other people should believe, or what we've come to learn about their beliefs. It is our right and freedom to believe how we want, and it's highly immoral of us to tamper with those rights. 


1. Allow people to live their lives the way that they see fit.

2. Create a more open-minded America

3. Learn to enjoy life whilst a mutual respect exists.</description>
