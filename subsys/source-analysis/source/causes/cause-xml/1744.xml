  <description>Student/Farmworker Alliance (SFA) is a national network of students and youth organizing in direct partnership and solidarity with farmworkers to eliminate sweatshop conditions and modern-day slavery in the fields. We understand our work as part of a worldwide "movement of movements" for economic, social and ecological justice. We organize closely with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a membership-led community organization in SW Florida comprised largely of Latino, Haitian, and Mayan Indian immigrants working in agricultural and other low-wage jobs throughout the state
