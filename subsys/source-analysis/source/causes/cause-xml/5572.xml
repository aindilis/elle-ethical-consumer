  <description>Well, all you have to do is write generic letters to the kids. The age groups range anywhere from about age 3 to teenagers. Just talk about your pets or your last vacation and as them about theirs as well. Usually I include small toys like a bouncy ball or coloring pages, and so I tell them that I hope they like what I got them. Don't mention for them to get better or ask how they're doing, the point is to keep their minds off of their illness. At the end of the letter, make sure you write "If you want to write back to me, please see your child care specialist." Sometimes they'll write back to you or draw you something. Then, put the letter and the toy into an envelope and on the outside with a sticky note, write an age group that it would go to and if it should go to a boy or a girl. Try not to seal the envelope, as well, unless the toy will fall out. The letters go to St. Joseph's Children's Hospital, and I take them down there. If anyone wants to donate toys and not write letters, that would be awesome as well.

Just remember, the more creative and the more personal, the better!
