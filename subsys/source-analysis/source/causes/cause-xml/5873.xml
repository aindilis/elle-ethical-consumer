  <description>The Foundation&#8217;s programs focus on two primary areas: historical preservation and education. They work closely with the Writers Guild of America to provide a number of services and programs to both working writers and the public. 

This includes:

* maintaining the Writers Guild Foundation Shavelson-Webb Library, that houses over 15,000 film and television scripts.

* promoting literacy and writing programs in Los Angeles, including school-based writing workshops for at-risk teens, K-12 school programs and school/classroom visits.

* sponsoring educational seminars, panel discussions, screenings, classes and other writer events, including Writers on Writing, Writers on Genre, Spring Storytellers and regular summer craft events.
