  <description>Show your support and join this cause.  There is so much un-discovered talent in the Tri-City area and no place to show it off and make people laugh. This city is so dry with entertainment VENUES and talent shows.  It is time for a change, our city is one of the fastest growing, maybe someone will see this and in dire need, respond and put Kitchener or Waterloo on the map for comedy amateur night at Yuk Yuks... why is Toronto so special? and no one else.

1. No amateur night at Yuk Yuk's in Kitchener must stop!

2. Bring amateur night to Kitchener</description>
