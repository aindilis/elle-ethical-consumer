  <description>If you live in Brookfield, CT you may have noticed that the citizens are ill protected and generally stupid. This is where the militia comes in. We will be the ones patrolling the streets, ready to whip out our stung un/airsoft gun/taser/etc. at the first sign of trouble.

If you join the cause, we ask that you donate to us, and join our group of the same name.

1. Brookfield citizens are stupid.

2. They need to be protected.

3. We will protect them.</description>
