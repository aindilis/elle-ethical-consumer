  <description>Christians for Biblical Equality is a nonprofit organization of Christian men and women who believe that the Bible, properly interpreted, teaches the fundamental equality of men and women of all racial and ethnic groups, all economic classes, and all age groups, based on the teachings of Scriptures such as Galatians 3:28.

Injustice is an abuse of power, taking from others what God has given them: their dignity, their freedom, their resources and even their very lives. CBE also recognizes that prohibiting individuals from exercising their God-given gifts to further his kingdom constitutes injustice in a form that impoverishes the body of Christ and its ministry in the world at large. CBE accepts the call to be part of God&#8217;s mission in opposing injustice as required in Scriptures such as Micah 6:8.

1. We believe the Bible teaches the equality of men and women.

2. We believe God has given each person gifts to be used for the good of the Christ's kingdom.

3. We believe Christians are to develop and exercise their God-given gifts in church, world, and home.

4. We believe the Bible teaches that Christians are to oppose injustice.</description>
