  <description>Lack of self-respect and respect of others has been ignored long enough.  Make a personnal choice to omit degrading terms from your vocabulary.  Make a choice to think positively about all people and use good things and words, not just in public but in the privacy of your own home, family and friends.  Look down upon others using poor language to identify others and themselves.  Its the only way to start the path that leads to the road of World Peace.  Lets join hands in botherhood in saying Bury the "N" Word!

Thank you,
