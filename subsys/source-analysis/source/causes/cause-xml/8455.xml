  <description>This cause is not to raise money, but to ensure that everybody stays patient with his or her server and leaves gratuity at the table after eating at a sit-in restaurant.

1. We are not the only ones in the restaurant and the other customers are receiving the same service as we are.

2. We understand that the larger the group we come with, the longer it is going to take to prepare food and drinks.

3. We know that all servers/waiters/waitresses are humans and do make mistakes.

4. We know that at least a 15% gratuity should be left on the table/on a credit card in order to make up for the rest of minimum wage that most servers don't make. (In Missouri they only make $3.25 an hour).

5. We acknowlege that if there is a mistake with our food, it is not always the server's fault.</description>
