  <description>The People for Pigs Rights Society is a group of people who stand up for the rights of our twirly-tailed, pot-bellied, pig friends. We do not think the consumption or murder of these innocent creatures is humane or right. There is no reason for pigs to die. They've never done anything to anybody, except maybe splash them with mud from their daily mud baths. But they are innocent, cute animals that deserve life more than ANYTHING.

1. Pigs are an important part of society and should not be killed

2. Pigs deserve life, just like any living, breathing, animal

3. It's wrong to eat pigs. How would you like it if someone killed you so they could eat you. </description>
