  <description>Nuclear power, as most things, has the potential to be extremally beneficial to all humanity. However, nuclear power, as most things, has been stripped of that potential goodness, and become a weapon capable of destroying millions of lifes. This cause has been set up in favor of total Nuclear Disarmament. So all those in favor are welcome and asked to join the cause.

EVERYONE is invited to join.
