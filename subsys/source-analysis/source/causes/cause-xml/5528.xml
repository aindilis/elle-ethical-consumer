  <description>Turner Syndrome is a genetic disorder occurring exclusively in females. It results from the absence of one of the X chromosomes, in whole or in part. Even with an estimated 70,000 women and girls living with the condition in the United States alone, Turner Syndrome is relatively obscure to the general public.

The syndrome itself carries numerous health consequences, including short stature and abnormal reproductive development. While many women are successfully leading full lives with Turner Syndrome, others have been less fortunate.

It is important that we raise awareness, promote research and create support for anyone touched by Turner Syndrome.
