  <description>Everyday over thousands of sharks are slaughtered out of greed and ignorance. Either for their fins, or cartilage, or jaws, sharks are being killed off now faster then ever. Sharks CAN NOT cure cancer, or AIDS despite what people say, there is no proof of this and we all know that since sharks are at the top of the food chain, there are not many of them. With long gestation periods, and a long time to mature, plus the few young produced sharks are vulnerable to begin with. They are being killed off faster then they can reproduce. We need to do somethingYOU need to do something, and you can. One person may not have much power, but together we can make a difference, I have seen it done first hand, and I know the power we posses. The following is a list of companies that exploit sharks in cruel and disgusting ways, please help these animals by telling them you disapprove of what they are doing, its a simple task that can have very positive results.

1. Greed and ignorance are not reasons to kill innocent animals.

2. Sharks are very misunderstood animals.

3. The actual shark is being tortured because the people mostly just cut off the fins and leave the shark to bleed to death in the ocean.</description>
