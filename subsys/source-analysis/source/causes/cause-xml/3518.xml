1. "No Kitty Left Behind Act" (Ending Iraq war, stabalizing the region (including Iran), and finding homes for every kitty.

2. 4-point Immigration plan:  Secure border with a fence and national guard (which would be home be this point), send EVERYONE illegal home, streamline immigration process, and declare the idea for a national id card officially 'creepy.'

3. Systematically abolish all insurance companies:  Health, auto, flood, homeowners, life.  Insurance amounts to fear mongering and if these can be destroyed with government control, one by one (health insurance first), it would be the best for the country.

4. Help our farmers with tax cuts and technology

5. Reform education and dissolve the federal department of education, this should be left to the states.

6. Random small tax cut for all classes to keep everyone happy</description>
