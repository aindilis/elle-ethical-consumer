  <description>The Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI) partners with governments and drug manufacturers to make treatment for HIV/AIDS more affordable and to implement national programs to reach patients in need. Today, more than 750,000 people living with HIV/AIDS are on medicines purchased under CHAI agreements. 

CHAI addresses the HIV/AIDS pandemic in several distinct ways. First, we continuously work to reduce the cost of key medicines and medical technologies to make high-quality treatment more affordable. Today, 66 countries have access to our reduced prices. Second, we work hand-in-hand with 25 governments to expand access to treatment on the ground, strengthening management capacity, improving procurement and laboratory systems, training healthcare workers and managing initiatives to expand care to particularly marginalized populations, such as children and people living in rural areas.

We must work together to turn the tide of HIV/AIDS, or it will be impossible for many developing countries to achieve their social and economic development goals &#8211; putting the future of our global community at risk. Through your generous donations, the Clinton Foundation can help turn the tide of the AIDS pandemic and bring quality healthcare to the people in need around the world.
