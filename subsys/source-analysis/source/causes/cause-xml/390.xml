  <description>Active Minds is the nation's only student-based mental health advocacy program on college campuses. Dedicated to eradicating the stigma associated with mental illness, Active Minds members work to promote awareness and understanding of depression, anxiety, eating disorders and other issues on campuses nationwide. We know that mental health issues face thousands of students everyday, and we commit to doing everything we can on campus to bring attention and respect to the cause.

Active Minds was founded in 2001 by twenty year-old Alison Malmon, after the suicide of her only sibling - brother Brian Malmon - who had just taken a leave of absence from college.

Now on over 200 college campuses nationwide, with countless national media and awards (New York Times, CNN, Washington Post, Mental Health America, and  Glamour Magazine) the organization is aiming to develop over 300 chapters in the next year and raise the funds needed to support all student mental health.

1. Increased awareness is key to reducing mental health stigma

2. We all have a story, and we all need to tell it

3. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for college students, killing 1,100/year.  We all have a role to play in reducing that to 0

4. Nearly 1/2 of all students report having felt so depressed in the past year it was difficult to function.  You are not alone, and there is hope!</description>
