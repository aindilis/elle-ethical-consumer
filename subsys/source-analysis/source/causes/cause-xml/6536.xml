  <description>Why are you staring at me? If it was not immediately apparent, i am dancing. yes, DANCING. Well, that happens to be YOUR opinion.

1. As long as a particular dance style, however far-out, is not hurting anyone and isn't impeding on the dance rights of others, it should be performed with the same protections granted to the more 'traditional' dance moves

2. At no point shall one's dancing style be cramped by the thrusting or grinding of unwanted foreign pants bulges or camel toes at or on said person. This behavior will be considered unlawful restraint.

3. No person or administration may hinder the right of multiple dancers to assemble, in a circle or other formation, for the purposes of dancing, as long as it adheres to the aforementioned principles</description>
