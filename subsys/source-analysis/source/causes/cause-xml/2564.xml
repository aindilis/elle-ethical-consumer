  <description>I know there are some Women out there in the military, who are tired of being only able of being an Medic, MP, JAG, Intell Operator, Pilot, Computer Analyist, etc..

Tired of hearing that there are so many bullshit reasons as to why women can't go combative? Why we can't do navy seal or reconn or rangers just as well as any man can do?.

Point is to prove, that we can do anything, if we point our minds to it and we deserve and equal chance for an combative slot. 

So give it to us!!!
One day that bullshit law will change, and when they do, America wake up, a man's wife is worth just as much as a women's. We may give birth to a kid, but guys help create the kid, without the other the race cannot continue. Just see daylight.
