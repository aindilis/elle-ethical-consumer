  <description>Days End Farm Horse Rescue (Days End) is a volunteer based, animal welfare organization established in 1989 to foster compassion and responsibility for horses through intervention, education and outreach. Since its beginning in 1989, Days End has been a place where children and adults have found enrichment, satisfaction, sadness and purpose through helping to provide care for unwanted, abused or neglected horses. Days End has gone from a small non-profit sheltering only a few horses annually, to a full scale and well respected rescue and rehabilitation facility housing on average 50 - 60 horses at any given point in time.
