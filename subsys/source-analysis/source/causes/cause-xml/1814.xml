  <description>Sean's Last Wish Foundation wants to raise awareness to the fact that in the state of South Carolina, hate crimes against individuals with disability or who have a different sexual orientation are not included under the current law.
There are currently 3 amendments before the judiciary committee to change that. It is our goal through Sean&#8217;s Last Wish Foundation to do everything we can to get this changed and these amendments passed.

These amendments are: H3738, S440 and S443; they would assure that all hate crimes regardless of race, religion&#8230;..or sexual orientation would be treated the same and receive a justified sentence.

SC is one of only 3 states left in the United States that does not have this all inclusive hate crime legislation.

Sean has always talked about how every Human Being should have the same right under the law regardless of who and what they stand for. His last wish was to get this changed.

Let&#8217;s stand together and get it changed.
