  <description>Seal Alert-SA releases a movie clip (Movie.wmv), Namibia Seal Cull 2007. My apologies for the long-download, we made the movie clip as short as 
possible (25 seconds), we know you need to see this! It will be loaded on our websites, www.sealalert.org and www.sealalertsa.net and www.seashepherd.org . We ask others to distribute this movie clip freely, show the world, and for someone to please load it on youtube.

Boycott Namibian Tourism and anything Namibian, until this stops. Write to everyone, including Namibian Embassies in your country. The power of one starts with you.
