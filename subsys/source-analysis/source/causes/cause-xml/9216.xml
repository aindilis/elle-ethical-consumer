  <description>How many times have we seen an ambulance stuck in traffic and done nothing to help? How many times have you seen others be arrogant and not let an ambulance pass just because they would have to give up their spot and be one stupid car in front.

By joining this cause you dont have to give money or anything not even your time. All you have to do is take an oath (that too, to yourself) that:
1. You will always let an ambulance pass.
2. You will do all you can to help the ambulance get through traffic.
3. If you are travelling with someone and you come across an ambulance you will request the driver to observe rule 1 &amp; 2.

Please onserve rule 2 &amp; 3 without the use of force or any other means besides a kind request (to obstucting factors/people).

Its not much to ask by joining this cause but it would definately help. All you got to do to feel what i feel; i.e.  imagine one of our loved ones (God forbid) in the ambulance and it being stuck in traffic. And above all you not able to do a thing.

1. You will always let an ambulance pass.

2. You will do all you can to help the ambulance get through traffic.

3. If you are travelling with someone and you come across an ambulance you will request the driver to observe rule 1 &amp; 2.</description>
