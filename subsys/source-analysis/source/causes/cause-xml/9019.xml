  <description>The frontman of Jack's Mannequin(formally of Something Corporate), Andrew McMahon was diagnosed with ALL in June 2005. He is now in remission and doing great. He created this foundation in July 2006 to benefit groups such as the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation and The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. A tour with a few other bands in September/October 2006 brought in between 70 and 90 thousand dollars for this foundation!
