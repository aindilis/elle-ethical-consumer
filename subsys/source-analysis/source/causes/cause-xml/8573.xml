  <description>How many Camaros sit derelict in backyards waiting for the restoration that never comes, being used as a second shed. When will it end? Right now! With your help we can stop the wanton rot of classic Camaros and other old cars and restore them to be set free to roam gloriously on the highways and streets once again.  Help us won't you?

1. All Camaros are worth saving, No matter how far gone.

2. All Camaros are beautiful, even without spoilers and V8's

3. Chicks love Camaros. Fact.</description>
