  <description>To help keeping good artist like Robi &amp; fans like Diana Luz Ortiz alive...Dr&#228;co Rosa (born June 27, 1969), also known as Dr&#228;co Cornelius Rosa (born Robert Edward Rosa Suarez) is a multi-talented artist from Puerto Rico. Among his talents, Rosa has been known as a composer, writer, singer, musician, poet, painter, and actor. Rosa originally garnered fame as a member of boy band Menudo in the 1980s. More recently, he is best known for his solo career and for writing hit songs for fellow artists, among them Ricky Martin, Julio Iglesias and Ednita Nazario.

Rosa received a Latin Grammy Award in 2004 for the video clip of the song "M&#225;s y M&#225;s". In September 2004, Draco took his show to Puerto Rico's new 18,000-capacity Coliseo de Puerto Rico, selling out the venue. A CD/DVD of the event was released on December 6, 2005, titled DRACO Al Natural. He capped 2005 with 7 sold out concerts at Puerto Rico's "Bellas Artes" theatre in the month of September and proceeded to focus on a new Spanish-language album for 2006. The album had some setbacks but already has a title ("Teatro del Absurdo"), a single ("Luchar por Ella") and was released on July 2007.
