  <description>We all need to donate a few bucks now and then to help needy kids around the US. I know you guys are going to clubs and spending $20 to get in, maybe spending $30-$40 on drinks. So what&#8217;s $1 or $2 dollars a week going to do to you? You&#8217;re buying Diesel Jeans Seven Jeans and Affliction Shirts all over $100, so please just take your credit card out of you wallet and donate $1 a week. That&#8217;s only $4 a month. Believe me when I say this.... It really will make you feel a lot better about yourself. 
So donate a couple bucks now and then, so some young little kid that&#8217;s not even getting $5 a week allowance can eat or buy a t-shirt, socks or shoes.
Please send this to all your friends on facebook so we can raise some money for the little kids.
Thank you
