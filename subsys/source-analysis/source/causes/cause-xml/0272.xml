  <description>From the NY times: 
"Africa&#8217;s best universities, the grand institutions that educated a revolutionary generation of nation builders and statesmen, doctors and engineers, writers and intellectuals, are collapsing. It is partly a self-inflicted crisis of mismanagement and neglect, but it is also a result of international development policies that for decades have favored basic education over higher learning even as a population explosion propels more young people than ever toward the already strained institutions. 

The decrepitude is forcing the best and brightest from countries across Africa to seek their education and fortunes abroad and depriving dozens of nations of the homegrown expertise that could lift millions out of poverty. 

The Commission for Africa, a British government research organization, said in a 2005 report that African universities were in a &#8220;state of crisis&#8221; and were failing to produce the professionals desperately needed to develop the poorest continent. Far from being a tool of social mobility, the repository of a nation&#8217;s hopes for the future, Africa&#8217;s universities have instead become warehouses for a generation of young people for whom society has little use and who can expect to be just as poor as their uneducated parents..."
