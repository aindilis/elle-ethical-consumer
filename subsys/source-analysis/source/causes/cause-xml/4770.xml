  <description>We equip schools with teacher trainings, children's assemblies, and unique heart-education curricula in order to bring the principles of "goodheartedness" to the classroom. 

We engage the community through corporate and high school leadership trainings, volunteerism, and sponsorship opportunities.

Through books, seminars and conferences, we encourage parents to work together with their children to develop self-giving respect. Founder Jill Rigby's books "Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World" and "Raising Unselfish Children in a Self-Absorbed World" take a deeper look at these responsibilities.  

1. Educating our children must begin with setting their hearts in the right direction through respect for others

2. Working in the hearts of children today will lead to a better tomorrow

3. "Manners" are an attitude of the heart that is self-giving, not self-serving</description>
