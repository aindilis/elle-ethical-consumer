  <description>On September 11th, 2001, America was attacked by members of Al Qaeda, a fringe Muslim group based IN AFGANISTAN. George Bush, the American President, invaded IRAQ to retaliate, because he is a complete fool. So, in an continuing insult to the 3,000+ victims of the Sept. 11th attacks and completely in defiance of all logic, rational thought, and the majority opinion of his electorate, Bush continues to ignore Al Qaeda in Afganistan while making a bigger and bigger mess out of Iraq. The war in Iraq is now doing nothing but stirring up further hatred for America and is making Al Qaeda a stronger force, not weaker. 

1. America's national soverignity and the blood of the 9/11 victims demands the head of Osama Bin Laden on a silver plate

2. The war in Iraq has drained off resources that should have gone to the war against Al Qaeda in Afganistan after they attacked us

3. Bush is an absolute idiot for attacking Iraq and derelict in his duty for not catching Bin Laden

4. We need to support our troops by not quietly standing by while they get sent into quagmires like Iraq by morons like Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld</description>
