  <description>All I want is to show people how things are in our society, and let them know the reality of what they are contributing to without even knowing and how some people's minds can lead them to do such terrible and scary things to our little friends, the animals.

Everyone's thoughts can be shared as long as they are contributing for the good of animals..anti-animal comments will be deleted for the benefit of every1..thankx and I hope we can come up with some very good alternatives to prevent animal cruelty...=) 


1. Animals are friends, not food.

2. Freedom is a basic right for animals and humans.

3. Animal experimentation is unnecesary</description>
  <mission>To show people that justice is equal for everyone and we have no right to hurt or torture animals.</mission>
