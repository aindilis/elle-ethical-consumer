  <description> There has been a conscientious effort around the United States to raise awareness of extreme poverty in many impoverished nations around the world. While it is an issue that needs to be addressed, we must also not forget our neighbors and fellow citizens in the USA.

 Also known as FAF, Feed American Families is a local cause started in Monmouth County, NJ, with the hopes of promoting it into a statewide, and, eventually, nationwide charity.

 To help further raise awareness of the poverty levels in the United States, Feed American Families is in negotiations with major food brokers to help assist in upcoming hunger drives. There will also be wristbands, t-shirts, and hats available in the near future...

...please tell all your family and friends to join and spread the name Feed American Families. 

 Together, we can all work towards achieving a common goal; to strongly reduce, if not end, extreme poverty in the United States.


1. Respect the rights of impoverished Americans

2. Inform the general public of this cause
