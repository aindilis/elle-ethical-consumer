  <description>Join this cause because you like art, are an artist, are friends with artists, want to buy art for your pretty new apartment, need someone to paint a mural for your daughter's bedroom, or would like to donate your spare change to art supplies instead of ex druggies at the salvation army. 

Basically, lets talk. 

You need something you think an artist can help you with? Are you an artist? Are you poor? Are you rich? Do you just want to help out starving artists? Great, you've come to the right place. 

1. Artists don't have to starve

2. People don't have to have a lack of art in their lives

3. Peanut butter is really good</description>
