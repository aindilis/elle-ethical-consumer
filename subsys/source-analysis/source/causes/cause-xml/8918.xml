  <description>Guatemala is a country of endless beauty...and bitter realities.  One of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, 90% of the rural population have never used textbooks or touched a computer.  Half are illiterate, and those are fortunate enough to attend school receive an average of 4 years of education.  

Cooperative for Education (CoEd) seeks to establish self-sustaining textbook programs and computer centers to ensure that Guatemalan students receive the best education possible.  Through the use of textbooks and computers, they will be able to think critically and analytically, and as they receive an effective education, they will be more likely to attend college and obtain leadership positions in society. Ultimately, the students we educate today will be tomorrow's leaders who bring their country out of poverty.

If you would like to learn more about CoEd and how you can help, please visit CoEd's website: www.coeduc.org.  

*Also, feel free to contact Meredith Deitsch to learn about ways you can help change the lives of Guatemalan children within your own community.
