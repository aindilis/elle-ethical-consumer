  <description>We are united here to bring a new age to the world. 
For thousands of years we have sat infront of fires, worn tones of clothing and paid ridicioulisly high electricity en gas bills just to keep warm. But now we have the technology to change that forever. Imagine a world where every day is spend on a beach, with a cocktail in hand. Where you can go out at night wearing whatever you feel like wearing. 
So spread our cause! Drive a car with a insanely large engine that burns more petrol than northern africa! Fly wherever you want to go! Walk and run only on treadmills! Because if we all work together, we can make the world a nice warm place to live. Don`t just do it for yourself, do it for the future of your kids, dont they deserve a nice summer holiday all year round?
