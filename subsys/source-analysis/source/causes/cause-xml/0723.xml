  <description>keep bananas from going extinct!
bananas are a delicious as well as versatile fruit. a la mode, baked in a cake, nestled in a peanut butter sandwich, or simply eaten alone- this fruit really does it all! the banana truly lends itself to culinary experimentation, creativity, and originality. the unique taste and texture of the banana would be sorely missed in every kitchen. this super fruit with a super taste is also a super source of vital nutrients. however, the banana is not only an important part of any diet,  it's an important resource for many countries. top producers include india, brazil, equador, burundi, colombia, mexico, and thailand. the extinction of the banana would not only be devastating to tastebuds, it would be detrimental to the global economy.
