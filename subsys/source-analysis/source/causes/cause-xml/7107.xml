  <description>I am in the United States Marine Corps. I believe there is not enough support for out trrops who are overseas and i hope to change that. The job that we do is very demanding of our lives and time an i personally believe that we dont get paid enough for what we do nor do we get the appreciation that we should get. I am also collecting any money possible to send over to my unit which is currently touring in IRAQ

1. Whether or not the war is right they are doing there job.

2. Support our troops

3. Freedom is free, Pain is Forever</description>
