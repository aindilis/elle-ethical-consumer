  <description>Football Is A Beautiful Game . Manchester United's Style Of Playing Football Isn't. It Is Just Polluting The Great Game Of Football . This Is Especially Aimed At Those Pathetic Ship-Jumpers ( Those Who Only Support The Teams That Win ) , To Stop Changing Teams And Actually Be Loyal To One Club And One Club Only . For Those Who So Called Claim That They Have Been Supporting Manchester United Before Alex Ferguson Became Manager , You Are Lying . Those Who Claim That They Have Been Supporting Since Eric Cantona , I'll Leave You Alone . Those Who Supported Since The 1999 Treble , You Can Fuck The Hell Off .

1. Christiano Ronaldo Is Fucking Disgusting .

2. Old Trafford Smells Like Piss .

3. 95 % Manchester United Fans Are All Fucking Wankers .

4. Nani's Full Name Is Infact Punani . I Swear .</description>
