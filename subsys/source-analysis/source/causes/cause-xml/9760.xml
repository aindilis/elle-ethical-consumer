  <description>So I was reading an article on this today and it got me riled up, so I figured why not start a cause. Jamaican society is one of the most homophobic in the world, which is compounded by a violent reaction against alternative sexual lifestyles by the mainstream community. There have been numerous examples of hate crimes against homosexuals in the country documented by international organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. This hate is ingrained in the culture and as such these crimes are passively tolerated by law enforcement. First and foremost Jamaica must become a place where it is safe to be an open LGBT individual, then laws that currently deem homosexual acts as illegal need some serious reform. More information can be found at the J-FLAG (Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays) website: http://www.jflag.org/

1. Hate crimes against LGBT people in Jamaica must be stopped.

2. Laws discriminating against LGBT and making homosexual acts illegal must be reformed.

3. LGBT people should be able to live with equal acceptance and rights in Jamaican society as others.</description>
