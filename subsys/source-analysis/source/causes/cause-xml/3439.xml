  <description>The medical profession gives a very bleak outlook for pulmonary fibrosis. And no wonder. They have little to offer in the fight against it that is at all effective. Death in 5 years is the common prognosis. It is indeed a very tough disease and there are no miracle cures or quick fixes. But it doesn't have to be a death sentence. There is hope.  - together we can support research into lung disease and hopefully help sufferers all over the world.

my nan sadly died in march 2006 of this disease. it is a disease that they know little about and at present we are raising funds into more research into this. my dad is currently suffering from this disease and there is at present no cure. 
my aim is to raise awareness and promote fundraising for this cause and the Jessie Roberts breath of life fund which was started by my family after my nans death, it is a registered charity linked to the british lung foundation. please help sufferers of this disease. 

this fund is linked to an american lung disease charity as this is set up by an american site however if you wish to donate to my specific cause  please contact me and i can pass on to you the relavent registered charity numbers ect! i am doing this primarily to raise awareness and will be conducting fund riasing events myself - will keep you all posted on how its going!!
