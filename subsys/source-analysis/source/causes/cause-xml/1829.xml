  <description>In 1993 Sheena Carpenter did not overcome her eating disorder. In response to her death friends and colleagues of her mother created a place that would offer support to people like Sheena. Sheena's place provides a wide range of free programs for people affected by eating disorders, including family and friends.
Sheena's place does not recieve money from the government for it's operational expenses and relies on the generosity of others to keep it running. 

90% of individuals diagnosed with an eating disorder are female and occurs more frequently among teenage and young adult females. There are 70,000 people with eating disorders in Ontario alone.

Some stats on eating disorders
http://www.nedic.ca/knowthefacts/statistics.shtml

1. The current climate where people are more often judged on what they look like rather than who they are needs to change

2. Open your mind and suspend judgement and criticism, realize that an eating disorder is not about vanity but is a coping strategy 

3. People with eating disorders can recover. People who recieve treatment are more likely to do so and Sheena's Place can help to provide that treatment </description>
