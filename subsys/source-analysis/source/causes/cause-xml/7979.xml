  <description>We all know that even though beef, pork, and poultry, are the most prominent meats on the market. However horses are still being slaughtered for uses in dog food and meats, and I imagine other less humane reasons. My objection to such a market is due solely to years of experience with horses. They are animals with much greater capabilities than the others. People used to eat horse meat, and some still do. The goal isn't to save every horse in the world, for example a horse that has an unrepairable injury. We say the humane thing is to put them down. However I strongly believe that horses are worth a lot more than a bullet, but sometimes no better tool is available. This isn't a bleeding heart cause, but I am against large scale slaughter of an animal that can serve a much greater purpose. Any man that shoots or kills a healthy horse for the sake of dog food or glue or just killing, should be buried beside them. 

1. Horses are a purposeful tool even today

2. Glue and dog food can come from other means

3. Balance in easily obtainable in this issue</description>
