  <description>I want people to look at this and not see just another cause, not just another reason. I want people to see a Revolution!!!

I have always wanted to help. And now I feel I have enough brain power and ideas to lift it off. But I would like your help. Support this Cause. Help in the fight. Start a Revolution.

Please Join. And Help me. Help Africa.
