  <description>This is a very interesting topic these days and an exciting yet historically and presently very sad one, too.

People seem to be in a struggle to preserve the moralities and qualities they enjoy and to not be beaten into submission by someone else wanting everyone to make the same mistakes as them, often regarding this.

The culture of a group of people itself is an endangered living part of our society on which we must preserve the quality of rather than be pushy and want to change.

There are many problems in society today and people are usually blaming the source on racism rather than fixing these - bad home life, dirty dwelling, purposeless lives, and the like.

1. There are many problems in the world today and poking at racism is not the answer.

2. The quality of existing, loved cultures must be loved, nourished, and kept up in quality.

3. It is important to let people shine as who they really are, even if it is similar to one's own culture.</description>
