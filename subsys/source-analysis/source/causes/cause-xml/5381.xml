  <description>The best facebook group of all time was ruthlessly and unfairly destroyed on June 23rd because some pissy little bitch got angy. This group is a stand. A stand for everything America stands for. Free speech and Democracy. That Democracy was challenged on June 23rd. This group is for George Washington, Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, every little boy and girl who waves a flag for Freedom. 
GOD BLESS AMERICA and FUCK DARFUR.

1. Bring back fuck Darfur

2. Save freedom of speech

3. Uphold our rights as americans </description>
