  <description>most of us left myspace because of the annoying top 8 thing, and now it's slowly sneaking its way into facebook. stop it before it gets worse! we're allowed to have more than 24 top friends! All of our friends should be top friends!

1. facebook is not myspace

2. all your friends should be top friends

3. we're all better than that</description>
  <mission>remove the top friends and similar applications from facebook</mission>
