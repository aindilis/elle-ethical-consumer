  <description>While the tragedy of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been drawing increased media attention, one the most troubling aspects of it &#8211; the long-term impact on African societies of some 11 million AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa &#8211; has been featured less often.

There are more than 34 million orphans in the region today and some 11 million of them are orphaned by AIDS. Eight out of every 10 children in the world whose parents have died of AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa. During the last decade, the proportion of children who are orphaned as a result of AIDS rose from 3.5% to 32% and will continue to increase exponentially as the disease spreads unchecked. As a result, the disease is in effect making orphans of a whole generation of children, jeopardizing their health, their rights, their well-being and sometimes their very survival, not to mention the overall development prospects of their countries.

1. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission alone is insufficient

2. Antiretroviral drugs must be provided to keep parents alive

3. Current orphans must have access to care and resources to ensure that they do not suffer the same fate as their parents</description>
