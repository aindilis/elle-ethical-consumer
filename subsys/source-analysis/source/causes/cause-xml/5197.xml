  <description>Partners in Health serves in poor countries and does whatever it takes to improve access to primary healthcare. In finding a way to provide care with scarce resources in rural developing countries, Partners in Health has developed an innovative model of care based on teaching communities to support patients at home. We believe that Partners in Health is demonstrating a better model of care that the whole world can learn from, and we will help them expand their efforts, starting in Rwanda.
