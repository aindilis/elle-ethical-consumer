  <description>Unfair trade is responsible for millions of people living in poverty today. The Solution - make trade fair. 

Fair Trade seeks to empower small scale farms and local growers in developing countries, through simply paying them fairly for their goods, and by doing so, giving them a better life. This is not an act of Charity; it's an act of Justice.

Fair trade saves lives. It's as simple as that.

To find out more about Fair Trade, and where your money goes, log on to http://www.fairtrade.org.uk.

*At the moment, donations are disabled, because of contact from the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK. They are working to externally validate the donations procedure, and we will hopefully be able to restore the functionality soon.
