  <description>My 17 year old brother has recently passed away from Acute Hemorrhagic Leukoencephalitis (AHLE/Hurst's disease) and has donated his organs to recipients and his brain and muscle tissue to science to help find a cure. Let his death mean something.

AHLE was discovered and named after Edward Weston Hurst in 1941. It is a rare and usually fatal brain disease which destroys the myelin sheath around nerve endings in the brain. Myelin acts to increase the speed of signals through the brain. When the myelin is destroyed, the conduction of these signals can be lost and the nerve will whither away leading to brain death. They think autoimmune diseases are also involved...they begin attacking a person's own body thinking the body is at fault.

There seems to be a genetic link as my sister was diagnosed with a similar brain disease called Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis at the age of 9 although her version was not as serious and she was treated and survives today at the age of 20.

1. Research is needed to learn more about AHLE.

2. Sparing future families of such a tragic death should be priority.</description>
