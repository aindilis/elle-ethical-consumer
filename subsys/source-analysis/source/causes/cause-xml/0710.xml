1. CHRISTIAN - Underlying all we do is our biblical faith in the living God, who made the world, loves it and entrusts it to the care of human society.

2. CONSERVATION - We carry out research for the conservation and restoration of the natural world and run environmental education programmes for people of all ages.

3. COMMUNITY - Through our commitment to God, each other and the wider creation, we aim to develop good relationships both within the A Rocha family and in our local communities.

4. CROSS-CULTURAL - We draw on the insights and skills of people from diverse cultures, both locally and around the world.

5. COOPERATION - We work in partnership with a wide variety of organisations and individuals who share our concerns for a sustainable world.</description>
