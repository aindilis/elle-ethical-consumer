  <description>This group is to stop the God Hates Fags protesters.  If you haven't been to their website yet, it's godhatesfags.com.  It sickens me to believe people could be so cruel to gay people.  The people who support this go to FUNERALS and protest gay people dying.  They write things like "AIDS is God's Cure for Gays" or "God Hates Fag Enablers"  It absolutely sickens me.  And the even worse thing is these people HUNDREDS and possibly THOUSANDS of different photo galleries where people are protesting Memorial Services, Funerals, Graduations, etc.  If you want to stop it, please join.
