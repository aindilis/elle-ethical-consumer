  <description>It&#8217;s been almost 6 and a half years since we waged war in the Middle East. Now I know it&#8217;s an American War, but let&#8217;s face it &#8211; the war is A World War, because it affects everyone. And even if it doesn't affect you directly, thousands of people are dying and the most that they can ask is that you care about them. 

In Africa we face another war &#8211; one that isn't talked about in the media and isn't even given the right priority. It is the war against Poverty and AIDS. I know everyone has heard of it, but I believe that if we all unite and try to help &#8211;even if we save one life&#8212; it&#8217;s worth it! 

Join the group if you pledge to do one good deed in Africa or just want to discuss the situations mentioned above. There is also going to be a trip to Africa sometime in 2010 and if you are interested in joining the peace team, join as well. 

And if you don't want to join or you aren't interested in these issues, all I ask from you is that you pray everyday for the lives that are lost in Iraq and Africa. And if there is nothing you think you could do, you have read this far and are now aware of these global issues that trouble our times, which is the first step towards a hopeful future&#8230;

1. To work at making povery Extinct and Stop the Spread of Aids

2. To Provide Alternatives to War
