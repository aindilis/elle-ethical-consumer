  <description>Chabad Jewish Student Center @ USC is an integral part of the lives of hundreds of students. Founded in the fall of 2000, the Jewish Student Center offers services, classes, events, Shabbat and holiday meals, guest lectures, trips, and so much more.
No matter a student's level of observance or background, they find a true home away from home at the Chabad House -- a warm and non-judgemental atmosphere where they are welcomed and inspired.
The dedication and true warmth displayed by Chabad @ USC's founders and directors, Rabbi Dov and Runya Wagner, continues to improve the lives of hundreds of people from every walk of the USC Jewish community each and every year.

1. Labels are for shirts, not people.

2. A Jew is a Jew is a Jew.

3. Every Mitzvah (good deed) makes a real difference in this world.

4. Judaism is the birthright of every Jew, and should be available to them with no strings attached.

5. Education is the key to knowledge. And knowledge is the key to meaning.</description>
