  <description>Have you noticed that there is always some story in the news where some idiot has been hurt/killed by an animal?  Read on and it usually turns out that said idiot decided to try to get close to a bear for a photo or left their child to browse through dingo territory.  There is also the so called "dangerous dog" bans popping up every where!  Dogs are animals, not stuffed toys.  Of course they will attack you if you scare them, mistreat them, they have been trained to do so or if they are treated like toys.
Admittedly there are some dogs who may attack even when un-provoked but this is the exception not the rule. 

1. Animals should be respected as animals, not toys

2. Animals rarley attack when unprovoked</description>
