  <description>In Singapore, the government has initiated an annual Yellow Ribbon campaign to promote giving ex-convicts a second chance in society. Typically, a person shows his support for ex-convicts by pinning a yellow ribbon on his shirt during the annual campaign.

The symbol became widely known in civilian life in the 1970s. It was the central theme of the popular song "Tie a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Ole Oak Tree", Written by Irwin Levine and L. Russell Brown and recorded by Tony Orlando and Dawn among many others, as the sign a released convict requested from his wife or lover, to indicate that she would still want him and that he would therefore be welcome to return home. He would be able to see it from the bus driving by their house, and would stay on the bus in the absence of the ribbon. It turned out that he was very welcomed: there were a hundred yellow ribbons.

1. Do not condemn ex-convicts for life.

2. Let them make amends

3. Everyone deserves a second chance.</description>
