  <description>My goal is to bring awareness that strokes do not only occur in adults but also in infants, toddlers &amp; children. Because childhood stroke is relatively uncommon, but steadily on the rise, not many people are educated on the causes or sometimes deadly outcome strokes can have on our little ones we love so dearly.

My bestfriend, Kristian Cunnings, lost his daughter, Hope Cunnings, after she suffered 3 strokes within a week following a simple surgery to correct her leg &amp; foot. Hope was only 2 years old.
&#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829;
If we could have a lifetime wish, 
A dream that would come true, 
We'd pray to God with all our hearts 
for yesterday and you. 
A thousand words can't bring you back; 
We know because we've tried. 
And neither will a million tears, 
We know because we've cried. 
You left behind broken hearts
And happy memories too
We never wanted memories, 
We only wanted you.
&#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829; &#9829;
