  <description>In today's society people have a habit to "jump on bandwagons", i.e. Stop Global Warming, Don't Eat Meat, Down with Bush, ect. Not that there is anything wrong with these views but, the fact is people tend to go along with such things not because they know about them but because they are sheep and will follow the crowd. The idea behind our Organization is to get people to question what they are told and what they believe, not to tell them what to believe.

1. To Encourage The Spead of Knowledge

2. To Encourage Questioning

3. To Encourage Individuality

4. To Stop Fads From Turning Into Legitimate Causes</description>
