  <description>Good samaritans, meet Mikey. In 2003, Mikey disappeared under mysterious circumstances. His exact current whereabouts are unknown, but the FBI has received unconfirmed reports that he currently resides somewhere in the Arizona desert and was last seen flashing eighteen-wheelers on the I-40. His only means of sustenance is whatever amadillos he manages to shoot with the gun he stole from his dad, although his marksmanship is notably poor. The last person to report seeing him, an unidentified Hispanic woman in the Flagstaff area who owns twenty-six (26) cats, told local police she believes he is the second coming of Jesus Christ

We ask the good people of Facebook to open their hearts and chip in to buy Mikey a sandwich, wherever he may be. Why? Well... just look at him. We're only giving him one sandwich, though, like hell we're springing the coin for two

1. To get Mikey elected President of the World Bank

2. To bring peace on earth by getting the whole world to dry hump Mikey for good luck</description>
