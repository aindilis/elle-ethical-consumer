  <description>Millions of families around the world experience hunger every day. Food shortages due to disasters, conflicts and economic collapse lead to malnutrition, disease and death.

Mercy Corps' food programs, whether responding to large-scale emergencies or ongoing poverty, concentrate on those who are most vulnerable - children, the elderly, pregnant women and the homeless.

1. Mercy Corps nutrition programs - whether providing emergency food aid to famine-threatened Niger or helping Nicaraguan coffee farmers diversify their crops - look to go much deeper than simply distributing boxes of grain.

2. Mercy Corps is working to help determined people worldwide build locally sustainable, resilient health and nutrition networks so that communities can cope with crisis - and mothers can provide a healthier future for their young children.</description>
