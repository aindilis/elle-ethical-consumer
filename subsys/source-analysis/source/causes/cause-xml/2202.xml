  <description>Our mission is to eradicate poverty in pakistan, by building self esteem and entrepreneurial drive of the less privileged people of Pakistan.

If we stop thinking of the poor as victims or as a burden and start recognizing them as resilient and creative entrepreneurs and value-conscious consumers, a  whole new world of oppurtunity will open up.

"Give the man a fish, and he eats for a day, teach him how to fish, he eats forever" 

Jaag Jao's mission is to enable the poor to start new businesses, and help them to run those businesses, without the burden of any loans.

1. Charity is not the answer.

2. Poverty is a state of mind.

3. Poverty is about more than a shortfall in income or calorie intake. It is about the denial of opportunities </description>
