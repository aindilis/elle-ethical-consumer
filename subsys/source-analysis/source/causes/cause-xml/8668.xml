  <description>&#8226; Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer
death in the United States.
&#8226; Pancreatic cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer
death among 40-59 year old men.
&#8226; Approximately 37,170 Americans will be diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer this year.
&#8226; There are no early detection methods so the disease is
usually diagnosed in the late state.
&#8226; Men are 20% more likely to develop cancer of the
pancreas than women.
&#8226; African Americans are 40% more likely to develop
pancreatic cancer than Caucasians.
&#8226; Ashkenazi Jews who are carriers of the BRCA2 gene
are at greater risk of developing pancreatic cancer.
&#8226; In 2006, an estimated $66.7 million dollars of the
National Cancer Institute&#8217;s (NCI) cancer research
investment was spent on pancreatic cancer research.
This is just 1% of the NCI&#8217;s $4.8 billion dollar cancer
research budget for 2006.
