  <description>Community Shares is a statewide federation of grassroots organizations which give people the tools to help themselves, their communities, and the environment, locally and across the state of Tennessee.  For over 20 years, Community Shares has been working to make Tennessee a better place to live. Our member groups address the root causes of problems by involving those affected - finding solutions that work - to create a long-lasting foundation for a just and peaceful community.  We believe that all Tennesseans deserve a clean environment, affordable health care, good jobs, and freedom from violence.

1. Tennesseans deserve a clean environment

2. Tennesseans deserve affordable health care.

3. Tennesseans deserve good jobs and freedom from violence.</description>
