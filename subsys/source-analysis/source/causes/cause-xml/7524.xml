  <description>If you have an internet connection, you've probably heard about Ron Paul, a spry 70-year old senator seeking the Republican nomination.  Unfortunately, despite his supporters pasting his name fucking everywhere, he is a crazy man.  Here are choice quotes from the chosen candidate of Stormfront.org and author of an opinion column for the Dixie Daily News:

"The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers."

"The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America, with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance."

"If you have ever been robbed by a black teen-aged male, you know how unbelievably fleet-footed they can be."

"Opinion polls consistently show that only about 5% of blacks have sensible political opinions"

1. a half-crazed preening Randian

2. a staunch egalitarian

3. Ron Paul's the very model of a modern libertarian</description>
