  <description>Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that attacks the upper and lower motor neurones. 

Degeneration of the motor neurones leads to weakness and wasting of muscles, causing increasing loss of mobility in the limbs, and difficulties with speech, swallowing and breathing.

In America MND is known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's Disease
