  <description>There are too many kids who are without homes or parents, families, anything.  They are forced into a situation without fault and need help. i happen to think that Little by little this can stop. kids don't always hold signs on the side of the freeway or have drug habits to support, but they are out there, alone.  
they are really forgotten about because they are often silent and scared. i read an article today that killed me, and it inspired me to at least do this. As a start


my company is also in support of this cause and everyone involoved - that's the best part

1. child abandonment has to end it's killing the future and ruining their futures. </description>
