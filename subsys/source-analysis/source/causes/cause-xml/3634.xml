  <description>Allan is having trouble finding a job. It would appear as though he has NO employable qualities.

Despite this, Allan is really a big fan of music and likes a large number of bands many of which he would like to see live.

Support Allan in his attempt to support awesome music by giving him money...

...please?








(actually it is an actual nonprofit... I couldn't direct the money to my bank account so I chose an actual nonprofit and kept the profile as a joke.)

1. Music is an important aspect of our society

2. Musicians deserve to see their fans.

3. I really need some money...</description>
