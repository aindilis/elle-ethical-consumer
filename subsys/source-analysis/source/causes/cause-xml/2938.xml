  <description>10km Run/ 5km Walk for cancers below the waist. On July 7th, 2007. 

BC Cancer Foundation's Underwear Affair second year in its running! People get dressed 'down' and get active for cancers below the waist. You can choose to run 10k or walk 5k in a race to uncover the cures for cancers like prostate, colon, and ovarian. And, you get to do it in your underwear - something barely there!

You can participate as an individual or as a team and work towards reaching your fundraising goal. 

Proceeds from the Underwear Affair will benefit the BC Cancer Foundation, an independent charitable organization supporting research and care at the BC Cancer Agency. With cancer survival rates better than any other province in Canada, the BC Cancer Agency is a model for cancer care and control around the world. The BC Cancer Agency is leading the way in uncovering cures and putting these cancers behind us.

1. Lift the taboo connected with cancers below the waist
