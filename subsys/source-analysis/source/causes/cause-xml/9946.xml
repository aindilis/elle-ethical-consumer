The Initiative, which is youth driven , aims to rally partners and stakeholders to increase investment and strengthen commitments for preventing HIV infections among Young people, especially among under served youth.


Our plan focuses on advocating for the establishment of (Anti AIDS Clubs), i.e. schoolbased associations that will provide information and services on HIV prevention to students. This model has been first applied in Egypt through caritas then we succeeded to start our pilot phase in year 2006 in five secondary schools and we are advocating for the expansion in the other governorates
