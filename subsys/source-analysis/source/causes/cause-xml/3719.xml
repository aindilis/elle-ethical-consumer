  <description>Everyone I'm come in contact with over the last few months knows all I have been talkin about is gettin a car. I've been workin like a slave tryin to slave up for one. Anyone can help me by sharing info about anyone selling a car, any car auction, etc., sharing info about open job opportunities in the area, or money will be greatly appreciated. Please help me!! I refuse to be pounding the pavement as a sophomore on Philly streets!!

1. I won't have to rely on public transportation.

2. I can get to more places quicker which will open up more job opportunities.

3. I am not selfish so I will give rides (depending on distance and time..gas is high these days lol)</description>
