  <description>Unity08 believes that neither of today&#8217;s major parties reflects the aspirations, fears or will of the majority of Americans. Both have polarized and alienated the people. Both are unduly influenced by single-issue groups. Both are excessively dominated by money.

1. Goal One is the election of a Unity Ticket for President and Vice-President of the United States in 2008 &#8212; headed by a woman and/or man from each major party or by an independent who presents a Unity Team from both parties.

2. Goal Two is for the people themselves to pick that Unity Ticket in the first half of 2008 &#8212; via a virtual and secure online convention in which all American voters will be qualified to vote.

3. Goal Three is for the delegates to that convention to select the issues which are crucial to America&#8217;s future and the questions on those crucial issues which the candidates should address fully and candidly.</description>
