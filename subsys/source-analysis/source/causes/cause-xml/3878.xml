  <description>ShopforMuseums.com is a free online fundraising program for museums and related organizations.  We are partnered with over 400 online retailers.  People are able to do their everyday online shopping at any of our partnered retailers and a percentage of the purchase price is donated back to the museum of their choice.

This is a completely free program for museums, and is also at no extra cost to the shoppers.  This is possible because 100% of the funding for this program is provided by the marketing budgets of the online retailers.

This is an excellent opportunity for museums to fundraise, and for the community surrounding the museum to get involved and support it.

1. Help keep the doors of our museums nation wide open.</description>
