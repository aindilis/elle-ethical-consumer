  <description>CARE is a leading humanitarian organization fighting global poverty. 

Website: http://www.care.org/index.asp

We place special focus on working alongside poor WOMEN because, equipped with the proper resources, women have the power to help whole families and entire communities escape poverty. Women are at the heart of CARE's community-based efforts to improve basic education, prevent the spread of HIV, increase access to clean water and sanitation, expand economic opportunity and protect natural resources. CARE also delivers emergency aid to survivors of war and natural disasters, and helps people rebuild their lives.
