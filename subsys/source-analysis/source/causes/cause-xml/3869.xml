  <description>We The People of The Coalition For The Prevention Of Unintelligent People Breading (CPUPB) strongly believe that unintelligent people are ruining our world by constantly spawning more unintelligent offspring.

Kurt Vonnegut once said that America was a nation run by C students. We here at CPUPB believe that the reason for that is there are so many unintelligent people breeding in America that the unintelligent have vastly outnumbered the intelligent and there for America's democracy has become a form of "tyranny of the majority" as Alexis de Tocqueville suspected.

Intelligent people must rise and be heard. 

The rampant breeding of the unintelligent must stop.

1. Unintelligent People Must Stop Breeding

2. The Government (If it didn't suck) Must Issue A License To Have A Child

3. The Government (If it didn't suck) Must Put People Through  A Rigorous Testing Program In Order To Receive Said License</description>
