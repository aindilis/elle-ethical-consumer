  <description>Mobilize.org, formerly Mobilizing America's Youth is an all-partisan network dedicated to educating, empowering, and energizing young people to increase our civic engagement and political participation. We work to show young people how their lives are impacted by public policy and in turn, how we can impact public policy.

1. Educate: With thousands of books already in circulation, the Mobilizer&#8217;s Guidebook is a compilation of lessons learned over time; and as an easy-to-use guide, it walks students through the 10 Steps to Mobilize.

2. Empower: With over 100 member organizations and a combined list-serv of 2 million youth and youth advocates, the Youth Policy Action Center (YPAC) is the one-stop shop for learning about policy impacting youth, finding your local decision makers and media

3. Energize: With over 75 Mobilizer teams on college and high school campuses and in communities across the country, Mobilizers organize around issues that are important to their local community. </description>
