  <description>recently marc (kezz) cut his flowing mane. at first it wouldnt seem that bad, after all....kieran did it and he's still a complete stud-lauren and sarah will agree, but the cut has given marc the likeness of a full-blown, leather-wearing lesbo. any money we can raise is worth it as long as we can help marc and his poor girlfriend kelsey.

1. marc is a man!!! lets help him stay one!!</description>
