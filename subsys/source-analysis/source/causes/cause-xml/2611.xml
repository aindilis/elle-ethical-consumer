  <description>I saw the quote "Peace Starts in the Womb" on a simple bumper sticker just while driving around. Abortion isn't just something that happens and that doesn't involve you.... Its Real, its Happening, and yes you can do more than you think you can :) First of all we can help by educating those and putting awareness out about the consequences and downsides of abortion. One example of this is the fact that the soon to be mom would have given birth to a wonderful child to either keep, love, or pass on to another couple that might not have been able to have children. There are many couples that are waiting for an infant that they could raise. Second, we need to keep America from being desensitized! We've traded the word MURDER for Terminating and child, life or baby for fetus. Life starts at conception and all those innocent "fetuses" have been murdered and have had no chance to make a life for themselves. They have not been given the chance to serve their country in a way only they could do. Yes women have rights, but what about the rights and welfare of the unborn child who cannot speak for itself

1. Educate those with unplanned pregnancies about the consequences and downsides of abortion.

2. Educate those with unplanned pregnancies about other options besides abortion. (You can always get your body back, and a life is not worth keeping your figure over!)

3. As the National Pro-Life Alliance says, "to END, not simply regulate abortion."</description>
