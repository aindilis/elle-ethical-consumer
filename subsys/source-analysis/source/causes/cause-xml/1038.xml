  <description>My sister's boy pup, Clyde, is having seizures and they are becoming more frequent by the day. 

Every seizure causes more brain damage and therefore needs to be stopped as soon as possible. 

She is giving up everything she has for him but it is not enough since she has just purchased a new home with an enormous yard intended for Clyde to play in. 

I've been brainstorming ways on how to raise money for his operations and I'm doing all I can to help her because I myself am a HUGE animal lover. 

Clyde is a very loving, gentle, kind-hearted puppy. Please help restore his great nature!
