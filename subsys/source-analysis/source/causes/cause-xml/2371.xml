  <description>These fossils that decide to get behind the wheel are ticking time bombs. 

FACT: By age 60 you need three times as much light as you did at age 20 to drive safely at night.

There are many reasons seniors should be kept off the road. Actually, 'many' is an understatement. Visual decline, hearing loss, drowsiness from the numerous meds they are one, and dementia. Old people are crazy, and there is nothing you can do about it except laugh at them and pull on their skin.

To make a point, my grandma drives. She can't even remember my name sometimes, how the hell is she suppose to read a yeild sign?

If you feel a senior is unfit to be on the road, and they refuse to give you the keys, here is what you should do:

1) Explain the reasoning behind your suggestion.
2) Refer them to this facebook group.
3) If still no co-operation, drive your elbow into the elder's hip bone. It should break on contact.
4) Take the car and re-paint it.
5) Sell it to Ray Ray on Wyandotte and Walker.

1. Old people are good for nothing, why give them a privledge?

2. They are not only a danger to others, but to themselves. Their brittle bodies may shatter in a collision.

3. They drive slower then Asians.</description>
