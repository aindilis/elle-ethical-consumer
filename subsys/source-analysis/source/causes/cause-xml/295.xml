Mike Huckabee has the opportunity to change the face of the Republican Party. A governor for 10 and a half years, Huckabee is a solid and consistent social and fiscal conservative. Governor Huckabee cut taxes over 94 times and wants to enact the fair tax at the federal level. His response to the Katrina crisis proves that he can respond well to crisis situations. He understands the challenges we face in this global war on terror. An effective communicator, the Governor appeals to nontraditional constituencies, including his ability to garner over 40% of the African American vote in his two elections as governor.
