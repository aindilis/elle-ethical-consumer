  <description>Fresh vegetarian food carried on bicycles filling stomachs in the name of Jesus.

The Hospitality Train is hospitality on wheels. It is a community meal for the streets. We prepare fresh, healthy meals utilizing vegetables from our community garden, as well as other organic ingredients.

The Hospitality Train is sponsored by Missio Dei, a mennonite church in the Cedar Riverside neighborhood.

The idea is simple: we load up our bikes and trikes, bringing fresh ingredients and high quality portable cooking equipment to feed people good food. Along with food preparers/servers, we are sometimes joined by musicians who will play as we serve food.
