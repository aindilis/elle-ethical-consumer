The more who agree with him and/or willing to do something, the closer we are to combating Global Warming.This is why:"The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences." - Winston Churchill, 1936.Our "wake-up call" is Katrina.

1. We believe that Global Warming is influenced mostly by humans.

2. We believe that Global Warming is "getting worse."

3. We believe that we have the technology to combat global warming before it's too late!

4. We have had enough delays. It's time to act!!

5. All we need to do is make some calls, go to some stores, and start to "tackle" this crisis.

6. We will listen to Al Gore!</description>
