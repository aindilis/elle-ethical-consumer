  <description>People who are homeless dont ask for much.. htey just want a job.. a house.. and something to live for.. they have nothing except whatever they carry around on the streets.

People under estimate them. If they are given the chance they can be either better than some of us or not.. but they deserve a chance.. 

Give them that chance and donate.

1. Homeless mistreatment must stop.</description>
