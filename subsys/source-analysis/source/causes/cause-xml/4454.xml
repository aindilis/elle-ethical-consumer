  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THE FACTS&lt;/strong&gt;
An estimated 35.1 million Americans are food insecure; meaning their access to enough food is limited by a lack of money and other resources. &lt;br&gt;
 
There are more than 4,000 colleges and universities and more than 110,000 K-12 schools in the United States. Nearly every single one has the following:
*an on-campus kitchen
*small quantities of surplus food from dining hall operations
*students who are becoming more and more engaged in community service

&lt;strong&gt;CKP'S PLAN OF ACTION&lt;/strong&gt;
We partner with high schools, colleges, and universities to share on-campus kitchen space, receive donated food from cafeterias, and inspires students to provide more than 150,000 meals each year. Currently, CKP operates 10 Campus Kitchens and with your support can open more!

1. Everyone should have access to food.

2. Students can make an impact in their local communities.</description>
