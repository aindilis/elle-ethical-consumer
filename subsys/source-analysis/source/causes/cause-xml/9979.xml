  <description>Chords for a Cure was started in Fall of 2004 and has since thrown a show (roughly) once a month. Sometimes it's a live show and other times it's simply a dance.

The charities it's helped raise money for have been Penn State Delco THON, Invisible Children, City of LIfe, Salvation Army, Luekemia Society and Katrina Victims among other charities.
