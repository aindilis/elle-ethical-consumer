  <description>From American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU):

"The system of government is founded on two counterbalancing principles: that the majority of the people governs, through democratically elected representatives; and that the power even of a democratic majority must be limited, to ensure individual rights.

Majority power is limited by the Constitution's Bill of Rights, which consists of the original ten amendments ratified in 1791, plus the three post-Civil War amendments (the 13th, 14th and 15th) and the 19th Amendment (women's suffrage), adopted in 1920."

1. Preserve your First Amendment rights-freedom of speech, association and assembly. Freedom of the press, and freedom of religion supported by the strict separation of church and state.

2. Preserve your right to equal protection under the law - equal treatment regardless of race, sex, religion or national origin.

3. Preserve your right to due process - fair treatment by the government whenever the loss of your liberty or property is at stake.

4. Preserve your right to privacy - freedom from unwarranted government intrusion into your personal and private affairs.

5. Acknowledge that as appreciative naturalized citizens, our duty is even greater to insure previous positions.</description>
