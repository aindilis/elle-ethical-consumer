  <description>The College Democrats of America (CDA) is the official student outreach arm of the Democratic Party. It aims to train and engage new generations of Democratic activists and shape the Democratic Party with voices from America's youth. In election years, College Democrats work hard to mobilize student voters and recruit volunteers for Democratic campaigns, from town council to President of the United States. In 2004, CDA recruited activists on more than 1200 campuses in all 50 states.</description>
