  <description>Kaitlin Marie Hanson was born on January 18th 1998. She died on January 29th 2000. She was 2 years old and died of S.I.D.S (suddenly instant death). The death is still unknown.. We all miss her very much! Everyone who has lost a sister or brother would know how much it hurts to lose a sibbling. It feels like you wanna do something about it, but you cant! She is the daughter of Todd and Tracey Hanson of Clear Lake Iowa. Sister of Haley and Lauren Hanson. They all have had a hard and difficult time sittuation through all these years. Everyday that goes by is just another day she is gone, but another day that her friends and family are wishing that she is still here with every each and one of us. Many people say "she's in a better place now" and maybe that can be true, but where ever she goes, she will go with her heart..and follow her dreams to where ever she wants to go!
