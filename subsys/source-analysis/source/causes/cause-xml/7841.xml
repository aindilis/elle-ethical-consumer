  <description>For over 35 years Metropolitan Ministries has served poor and homeless men, women, and children in the Tampa Bay region. We serve approximately 80 families daily through Outreach Services, with a dramatic increase during the Holiday Season.  In 2006, we served over 15,000 families - a 33% increase.  80 children and 40 adults call Metroplitan Ministries their home every night. We offer a full range of services to families throughout the community. 

Metropolitan Ministries currently has 25 babies, under the age of 2 &#189; in residence, plus two mothers who are 9 months pregnant. Our residents have urgent need for diapers and pull-ups. In addition to the babies in residence, 80-100 families visit Outreach each day with emergency needs. Shower our littlest ones with these items: Disposable Diapers (Especially sizes # 5 &amp; #6) Pull-Ups Formula Baby food and fruit Formula Baby Wipes Used or new car seats, strollers, etc. 

Last year over 700 children received a Backpack of Hope.  This year we want to do so much more, but we need your help.  Our goal is to distribute more than 1,000 Backpacks of Hope.  You can help by coordinating a school-supply drive and donating your time to volunteer.
