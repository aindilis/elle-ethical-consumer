  <description>There's a reason that Facebook was created, and it was not meant to be "the New MySpace." Chances are if you want a MySpace you can go join MySpace, but Facebook is for people who want facebook. No more top friends! These applications are too much for us facebookers to handle. Enough is enough! We need to stop this before its too late!

1. Facebook and MySpace are completely different.

2. Top 24's are for MySpace only.</description>
