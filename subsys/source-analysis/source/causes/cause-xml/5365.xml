Fess up... You love the attention that your huge SUV gives you.  Half of the attention you receive is just plain disgust from total strangers! Hurrah!

It's not worth it. Trade in for an economical car with giant chrome spinners and paint that bad boy bright yellow -- you'll still get all the attention you crave, but you'll help save the environment while you're at it! 

Your attention is not worth our children's future.

1. We must put harsher regulations for pollution output of motor vehicles.

2. Car companys should regulate a minumum amount of mileage of their vehicles.

3. Everyone must pitch in and remember that looking cool isn't as important as the earth.</description>
