  <description>EGR (www.e4gr.org / www.e4gr.blogspot.com) is an organization resourcing a grassroots movement of Episcopalians connecting and collaborating in creative ministry to end extreme poverty. We find our charge in Christ's charge to seek and serve him in the poorest of the poor. The structure we use for this movement is the Millennium Development Goals (http://www.e4gr.org/learn/mgd-101.html). Our focus is helping communities of youth and young adults connect -- and to help them get the resources they need to give the church a kick  and lead the faithful out of the pews and into the world to end extreme poverty. This is about encouraging creative, exciting ministry and changing the world -- nothing less.

1. Young adults and youth are the engine that will drive the church's transforming presence in the movement to end global extreme poverty

2. The alleviation of material suffering in the world and the spiritual renewal of the church go hand in hand.

3. The movement to end extreme poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals is a movement of spiritual transformation -- not just of the church but of the world.</description>
