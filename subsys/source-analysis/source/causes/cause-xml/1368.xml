  <description>For all those who know the dearness and awesomeness of Owasippe. For all those who cannot bear to see it get rezoned just so Stone and the CAC can make a profit on it. For all those who want this amazing camp to be open for their children, and their children's children. For all those have ever been to Owasippe. For all those who have seen a majestic bald eagle fly over Big Blue Lake. For all those who have attended a Wolverine campfire and can hear their shouts echo back to them. For all those who have visited Owasippe's grave. And for all those who have given up their summers as staff, I beg you support this cause.

1. Summer Camp is a vital part of Boy Scouts.

2. If rezoned, it will be gone forever.

3. Scouting is about giving a valuable program to the kids, not about making ends meet.

4. Owasippe is America's oldest Boy Scout camp and must remain as one for the Scouts.</description>
