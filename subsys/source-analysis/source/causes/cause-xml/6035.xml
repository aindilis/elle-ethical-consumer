  <description>Religion, in this day and age, is a waste of time, money, precious resources, and most importantly lives! Thousands of people kill each other in the name of religion. What is religion? Just a bunch of stories some old men made up long ago to control the masses! Religion worked in the old days, when law and society were not as refined as they are today. While responsible for the deaths of thousands, it was a good form of GOVERNMENT, for a while at least. Now most nations have better sources of leadership and the religions out there have become obsolete, a needless crutch for the people, and a tool for the leaders. It is time to get rid of religion. With religion out of the picture some of the solutions to the planet's most controversial problems are easily solved! Religion helped us for as long as we needed it, it is time for the healing process to begin so that we can reach our full potential as human beings.

1. Stop the atrocities commited in the name of religion.

2. Convince people to find inner strength instead of relying on the imaginary force, "God".

3. Don't allow ancient books to tell you what is right and wrong, when they are so obviously out dated.</description>
