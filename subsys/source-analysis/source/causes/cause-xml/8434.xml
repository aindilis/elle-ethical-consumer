  <description>this card game needs more effort than existing Olympic games..... it needs concentration plus it enhances ur capability to think and read a person's mentality and personality.... its more than a card game!!!! 

ps: if we succeed lebanon will be presented by its national varsity which is currently holding 4 players : Mr. Uday mezher ( me) , Mr. Nizam madi , Mr. Bernard kalaani , and Mr. Mhammad kbar......

1. IT IS A CATASTROPHY THAT ILKHA ISNT CONSIDERED AS AN OLYMPIC GAME!!!!

2. LEABNON HAS A BIG CHANCE OF GETTING THE GOLD MEDAL WITH THE CURRENT PLAYERS IN ACTION !! :p</description>
