  <description>Kiva empowers individuals to lend to an entrepreneur across the globe. By combining microfinance with the internet, Kiva is creating a global community of people connected through lending.

Kiva was born of the following beliefs:

*People are by nature generous, and will help others if given the opportunity to do so in a transparent, accountable way.

*The poor are highly motivated and can be very successful when given an opportunity.

*By connecting people we can create relationships beyond financial transactions, and build a global community expressing support and encouragement of one another.

Kiva promotes:

*Dignity: Kiva encourages partnership relationships as opposed to benefactor relationships. Partnership relationships are characterized by mutual dignity and respect.

*Accountability: Loans encourage more accountability than donations where repayment is not expected.

*Transparency: The Kiva website is an open platform where communication can flow freely around the world.

As of November 2009, Kiva has facilitated over $100 million in loans.
