  <description>The impact and extent of the aids epidemic in Africa is only just starting to be realised.  Many people dont realise the suffering and death that takes place, or even the effect aids has on everyone around the world.  As the disease spreads more and more countries are effected, not just those in Africa.  Lots of people either choose not to learn about the widely growing problem and others may not know exactly what is taking place due to lack of knowledge or information.  The purpose of this cause is to raise money to help in the epidemic and possibly save lives, as well as spreading awareness all over to make sure as many people as possible are no longer ignorant to the situation.

1. the aids epidemic is not only Africa's problem.

2. proper health care for those involved should be given.

3. The world needs to stand up against aids</description>
