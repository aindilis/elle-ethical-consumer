  <description>Most of us are blessed in the sense that we have had the opportunity to experience college, be it from our own merit, family support, or  educational/athletic scholarships, but the one thing that has allowed for this chance at a better life is the opportunity itself. However, for many kids of Inner-city Chicago, a life's opportunity isn&#8217;t always reached, either because of the lack of moral upbringing in the home, peer pressures from an overwhelming society, gang influence, or simply the lack of hope. For whatever the specific reason, I would like to help Youth Guidance, who has taken on this challenge, and made it an aim to counter the problem of a lack of opportunity  by giving guidance and hope to kids who need it as much as anyone in this nation.  

Not only do they go into these neighborhoods, they target the broken homes, schools in the area of gang violence, and mentor/guide them on the hope of life through their mentoring. They act as the sole voice, most often times the only voice these kids will hear, and the seed that the sew is irreplaceable.  I challenge everyone who has been blessed the chance to live a normal or even decent life, donate to this cause and recognize the need to put aside race, politics, or any other un-relating matter to address this critical need in our own society.
