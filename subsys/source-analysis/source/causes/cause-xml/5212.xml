  <description>As many of you know, I help support/promote DarkCrux Clothing. Well a good friend of mine was recently diagnosed with meningitis.  I personally, am not all that familiar with the effects of meningitis, but I know it is a serious matter.  So I've decided to start this cause to try and raise money for both causes.  DarkCrux is a new(ish) clothing company and they need money to spread their ideas to everyone else.  By donating to this cause, not only will you help millions with meningitis, but you'll also help a local man achieve his dream of his clothing companies success.  50% (or more) of your donation will be sent to local hospitals and other surrounding states for meningitis, and the other half will go towards new merchandise for DarkCrux.   Once again, I would really appreciate any amount.

Thank You,

Jeremy W.
