  <description>Eating vegetables is wrong. When a human rips a vegetable from the ground, he or she is killing a form of life that has no chance to escape. Vegetables are rooted to the ground and don't stand a chance. Please, eat animals instead, since they at least have a chance.

1. Vegetables don't have a sporting chance of survival, so we shouldn't eat them.

2. Animales such as cows can at least move, making it more humane to eat them instead.

3. Meat tastes better anyway.

4. Vegetarians are evil abusers of nature.</description>
