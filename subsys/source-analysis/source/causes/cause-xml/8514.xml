  <description>WGCBT is a group of three ladies who are making their by bicycle from the US capital to the francaphone capital of North America and back.  Along the way they are documenting their travel and visits to urban food gardens, rural local food movements, co-ops, and CSA farms to promote viable alternatives to the current industrial agricultural market and link them to demonstrate growth in the movement. Stops include Baltimore, Philadelphia, Princeton NJ, NYC, Montreal, Vermont, Connecticut, Boston and various points in between.

This tremendous threesome is comprised no of less than; Liz "Tree Lady" Tylander, Favorite Daughter of Nebraska, Kat Schiffler and Laure "Lightning Fast" Sheets.  When not zipping cross country via self propelled mechanical contraptions they make their nest at 7th St. Garden in D.C.'s Shaw neighborhood.

These ladies need your support.  Please send checks, post cards and your kindest regards to
