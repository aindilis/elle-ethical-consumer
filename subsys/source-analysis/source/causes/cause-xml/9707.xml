  <description>If you feel that you are having a problem with drugs or alcohol, you are not alone and we are here to help.  Addiction knows no age, race, economic or geographic boundary.  It can begin with a growing dependence on prescription medications, a teenager's experimentation with a "harmless drug," or unwinding after work with a few beers at "happy hour."  But for millions of people it is just a first step in the predictable downward spiral of addiction.  If you are unsure if you have a problem, the "self test," will help you look honestly at your situation.
