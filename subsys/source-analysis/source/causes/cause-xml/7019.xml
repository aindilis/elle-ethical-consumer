Marine Conservation Biology Institute (MCBI) was founded in 1996 and works nationally and globally to safeguard ocean ecosystems and wildlife.  MCBI is one of the world&#8217;s most influential marine conservation organizations. 

MCBI works to advance marine conservation biology because people will not conserve what they don't love and understand.

1. We believe that marine ecosystem-based management is the way to protect, recover and sustainably use the living sea.

2. We advocate for the multidisciplinary science of marine conservation biology.

3. We bring scientists together to examine the most important issues. If something isn&#8217;t both true and important, we don&#8217;t advocate for it.

4. We cooperate with whoever will help us conserve the oceans&#8217; biodiversity.</description>
