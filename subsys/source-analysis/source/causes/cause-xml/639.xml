  <description>In a world where practically anyone can publish via the internet, and televisions are used more than books, it is necessary for us sticklers to promote good grammar. 

So if you're (note: not "your") tired of people confusing "to" with "too" and "it's" with "its," then join the cause to preserve our language for future generations.

All donations go to the Grammar Mechanics Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting proper grammar.

1. The advent of net-speak has led to a disturbing trend: the degradation of our grammar as an English-speaking people.

2. To combat the trend of sloppy language, we must promote good grammar, embrace it and politely correct the culprits.</description>
