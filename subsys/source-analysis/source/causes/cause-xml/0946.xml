  <description>Child Abuse in Maldives is a disease which has been eating away at our society, but nothing has been done in terms of awareness, prevention and justice.

Therefore we have created both this cause and a group under the same name. We look forward to seeing all of you on both with your support for our cause :)

SO BOYS AND GIRLS. THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE ON THE CAUSE, AND NOT ON THE GROUP, MOVE YOUR TUSHIES NOW AND JOIN UP. COS THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS HAPPENIG OVER THERE AND WE WOULD APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S INPUT. THANK U ONE AND ALL :)
