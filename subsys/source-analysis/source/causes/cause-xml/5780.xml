  <description>I made a pledge on Madison McClendon's behalf nearly a year ago: A pledge to send one dollar to Darfur for every person who would be willing to stand up and be counted.  The response was greater than we could have ever imagined.  But now Madison needs help!  He can't send as much money as he'd like to Darfur all on his own.  Please, help Madison send the 1,085 dollars he's pledged to Darfurian aid by making a contribution to his cause - the cause of our generation.
