  <description>Tom Coles is broke as a joke right now because his boss (Spiros)decided to take a leave of absence,thus leaving Tom scraping for pennies!!!
So any donations to keep Tom afloat would be greatly accepted...Tom is taking cash donations or anything in a liquid form(preferably with alcohol in it!!!!)so please feel free to donate to my cause,and pass the word around...i must go now they're about to shut off my pow...
