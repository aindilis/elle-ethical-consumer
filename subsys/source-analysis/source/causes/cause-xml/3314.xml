  <description>Nestle actively promotes bottle feeding in third world countries... countries that cant afford to pay for the formula, countries that dont have clean water to make the formula. by giving out free samples in hospitals to these new mothers, they are left with little options once their breast milk has dried up. Thanks to Nestle's marketing schemes, thousands of babies are being killed. 

1. Nestle has no regard for human life. 

2. Innocent babies are dying.

3. Mothers are not properly educated.</description>
