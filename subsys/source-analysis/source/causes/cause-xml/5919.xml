  <description>Beth Charczynski Wright was born and grew up on Beals Island Maine. After graduating magna cum laude from the University of Maine at Machias, she taught public school and then joined her husband Wayne in their family business.

At 24, Beth was diagnosed with breast cancer. Following surgery and chemotherapy, she began a support group at the Downeast Community Hospital in Machias to help others living with cancer. Shortly after the birth of their second son, Beth and Wayne learned her cancer had spread to her liver and bones. Beth faced cancer with strength and faith, and created the Choose Life Foundation shortly before her death, at 28, in August 2000.

Eventually, the Choose Life Foundation merged into the Beth C. Wright Cancer Resource Center to achieve the goals Beth had foreseen for her foundation.

1. Cancer patients and their families should have access to the tools needed to fight their disease.</description>
