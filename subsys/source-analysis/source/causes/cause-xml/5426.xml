  <description>I have lost my granmother, my uncle, my mother and many distant relatives to this hereditary cancer.  I have so far battled a brain tumour and Renal Cell Carcinoma, neither were near as difficult as hearing that my children all tested positive for the same fate.
This disease kills and the killing must end.

www.vhl.org for more information.

1. People must be able to live their life without the fear of annother new tumour.

2. Those who are battling VHL should be offered support, both moraly and when in trouble, fnancially.

3. Children should be able to be children without worrying about when they will get cancer.</description>
