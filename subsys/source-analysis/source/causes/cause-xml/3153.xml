  <description>I am racing an Ironman triathlon in Penticton, BC and hope to raise money to help reduce climate change. The race consists of a 2.4 mi (3.8km) swim, 112mi (180km) bike and a 26.2 (42km) run and takes place on August 26th. All money raised will go to the Global Footprint Network to help advance the science of sustainability. Check it out at www.footprintnetwork.org. Even a couple of bucks would help. Thanks!

1. Climate Change is currently the most pressing environmental issue.

2. We need to find a way for our society to grow in a sustainable way.</description>
