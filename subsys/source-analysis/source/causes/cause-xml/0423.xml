  <description>Help stand up against the olligopoly controlling the music we hear on the radio, how much we pay for our music, and what we can do with music once we've paid for it. Stand up for the rights of the artists who make the music and record it, not the suits who publish the music and make the majority of the profit. Speak out against malevolent contracts between artists and the recording industry, and fight back against payola- Big Four record companies paying radio stations and DJs to play their songs more.

Save our music and the originality which drives this art onward.

1. Artists' rights must be protected from corporate greed

2. Independent music must be supported and proliferated

3. The Big Four has an olligopoly on our music, and must be restrained</description>
