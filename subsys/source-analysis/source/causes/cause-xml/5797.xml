  <description>The Sea Turtle Restoration Project (STRP) fights to protect endangered sea turtle populations in ways that meet the ecological needs of the sea turtles and the oceans and the needs of the local communities who share the beaches and waters with these gentle, beautiful creatures.

Industrial longlining and gill netting are currently the greatest threats to the continued existence to the Pacific leatherback sea turtle, the world's largest turtle species, which is now teetering on the verge of extinction. You can help make the difference between extinction and recovery for the Pacific leatherback! Please join us in making the Oceans safe for leatherbacks and marine species.

1. Turtles have been on Earth since prehistoric times, don't let them die now.

2. The government needs to recognize these lives.

3. Today three of the seven existing species are critically endangered with extinction.</description>
