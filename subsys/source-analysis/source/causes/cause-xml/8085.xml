  <description>The Steven Spring Foundation (SSF), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, was founded to aid the survivors of Hurricane Katrina.  Specifically, by supplying donated instruments and free musical instruction to anyone in need, SSF provides much-needed practical assistance to the musicians, music students and children of New Orleans as they struggle to recover from the disaster.  

The SSF strives to bring the healing power of music to the people who need it most: to working musicians who become productive again through the donated instruments that they receive, to dedicated amateur players who are grateful to be able to express and release the deep, powerful feelings raised by the storm and its aftermath, and to all the fortunate listeners who reap the emotional benefits that only music can provide.

One of our latest programs was a 6-week summer music program for local children. We've put up a slideshow of the kids for you to enjoy at http://s161.photobucket.com/albums/t236/stevenspringfoundation/Summer%20Band%20Program/?action=view&amp;current=48b4965c.pbw
