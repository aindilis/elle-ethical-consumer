  <description>Life is breath.  The quality of our air is the quality of our life.  

Have you ever driven by a pig farm and wished that the air was cleaner.  Stop wishing and start doing.  Knock on the farmers door and tell him his farm stinks.  Then give him my name and tell him to contact me.  Then contact me yourself and give me his address.  Do the same with other air polluters.

Nothing happens without action.  

Small steps are all that is required.  Get ready to do someting about it.
