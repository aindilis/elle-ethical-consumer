  <description>*What is FAME?*

The Fund for the Advancement of Music Education (FAME) is an MENC (National Association for Music Education)-administered program that seeks to improve and expand music education for all by effecting changes in the general public's perception of its importance. 

The program's goals are;to increase public awareness of the importance of music education, 
to promote public support for music education at the local, state, and federal levels, and to reach out beyond the parameters of the teaching profession to the world in which Americans learn about and make music. 

FAME currently supports a number of projects, including the National Anthem Project, 'Why Music?' and Music in our Schools Month, as well as donating instruments to needy schools and aiding musical outreach programs.

1. MENC's mission is to advance music education by encouraging the study and making of music by all.

2. Music allows us to celebrate and preserve our cultural heritages, and also to explore the realms of expression, imagination, and creation resulting in new knowledge. Therefore, every individual should be guaranteed the opportunity to learn music.</description>
