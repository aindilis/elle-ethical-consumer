  <description>The Blue Grass Trust was founded in 1955 by a spirited group of Lexington citizens who were determined to save the John Wesley Hunt residence from demolition. This group raised funds to purchase and restore the property, now known as the Hunt-Morgan House, to its original 1814 appearance. Today, the house stands as a testimonial to the beginning of the Blue Grass Trust and the birth of the preservation movement in Central Kentucky.

Over the years, the Trust has helped save many other historic structures, including the Dudley House, Shakertown of Pleasant Hill, the Adam Rankin House, Henry Clay&#8217;s Law Office, Belle Breezing&#8217;s Row Houses, the Mary Todd Lincoln House, the Stilfield Log House and Benjamin Latrobe&#8217;s Pope Villa.

Today, the Trust continues to provide valuable leadership and inspiration to the preservation movement in Central Kentucky and throughout the state. As the region&#8217;s leading preservation organization, the Trust works diligently to fulfill its mission of education, service and advocacy.

1. Our ongoing mission is to preserve and protect the historic built environment and the heritage of the bluegrass region of Kentucky. Through advocacy, activism and education we pursue this mission every day.</description>
