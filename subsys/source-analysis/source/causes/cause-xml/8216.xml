  <description>Every day a beach suffers the adverse effects of reckless trash and waste disposal. Every month a beach is closed because polluted water makes the ocean unsafe to enter. Every year a coastline recedes a bit more from overdevelopment and erosion.
Had enough? Want to help stem this negative tide? Get involved with Project Blue.
Here&#8217;s the deal: You buy specially designed, exclusive Project Blue gear you want, like clothing and accessories, from our participating partners. They donate part of the proceeds to fund coastline protection initiatives nationwide.
