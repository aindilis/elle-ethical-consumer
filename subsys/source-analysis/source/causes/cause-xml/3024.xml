  <description>P3s do not save governments money and in fact may cost more. 

P3s do not improve care or provide better service. 

P3s will put Canada's public health care system in grave danger from Free Trade Agreements like NAFTA and GATS.

P3s are not a neutral financing mechanism - it is a source of borrowing which has to be repaid! -- either out of the public purse or by giving the private sector a concession (e.g. allowing the company to charge user fees). 

P3s have enormous implications for public life and profound constitutional and democratic implications.

P3s in hospitals, clinics and health insurance have all been abysmal failures in the United States. Public-Private Partnerships promote unfairness and exploitation. It's not a partnership -- it's an oxymoron. The public pays while the private sector profits. That's not a partnership.

There has been no public or parliamentary debate on the critical issue of P3 schemes in Canada.

Canadian governments (federal, provincial, territorial and municipal) should not enter into P3s in the field of health care. Instead, the federal government should re-commit to providing stable, long-term funding for Canada's Public Health Care system.

1. Keep Health Care Public in Canada.
