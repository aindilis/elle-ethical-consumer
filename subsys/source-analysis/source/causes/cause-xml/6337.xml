  <description>There are many livers awaiting the liqiuds we best define as alcohol. Many of us seem to think our bodies do not need such fluids. But not true. Ask Dr. Tequila Sunrise He'll inform you and guide you through better living, a better way of falling to the ground and pissing your self with your hand in your crotch, some of us like to call this a form a retardation. I like to call it drinking with passion. So kids, adults, grandpa's, grandma's drink alcohol and get fuked....


Thankyou
