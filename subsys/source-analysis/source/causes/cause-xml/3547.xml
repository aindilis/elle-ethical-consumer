  <description>Children's Advocacy Centers offer a new way of serving abused children through a comprehensive approach to services for victims and their families. These programs are designed by professionals and volunteers responding to the needs of their own communities. Children's Advocacy Centers stress coordination of investigation and intervention services by bringing together professionals and agencies as a multidisciplinary team to create a child-focused approach to child abuse cases. The goal is to ensure that children are not revictimized by the very system designed to protect them.
