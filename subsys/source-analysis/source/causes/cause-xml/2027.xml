  <description>There is no reason why people should be drinking 5-10 or more bottles of beer or any other alcochol a day!
The reason why I ma bringing this up is because well...do you really want another car accident caused by some stupid person drinking and driving.Do you really want to lose another family member or friend.Do you really want another family to suffer.Well if the answer is no then why wont anybody do anything and thats where we come in we need to try and earn money or put up signs and posters or something just to get those who do drink and drives attention


1. i believe we can stop this if we really try

2. i beleive that if we do really try that there will be less familys suffering

3. i believe that if we do try as hard as we can then nobody will have to die from drunk driving and other alcohol related deseases etc.</description>
