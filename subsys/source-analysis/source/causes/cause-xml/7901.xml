  <description>We as Christians need to either be out there in the battle as Jonathon's or along side the Jonathon's as armor-bearers. At a camp this past summer a speaker asked us to be armor-bearers and Jonathon's...I am an armor-bearer for Christ...which will you be?

1. The battle for Christ must be fought.

2. It won't be easy, but someone has to do it.

3. Romans 12:2</description>
