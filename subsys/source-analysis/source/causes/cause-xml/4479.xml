  <description>Children in abusive homes need to be rescued, yet there are so many cases that the government might never know about.  Our goal is to support one organization in it's effort to find these children and stop the abuse being done to them, to show them love and care.  We need to show the world that we care about these children, and any victim of abuse.  Though abuse can never be undone, those who are victims of such disgusting trauma can be helped to heal their wounds through genuine love and support.  Many of these people have never been in a situation in which someone simply cares about them without expecting something back.  The purpose of this is to show that there are people who care and want to help those victims, even stop the abuse if we can in some way.

1. Abuse of all kinds is wrong

2. Victims of abuse need help

3. Child abuse must be stopped

4. Child abuse perminently hurts the child mentally, physically, and spiritually</description>
