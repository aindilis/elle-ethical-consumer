  <description>I dont know about you, but punk'd is the worst show ever, what does is have to do with music, or laguna beach, or road rules. MTV is not mtv its reality tv. Reality shows are gay and they make me want to shoot myself.

1. Bring back music videos to mtv

2. Get rid of reality shows on mtv

3. Bring back rock and metal to mtv, i mean whats up with all this hip hop shit?</description>
