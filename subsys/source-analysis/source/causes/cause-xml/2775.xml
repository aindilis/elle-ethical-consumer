  <description>Habitat for Humanity is an ecumenical housing ministry that seeks to eliminate homelessness and substandard housing by making decent affordable shelter a matter of conscience and action for all people. We build our homes with volunteer labor and donations of material, supplies, land, and services. Habitat sells each home, with a no-interest mortgage, to a low-income family who is without adequate shelter. The family becomes an active Habitat partner contributing many hours of "sweat equity" during the construction of their home. Habitat for Humanity of Prairie Lakes (HfHPL) was affiliated in May, 2004 and is a partner with Habitat for Humanity International (HfHI). In June, 2006 the geographic boundaries were expanded to include Stevens County.
