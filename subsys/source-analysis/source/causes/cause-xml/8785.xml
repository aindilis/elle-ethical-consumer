Hey,you could even find one of their home addresses and bombard them with letters there. I don't care, just safe Mr. Keiser!

I ALSO THINK IT'D BE REALLY NICE TO SEND MR. KEISER THANK YOU LETTERS!

I had to pick a nonprofit organization so I went with Catholic Charities.

1. Mr. Keiser is an excellent teacher.

2. He was fired on false premises.

3. I cannot, in good conscience, support Bishop Carroll's lowering academic standards!</description>
  <mission>Bring Bishop Carroll back into decency and have Mr. Keiser reinstated!</mission>
