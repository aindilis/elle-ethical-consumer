  <description>The Center for American Progress is a progressive think-tank dedicated to improving the lives of Americans through ideas and action.

We are creating a long-term, progressive vision for America&#8212;a vision that policy makers, thought-leaders and activists can use to shape the national debate and pass laws that make a difference.

1. We must build an opportunity nation where every hard-working person, regardless of background, can realize their dreams through education, decent work and fair play

2. We need to reawaken America's conscience, our sense of shared and personal responsibility, to build healthy, vibrant communities

3. We must reform government so that it is of, by and for the people: open, effective, and committed to the common good

4. We need to use America's strength to bring the world together, not pull it apart</description>
