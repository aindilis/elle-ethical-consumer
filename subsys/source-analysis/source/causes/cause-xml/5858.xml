  <description>Too often are lives ruined. Too many people lie in jail, waiting, wondering what will happen to them. Why? Because they decided to smoke a joint. Because the police found a stem in the person's car. 

Potheads love to give excuses to maintaining their habit by saying it's not as bad as other drugs and etc. But, just because it can't kill you the first time like all the other stuff, doesn't mean it's not bad. Also, where is the criminal element in private marijuana use. It's as criminal as eating McDonald's. Both are bad for you. In both cases, the person is only harming themselves. And, often times the two activities are done together because pot makes McDonald's taste so much better.

So if you find it logical to place someone who smokes pot and eats fries while watching TV with those who murder, steal, cheat, and etc., just sit down and think about it. Alcohol kills people and destroys families and pot kills brain cells and disappoints families. Legalize the damned thing and stop wasting my hard earned tax dollars on arresting and jailing people who sit around, eat fries and watch tv.


1. Decriminalize personal and medical marijuana use.

2. Set common restrictions on it such as age refine DUI-D laws.

3. Save money.</description>
  <mission>Legalize non-violent personal marijuana use for those of age.</mission>
