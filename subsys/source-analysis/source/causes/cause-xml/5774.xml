  <description>Blackwater USA is a corporate army which is not affliated with US military and is not civilian.  They are based in the wilderness in North Carolina.  They are highly trained mercenaries which are controlled by intelligence agencies and the upper echelons of the White House.  25,000 Blackwater troops have been unleashed in Iraq and are responsible for looting and destroying ancient Sumerian sites and caused irrevsible damage to numerous other sites and are responsible for merciless killings of civilian Muslims.  They patroled the streets of New Orleans after hurricane Katrina  They are free of the constraints of International Rules of War and do as they are commanded by intelligence agencies and BUSH.  They are funded by MULTIMILLIONARE RIGHT WING CHRISTIAN RADICALS.
