  <description>Every day a beach suffers the adverse effects of reckless trash and waste disposal. Every month a beach is closed because polluted water makes the ocean unsafe to enter. Every year a coastline recedes a bit more from overdevelopment and erosion.

Had enough? Want to help stem this negative tide? Get involved with Project Blue.

Here&#8217;s the deal: You buy specially designed, exclusive Project Blue gear you want, like clothing and accessories, from our participating partners, on www.betruetoblue.com

They donate part of the proceeds to fund coastline protection initiatives nationwide.

The math is easy: You buy. Your beach wins.

1. keep the ocean clean and safe

2. keep the beach clean and safe

3. keep the waves clean and safe

4. you buy.your beach wins</description>
