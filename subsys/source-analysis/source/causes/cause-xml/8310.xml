  <description>What i normaly say it only starts of small but it grows if someone sees u doing a good deed then other may follow. What i hate doing is litter my country. So i wait to throw whatever is in my hand into the dustbin even if its not around. u could put a bag in ur car and the litter in there so when u get home, u cud put the litter bag in the kitchen garbage can. tell ur drivers or anyone around u to do the same. Spread the word amongs u and lets c what happens. i've told my driver, my mum and now they have a bag in the car to use for litter:) that makes me happy.
