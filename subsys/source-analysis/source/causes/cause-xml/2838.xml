  <description>You've all seen the commercials for "Feed The Children."  It makes you cry when you see children go to sleep.... HUNGRY!  You can see the need for food in their eyes.  It's absolutely heartbreaking.  The purpose of this group is to greatly reduce hunger in countries, such as Kenya, and to prevent the children from looking in the garbage for food scraps by offering them nutritious meals on a daily basis.  Don't waste time by sitting around.  Contribute, for the children's sake.

1. The children WILL be fed.

2. NO child shall go to sleep hungry.

3. The children don't deserve to starve!</description>
