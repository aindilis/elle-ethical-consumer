  <description>In this modern world of miracle medical cures,cheap chinese imports and flavoured waters(doesnt that make it a cooldrink) It saddens me to know that there are still Men,women and alas even little children who are being subjected to the ancient and troubling curse of the mullet.

How this despicable practise continues today has troubled me greatly and woken me from my sleep many times soaked in a terrible sweat. 

My body feels sometimes too wracked to continue...but I must,For the sake of our future we need to eradicate world mullet abuse.

Lets join hands and stamp out the mullet once and for all.
