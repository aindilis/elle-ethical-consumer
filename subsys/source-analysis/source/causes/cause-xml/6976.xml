  <description>From visionary to entrepreneur, from family man to good friend, Augie Nieto has touched the lives of many in a multitude of ways. He is one of the most successful innovators in the U.S. fitness industry. 
At the age of 19, Augie bought the marketing rights to the Lifecycle exercise bike. Then in 1980, he co-founded Lifecycle, Inc., and over the next 20 years, the company, now called Life Fitness, Inc., repeatedly multiplied in size under his leadership and grew to be the largest commercial manufacturer of fitness equipment in the world. 
Augie currently serves as chairman of Octane Fitness, and as an operating advisor to North Castle Partners. He is on the boards of several companies, including Grand Expeditions and Quest Software. 
The Orange County, California, native earned a degree in economics with an emphasis in financial accounting from Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, California. Augie is a dedicated husband and father to his wife, Lynne, and their four children. 
In March 2005, Augie was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Drawing strength from his family, friends and a flood of supportive e-mails, Augie maintains a positive attitude and continues to lead an active life.
