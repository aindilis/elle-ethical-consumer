  <description>I, Andrew have not been allowed to get my permit becuase of my current acidemic situation. I have a 3.2 gpa and i belive that i have proven to my mom that i am resposible (which is why i can't get my permit). And I know that I am a more suitible driving member of society than many of the other teens i know. So, if you would like to join me in my quest to get my permit through facebook, go right ahead.

1. Get Andrew Permit.

2. ASAP.

3. Maybe a sweet ride, if time permits.</description>
