  <description>Our borders need to be protected. It&#8217;s too easy for people to cross the border and some of those people may want to do use harm. The borders are one of our most vulnerable areas of this country. I love this country and I do not want anything to happen to it. There are ways to protect this country and we should start at the borders. Secure the borders from those who would do use harm.

The holes in Americas borders are key access points for those with radical ideologies that wish to do our family and friends harm.

God Bless those that keep us safe. Support the troops and keep them in your thoughts and prays.
