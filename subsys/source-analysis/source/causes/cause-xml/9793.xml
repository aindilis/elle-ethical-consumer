Hi Everyone!

For each $5 donation one makes to Special Olympics New York, a rubber racing duck will be adopted in their name and entered into the race with a chance to win one Million Dollars, and other great prizes. These cool little ducks will race from the Brooklyn Bridge to the South Street Seaport as thousands cheer them on. 

To join the excitement and adopt a duck go to: http://www.2007duckrace.kintera.org

To adopt a duck online is quick and easy. Click on the website above for the Million Dollar Duck Race Homepage. (If for some reason the url above is not clickable you can copy and paste it into your browser url bar). 

Good Luck!
