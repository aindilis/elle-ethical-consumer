  <description>We love big dogs, and hate cats.

1. Cats suck because they MAKE you work for their affection, which blows.

2. Cats suck, because they are never around.

3. Small dogs suck, because they bark like idiots.

4. Little dogs suck, because they bark like mice (and it's annoying.)</description>
