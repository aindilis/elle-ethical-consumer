  <description> As we pass just another regular day, millions of people in Bangladesh pass the day starving, struggling and ailing! Even a little help from us can make a significant difference in the lives of Bangladeshis. It can change their lives forever! And as we help one more of them, Bangladesh takes a little step towards prosperity and self-reliance.

With this mission, SpaandanB (pronounced spon-don bee) started its journey in early 1998. A small group of expatriate Bangladeshis in the San Francisco Bay Area founded this nonprofit charitable organization with financial help from generous donors. SpaandanB supports small-scale projects in Bangladesh in the areas of education, health and development. Since its inception, SpaandanB has funded several projects and has helped hundreds of Bangladeshi lead a better life.
