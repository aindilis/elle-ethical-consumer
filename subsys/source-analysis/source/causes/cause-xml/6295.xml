  <description>On April 17, 2006, Golden State Warriors fans were surprised to see that their team had taken a full page advertisement out of local newspapers to apologize for not making the playoffs.  This rare campaign was initiated and substantively paid for by Jason Richardson, a Warrior fan favorite since his arrival 6 years ago. 

Last week, Jason was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats.  As a gesture of appreciation for his dedication to the community and team, a few of us have banded together to raise enough money to challenge the local newspapers to take out a full page ad in the papers on the day of his return to the Bay Area as a Charlotte Bobcat.   The funds we raise will be donated to the Warriors Foundation.   The aim of the advertisement is to acknowledge Jason Richardson's contributions to the Warriors community and to generate publicity for the charities involved.  

Please show your support by donating or helping us spread the word.
