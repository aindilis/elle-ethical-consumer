  <description>AAS been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports (track and field, weightlifting, bodybuilding, shot put, cycling, baseball, wrestling, Mixed Martial Arts, boxing, football, etc.) to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury. Steroid use to obtain competitive advantage is prohibited by the rules of the governing bodies of many sports. However, steroids are also used by many non-professional athletes to enhance physical performance, and are also widely used by amateur bodybuilders to enhance physical appearance.

In an athletic or body-building context, steroid commonly refers to anabolic steroids. Anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) are a class of natural and synthetic steroid hormones that promote cell growth and division, resulting in growth of several types of tissues, especially muscle and bone. Different anabolic androgenic steroids have varying combinations of androgenic and anabolic properties, and are often referred to in medical texts as AAS (anabolic/androgenic steroids). Testosterone is the most potent natural anabolic androgenic steroid, while dihydrotestosterone is the most potent natural androgen.
