  <description>If anyone is truly interested in the rebirth and renewal of the truly cultured city of New Orleans and its surrounding areas, then this is definately a cause worth fighting for. The children truly are our future. Adults and elders should take the time to recognize that children need attention, and sometimes its more than just a phone call in passing or a conversation made in a rush. The city can truly be a great place to raise families and to live if just enough attention is paid to our brightest hope for an opportunistic future- the kids. Please consider joining my cause. I truly think that it just takes one, but if many support, I think I can get this non-profit organization could get off the ground in the near future. Check back for updates!
