  <description>The Tax-Free Teachers Movement is a movement to increase the benefits for professional educators. Teachers are woefully underpaid and disrespected throughout the country and the world. 

School districts are often cash-strapped and would have difficulty paying teachers more  or providing better benefits in many cases. However, by making teachers tax-exempt, you in effect "raise" their pay and benefits by taking away the tax burden without causing school districts additional financial hardship. 

Tax-free teaching would also entice other highly qualified potential teachers to enter the field instead of other higher-paying jobs, and decrease the amount of quality teachers who leave education due to the poor pay and benefits.

1. Teachers provide an important service to this country yet are not compensated according to their value.

2. Teacher pay will never be equal to their value, but removing the tax burden from teachers can help close the gap.

3. Removing the tax burden from teachers will enhance the profession, and entice more of the best and brightest to enter the field or stay in the field.</description>
