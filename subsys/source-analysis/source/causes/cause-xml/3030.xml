  <description>Did you know fraternity and sorority alumni make up:
30% of Fortune 500 Executives
48% of all US Presidents
40% of all US Supreme Court Justices 
30% of the US Congress
42% of the US Senate
10% of people listed in &#8220;Who&#8217;s Who in America&#8221;

Only 3% of the US population is Greek!


Greek InterVarsity's Goals:
To reach an entirely unique culture, that has historically been closed off and condemned as pagan, with the gospel message.

To empower Greek students to live a life of obedience, to walk personally with the Lord, to study His Word, and to share Jesus with their friends.

To equip students, who will become          tomorrow's leaders and parents, how to make Jesus Christ ruler of every part of their lives and how to share the gospel in their communities, careers and families.

Since 1991, over 8000 students from 130 schools and 35 states have been impacted by this ministry!


1. Our vision is to see Greek students transformed, the Greek system renewed and world changers developed.</description>
