  <description>Founded in 1991, by former Paul Taylor dancers Denise Roberts Hurlin and Hernando Cortez, Dancers Responding to AIDS (DRA) is a fundraising program of Broadway Cares / Equity Fights AIDS (BC/EFA), the nation&#8217;s leading industry-based AIDS fundraising and grant-making organization. The funds that DRA raises are distributed to over 450 AIDS and Family Service Organizations across the United States and to six programs of The Actors Fund &#8211; including The Phyllis Newman Women&#8217;s Health Initiative, Al Hirschfeld Free Health Clinic and newly founded Dancers&#8217; Resource. 

DRA raises money in many ways including organizing audience appeals during the seasons of professional dance companies, student fundraising through DRA's Dance Student Outreach Project, and by producing events - Dance From the Heart, Dancing at the Crossroads and DRA's signature Fire Island Dance Festival.

Since its founding in 1988, BC/EFA has raised over 140 million dollars for much needed services.

1. DRA is the dance community's response to an ongoing health crisis.

2. All of the money we distribute goes directly to services, NOT to medical research.

3. By using the talents and dedication of dance community members of all ages, we truly make a difference in the lives of countless individuals.</description>
