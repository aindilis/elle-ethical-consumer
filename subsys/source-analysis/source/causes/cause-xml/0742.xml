  <description>Dachshunds are one of the most popular and wonderful dogs.  Unfortunately, as is the case with many popular animals these dogs are over-bred, and in many cases, are not taken care of properly.  There are so many of these dogs and their protectors that need your help with medical bills and finding a forever home.  All money donated goes directly to Dachshund Rescue of North America.  An organization that I can guarantee is making a difference.

1. Dachshunds are wonderful animals who need our protection.

2. All of these animals deserve the ability to live a fulfilling life.

3. Dachshunds, through overbreeding (and other factors), are especially prone to genetically based health problems, thus they are especially in need of financial support for medical bills.</description>
