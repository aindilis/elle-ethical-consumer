  <description>Local charity started in 1992 in Porth, Mid Glamorgan, South Wales. 

Volunteer helpers humanely trap and spay feral cats, and injured cats/dogs. We rehome as many as possible but sadly most people will not take adult cats, and want kittens. In those cases the volunteers add to their own expanding cat families!

Fosterers, adopters and financial support always needed. Cheques by post to :-
