  <description>Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which one or more organ systems in the body accumulate deposits of abnormal proteins known as amyloid. The name "amyloidosis" was first used more than 100 years ago, but cases were described over 300 years ago. However, only within the past 25 years have physicians understood the specific make-up and structure of amyloid proteins. Although amyloidosis is not cancer, it is very serious. It is disabling and is potentially life threatening.

1. Promoting disease awareness in all communities so it can be recognized earlier and appropriately treated.

2. Supporting valuable research projects</description>
