  <description>We'll achieve this through pioneering research, vital prevention activity and ensuring quality care and support for everyone living with heart disease.
There are over 260 BHF Heart Nurses caring for patients across the UK. 
Over 1,620 Heartstart UK schemes teach people what to do in an emergency. More than 1.2 million people have been trained by Heartstart UK in schools and the community. 
The BHF invests over &#163;100 a minute on research to keep the nation's hearts healthy.  PLEASE KINDLY NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND ANY POST RELATED TO IT WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED!
