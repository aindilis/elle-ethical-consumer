  <description>Barrow is suffering under a plague of seagulls. They have been known to attack innocent civilians in the street and steal burgers from paying customers outside McDonalds. not to mention the infernal noise they make 24/7. most birds shut up at night and start singing in the morning. seagulls never go to sleep. the residents of barrow island are being driven mad by the continuous skwaking of the seagulls. what do we pay ou taxes for? barrow is a town with an infestation. what is the local government going to do about it?

Barrow council wonders why people are leaving the area in droves - i give you an answer - seagulls!

for god sake do something about it - we all pay our concuil tax - we deserve better!

1. Seagulls destroy our quality of life

2. You'll feel better without seagulls

3. Seagulls are arrogant and need to be knocked down a few pegs</description>
