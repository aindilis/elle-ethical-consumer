  <description>Esophageal cancer is an aggressive form of cancer.  Because it is usually diagnosed in later stages, the 5 year survival rate is around 25%.
Men are more often affected by this disease, and some of the symptoms include:  trouble swallowing, painful swallowing and weight loss.
If you have any of these symptoms, or have had a history of heartburn, please see your doctor as soon as you can!

1. We need to cure cancer, NOW!  

2. We need to make people aware of this disease, that it exists, and that early detection is key.

3. We need to teach people about prevention strategies.  Among the risk factors are the frequent use of alcohol, and the use of tobacco.</description>
