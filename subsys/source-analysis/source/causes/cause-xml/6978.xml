  <description> Gamescrewage affects us all. Its pervasive devastation can be felt far and wide; an omnipresent force of malice and misfortune. It descends upon you at the worst possible moments, landing you in impossible situations. To good luck, it is the ninja of death. To the gamer, it is your ally dropping three seconds into the game. To the human race it is an Earth-killing asteroid out of nowhere. If God and the devil were to fight, Gamescrewage would be the rock God tripped over. For those of you who understand the true magnitude of the horror that may be wrought by gamescrewage, or for those of you who just get screwed all the time at the worst possible moments, this cause is for you.
