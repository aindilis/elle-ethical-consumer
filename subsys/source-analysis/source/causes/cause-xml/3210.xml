  <description>I believe that this is an up and coming new bacteria or virus and we should be aware of its complexity. It does not have a cure it isnt even a disease, but the  Americans are Researching as is the  British Columbia University. I believe this particular disease needs to be out there in order to  educate the people. I was a Health Care Worker who came in comtact with a client  who had this  disease and was not informed by my Employer of the Clients disease, I now have  this and let me tell you the  anguish I have been going through this last year not to mention my immediate family's torment and misunderstanding and Drs. Who do not go outside there box to help  me .I shouldn't be to upset with these Drs who "reach" for some rediculous diagnose. Remember, it's a short reach to the corners of a narrow mind! I will not let this beat me down I'm a positive person and I will make  sure  that the  public and doctors are  aware of this ongoing disease! read a story from some sites
