  <description>This cause does not debate (reject-accept) on the Armenian claims about what happened in Anatolia in WWI, but seeks for international recognition of the massacres by the Armenian gangs that were supported by the Russian Army.

Hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians, including Turkish, Kurdish, and Jewish peoples of Eastern Anatolia were killed by Armenian Army. Not much research done on the se victims who were making up the Anatolia's Muslim and Jewish populations. This needs to be addressed in order to attract the attention of researchers to reveal this dark part of history.

1. Russia supported Armenian Army killed hundreds of thousand of Muslims of Anatolia.

2. This should be recognised as a genocide against the muslim population.</description>
