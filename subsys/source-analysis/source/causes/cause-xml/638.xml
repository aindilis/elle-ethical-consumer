  <description>Tim here. You might already know that I'm participating in the AIDS Walk Boston this year but just in case you don't, here are a few details.

I set myself a goal of $1500 so please please keep supporting me and spread the word about my walk for AIDS.

I NEED YOUR SUPPORT!


Each dollar you donate can help the AIDS Action Committee stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

You'll be supporting their vital prevention, education and direct services to people living with HIV. Private dollars also fund 100% of AAC's public policy efforts, both at the State House in Boston, as well as on Capitol Hill in Washington.

Thank you for supporting me always, but especially in this challenge; you really can make a difference!
