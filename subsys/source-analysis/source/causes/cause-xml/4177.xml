  <description>Rapport primarily provides individual, family, and group counselling for adolescents and young adults experiencing personal, social, or familial challanges. Clients seen at Rapport are typically between 12 and 20 years of age, and are either residing, attending school or working in the Region of Peel. All services at Rapport are provided on a voluntary and confidential basis, with clients being seen at one of Rapport&#8217;s three office locations or in a variety of community settings.

Rapport offers two distinct counselling programs. Youth aged 12-15 years old facing imminent risk of leaving home, and indicating reluctance to engage in counselling, may be eligible for the Counselling Program for Families at Risk. Young persons aged 12-20 years old requiring counselling assistance may be eligible for the more generic Youth Counselling Program. 

At Rapport we believe in &#8220;Happier Youth&#8221; will lead to &#8220;Healthier Communities&#8221;.
