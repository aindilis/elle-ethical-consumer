  <description>throughout human history, nearly every major war, every human conflict that has resulted in death, was the result of greed. Sometimes the greed was directly related to some kind of indespicable act, as in someone wanting something so much they have killed and destroyed to get it. And sometimes it is not directly related, such as a boss giving his employees less in order to gain more, at the employee's expense. I am a firm believe that all human conflict can be eliminated by eliminating any kind of greedy impulse from ones own nature. When a human is willing to sacrifice someone else's well being, in order to furthur oneself, that person has violated an unspoken law that as a human, we cannot deal with. We will find you greedy bastards, and we will hunt you down like the assholes you are, drug you up on incredible amounts of LSD, and watch your mind slowly deteriorate. or if you have a better suggestion, please write Alex Van Dyne Goodbye greed.
