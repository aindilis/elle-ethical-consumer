  <description>Hello, my name is Mike Jones.
I like to sing.
I like to sing so much, I plan to make it my career.
I like to sing jazz, I like to sing essentially anything asside from country or R&amp;B.
I'm looking for a band, but it's hard for me to practice with bands without proper equipment, which is why I am asking you to find a way to make some form of contribution to my cause.
I would pony up for my own, if I had the money or the means.  As a Chem. Engineering student in college I won't have time to have a job that will create excess income enough for me to purchase a PA.
Equipment, advice, or funds are always helpful. 
If you can't contribute one of these, at least invite others to this group. The more that know, the more that I might reach.

If you worry that you'd be wasting your help on me, I, and my local reputation can assure you that this is a valid plea.

I will post pictures with receipts and gear as proof

Half of the proceeds will be given to a Kansas City Music charitee of my choice.

1. I love to rock.

2. I wanna rock.

3. I've gotta rock!</description>
