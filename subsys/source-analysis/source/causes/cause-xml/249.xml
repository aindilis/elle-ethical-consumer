Rocking Out For A Cause is a series of semiannual benefit concerts held for the victims of genocide in Darfur, Sudan in Africa.

 All of the proceeds are sent, through Save The Children, to the region of Darfur in Sudan.

We have had three successful  concerts so far, two held in Fairfield, CT and one in Hamden. Our next show is on July 20th, 2007, at The Space on 295 Treadwell Street in Hamden, CT. Tickets can be bought at the door.

**we're considering networking ROFAC shows - it could be very exciting, and we could make a ton of money

if you want to help out, email us at rockingoutforacause@gmail.com and we'll work something out
