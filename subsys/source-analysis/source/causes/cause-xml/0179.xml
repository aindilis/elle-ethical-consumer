  <description>As his friends know, Randall is very into urban development and architecture, having spent the last year in Beijing doing urban development.  He has been wanting to get in touch with the non-profit "Architects for Humanity" for years now, and today after the causes application launched on Facebook, they e-mailed him out of the blue.  Since I pulled Randall away from his true calling in architecture, let's use his new passion of working with non-profits help his passion for architecture.  This non-profit is doing especially amazing work in rebuilding New Orleans.  

1. Randall Winston is an amazing human being

2. New Orleans is a national architectural treasure and needs to be restored to its former glory</description>
