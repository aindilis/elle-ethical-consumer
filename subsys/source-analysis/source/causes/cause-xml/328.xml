  <description>Promote Africa, Inc is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that supports health, educational, and capacity building community development projects in Namibia by funding them with our Bright Ideas Grants.

We ask these communities with on-the-ground insights into daily challenges and hidden opportunities otherwise inaccessible to submit their own ideas for real potential solutions. With relevance and long-lasting community support built into the model, we are then able to apply our own evaluation criteria and provide seed capital to the very best of projects. 


&gt;&gt;NEW PROJECTS! ((www.BrightIdeasGrant.com))
Include micro-enterprises to generate income and funds for community health/education, computer education for preschoolers and unemployed youth, and educational resource centres for children without local libraries.
