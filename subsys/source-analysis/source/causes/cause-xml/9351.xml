  <description>People all over the world are constantly in conflict. Indeed, peace is an aberition in human history. Unfortunately, many existing nations and people are inconvenient for the interests of you and I as Americans and as human beings.

The simplest solution is to remove these nations and people from existance. As we've learned over the course of our last two occupations of nations, it is quite hard to make a person you've invaded like you. In fact, they are very likely to kill you (or, at the least, make some sort of incompetent and barbaric attept).

Better to avoid their attempts and any dealings with them. Instead, let us persuade them, and if diplomacy fails, drop great quantities of ordinance on their homes. When the common folk are so tired of the bombing that the government must stop being inconvenient or troublesome, the conflict will be resolved. 

1. There are many peoples in the world.

2. Some of them mean you and I harm.

3. Others are simply inconvenient.

4. The United States has the largest stockpile of weapons in history.

5. The use of these weapons would make life easier for the average citizen.

6. We are against the invasion of any sovereign peoples.

7. We just want to bomb the above peoples until they cease any inconveniences or malices toward us.</description>
