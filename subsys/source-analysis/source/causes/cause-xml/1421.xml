  <description>For more than three years, ongoing violence has devastated the remote western region of Sudan known as Darfur. Conflicts between tribal militias have left over 400,000 dead and 2.5 million displaced, living in temporary camps where conditions are harsh and food is scare. Fighting has reduced villages to ashes, crops to barren fields. The humanitarian crisis is only getting worse: 2500 people die each week, the camps are full far beyond their capacity, and UN peace keepers have been prohibited from intervening.
