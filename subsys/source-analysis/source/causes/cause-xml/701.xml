  <description>While there exist greater linkages today between nations and peoples than our planet has ever known, we see all around us an ever-increasing divide between the rich and poor. Young people have the limitless potential to bridge this divide and work toward a shared vision of human dignity, freedom and basic security. We envision a world where the worth of every human being is affirmed and globalization works for all--especially the poor and marginalized.

2. It is unjust that some should be poor simply by accident of birth

3. We must address failures in Trade, Debt, and Health Policies to end Global Poverty</description>
