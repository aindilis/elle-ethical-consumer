  <description>A forum and website based in Australia is doing its bit to create some central areas for artists of all walks to get together and share their pain and the stories and people involved with causing an artist to suffer.

Please recommend this to friends of yours who work in the arts; musicians, artists, painters, sculptures, computer graphics designers, circus performers, actors. 

Knowledge is power  -so let us share our knowledge.
