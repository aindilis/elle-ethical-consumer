  <description>Raising money to purchase water filtration systems in villages in developing countries, such as Benin, in Africa. We recently raised over $500 to buy one from our school, and also bought a goat for a village in Egypt. This was in coalition with Plan Canada, formerly Foster Parents Plan. We would, however like to continue our work when we want to and with whom we want to.  

1. Everyone is entitled to clean water

2. Nobody should have to walk miles to find water

3. People to in developed countries have an obligation to help those in developing countries</description>
