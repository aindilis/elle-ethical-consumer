  <description>This place was started in this lady's garage.  She saw a need for these foser parents who are given these children at all hours of the day with nothing but the clothes they are wearing.  This organization receives donations in ways of money, clothes, toys, and education materials to send to these foster parents and the particular child.  The parent fills out a little sheet of paper and each child is given a few outfits and toys.  Volunteering there is amazing because you can play with the babies that come in.  Yes, babies, children from 3 months to 18yrs are benefited by this place.  Foster children in over 155 Georgia counties in 2006 were provided for.
