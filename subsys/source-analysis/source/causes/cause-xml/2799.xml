"We the students of the New Rochelle education system are living in a changing, technological world. Everyday, most of us have access to a computer. Many times, this access is necessary in order to provide a better learning experience, however the school district's AUP (Internet acceptable use policy) prevents us from accessing sites vital to our chosen path, such as information for a research paper, file storage for transfer of files between home and school, and even communicating with the outside world to collaborate with other schools to further our education. This group petitions much of the AUP and the signee's think that it should be revised with students AND teachers AND faculty AND representative from the board of education present to accurately reflect opinions on what is appropriate and what is not."

Recently, someone, was called to the vice-principal's office to be talked about their own proxy, used for their AP Computer Science class for getting information FOR A CLASS. The following news article pretty much explains it for a different student, except that they weren't suspended.
