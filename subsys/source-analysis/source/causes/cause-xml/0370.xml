  <description>Most kids(up to age 18) do not understand the dangerous effects of tobacco. We need to help educate others on how tobacco can harm a person's life; both mentally and physically. And also how it is harmful to everyone around the smoker. Convincing youth not to smoke is one of the greatest impacts we can have on their life.

1. Convince kids not to smoke.

2. Help kids(and also adults) to quit smoking.</description>
