------     THAT IS HOW WE GET CREDIT TOWARDS OUR FUNDRAISING CHALLENGE.     ------ Check the video &lt;a href="http://indyvoter.org/league-a-thon" target="_blank"&gt;"Are You The Movement"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

When we found out that we had lost nearly a third of our budget in funding we were hit hard with a fact we already knew: we can&#8217;t depend on big funders to build our movement. If we are this movement, we need to own this movement.&lt;br /&gt;

So we're asking you to step up right now and throw down to make the League a sustainable movement.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;* Run your own little &lt;a href="http://indyvoter.org/league-a-thon" target="_blank"&gt;League-a-Thon&lt;/a&gt; fundraiser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;* or just &lt;a href="http://indyvoter.org/iam" target="_blank"&gt;donate right now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;* Or come to our &lt;a href="http://indyvoter.org/art" target="_blank"&gt;art auction in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; on Friday June 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;* Or host a fundraiser event in your town...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;* Or get down with your local League...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;* Or get creative and let us know what you're doing...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
