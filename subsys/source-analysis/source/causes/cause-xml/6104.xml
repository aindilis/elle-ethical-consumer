  <description>Chinese Cresteds are a unique breed to say the least.   Most do not know that the Chinese Crested actually comes in 2 varieties the sort with hair, the powderpuff, and the hairless.  As with most hairless dogs the first thing that pops into most people's mind is "why the heck would someone want a hairless dog".  Well we are out there. People do love &amp; care for these hairless dogs which often take more care than there hairy counterparts.  So help the Nekkid.  They need loving homes too!

We are raising funds for:
Hope's Haven- http://www.hopeshaven.org/

Other Chinese Crested Rescues:

Crest-Care- http://www.crest-care.com/

Rocky Mountain Chinese Crested Rescue- http://www.rmccr.org/

For those in the UK: http://www.angelfire.com/super2/chinesecrestedrescue/home.html

A donation to any of these fine rescues is greatly appreciated. 

1. Dogs should not have to suffer without homes.  Help those who rescue and save those animals in need. </description>
