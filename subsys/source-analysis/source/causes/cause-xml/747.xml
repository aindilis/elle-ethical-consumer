  <description>GLBT Speaks aims to promote "Advocacy Through Education".

We are a Speaking and Advocacy agency aimed at GLBT issues and HIV/AIDS.

Whether it is presenting programs on GLBT and HIV/AIDS issues or coming to your office/campus/organization to help develop a safe space program, GLBT Speaks hopes that you will consider us your advocate and help us spread the message of &#8220;Advocacy Through Education.&#8221;

We also support other positive GLBT causes in completing their mission as long as it is similar to ours.

1. Advocacy is accomplished through education.

2. Hate is taught, and can be untaught. 

3. Understanding and acceptance comes through hard work and dedication.</description>
