  <description>The term women&#8217;s rights typically refers to freedoms inherently possessed by women and girls of all ages, which may be institutionalized or ignored and/or illegitimately suppressed by law or custom in a particular society. These liberties are grouped together and differentiated from broader notions of human rights because they often differ from the freedoms inherently possessed by and/or recognized for men and boys, and because activism surrounding this issue claims an inherent historical and traditional bias against the exercise of rights by women.

Feminism and most modern sociological theory maintain that the differences between men and women are, at least in part, socially constructed 'differences' , (i.e. determined through history by specific human groups), rather than biologically determined, immutable conditions. 

"Feminism isn't about Equality; It's about the women who gave their lives so you could have one.  It's about reprieve."

1. Women are equal to men,  Just as men are equal to women

2. Women accross the globe should be awarded their rights as individuals

3. No Man OR Woman can legally take away the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuits of happiness simply based on gender</description>
