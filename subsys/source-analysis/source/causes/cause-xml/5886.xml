  <description>hello every one ive noticed that there alot of religions going around this world and they all seems to have something wronge with every single one. (yes ive looked into this) i am hoping to create a brand new religion which i would like to call "Wellerism" i have many story's to tell but i want to wait and see how many people are intrested in joining a new religion. i do understand that alot of people are very wary of what a new religion can bring to there life. i cant tell u thats it going to bring u closer to god. but i can tell you that it will bring u closer to the people around u, and to your self. if you are intrested in joining a new religion and hearing intresting storys. please join my cause and RECRUIT RECRUIT RECRUIT storys will start showing up after 100 people join and more and more will come when the team moral gets higher and higher. thank u for reading this and i hope to see alot more recruits in time come.

yours truely,
