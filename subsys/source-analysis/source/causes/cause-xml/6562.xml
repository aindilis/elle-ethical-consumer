  <description>Mission Year is a year long urban ministry program focused on Christian service and discipleship. 

We take teams of people (18 and older), place them in an area of need, and help them to serve people and create community. 

We are committed to the command of Jesus to &#8220;love God and love people,&#8221; by placing the needs of our neighbors first and developing committed disciples of Christ with a heart for the poor.

1. We seek to build deep relationships based on trust and respect with neighbors, seeking practical ways to show Christian love.

2. We work for justice by identifying individual and corporate abuses of power and fighting against them.

3. We volunteer at social service agencies that are providing vital resources to the poor.</description>
