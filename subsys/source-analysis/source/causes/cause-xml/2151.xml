  <description>Retinoblastoma is a cancer of the retina and only effects children under the age of seven.
Retinoblastoma can be detected at an early stage by not eliminating red eye in your photos.  If your childs eye reflects white and not red I would recomend getting your child checked out.  But do not panic.
