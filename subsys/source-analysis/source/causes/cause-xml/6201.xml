  <description>Support My Journey

What a great cause!

I'm doing this for all the ladies in my life.

Breast cancer affects 1 woman out every 9 in Canada alone. 85% of breast cancer patients only live for maximum of 5 years after they've been diagnosed. Let's put an end to this disease!

The Weekend to End Breast Cancer is a two-day, 60-kilometre walk through the neighbourhoods of Toronto.

Proceeds benefit Princess Margaret Hospital, funding important breast cancer research, education, services and care.

Thank you for your donations and the support in the fight against cancer!
