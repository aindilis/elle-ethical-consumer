  <description>Kingdon is a developer for Tuesday Studios.  Currently rent is paid through the end of October and there is still some money in the bank.  Having not yet worked the books, I suggest that it may be necessary to decide between Apartment and Car before the coming end of October.

Other expenses covered in the plan include gasoline, car payments, car insurance, health insurance, groceries, internet, hardware maintenance, and probably some other things.

1. More debt is not helpful to the cause, unless it is backed with a fair equity.

2. You cannot live in Rochester in the winter without a car.

3. Jobs on the Internet are superior to jobs that require an expense of postage or gasoline.

4. Kingdon should be fluent in both Arabic and Mandarin Chinese.

5. Resources on the Internet are sufficient to study Mandarin Chinese independently.</description>
