The mission of Save the Children is to create lasting, positive change in the lives of children in need. Save the Children works to achieve this mission through community-based programs designed to ensure sustained improvements and benefits for children, families and communities.

Save the Children works in more than 40 countries around the world, including the United States. Development programs focus on improving basic conditions and potential futures for children through basic education for girls and boys, maternal and child health services and income generating opportunities. In countries experiencing emergencies, political upheaval, war, or violence, Save the Children helps provide protection and long-term recovery. In nearly 200 sites throughout the United States, Save the Children focuses on improving literacy, nutrition and physical activity, during and after school, for children and youth of rural poverty.
