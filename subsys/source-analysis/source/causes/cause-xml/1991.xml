  <description>ONE day a month starting June 22nd, Five Four staff members will be making a commitment to use an alternative form of transportation to offset global
warming and help preserve the environment.  We will either walk, bike or use public transportation to get to and from work.  Five Four is also asking for
other environmentally conscious participants to take action and be involved with our cause.
 
Five Four employees will be taking a photo of themselves taking alternate forms of transportation for that day.  All images will be posted on the Five
Four website to showcase the efforts of everyone who gets involved in order to make a difference.  We strongly encourage anyone else who is participating outside of Five Four staff, to send in their photos of their day's journey helping to preserve our environment.


1. To preserve our environment.

2. To fight against global warming.

3. To set an example through leading by example.</description>
