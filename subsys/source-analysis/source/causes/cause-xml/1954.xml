  <description>Refugees are those forced to flee their home countries in fear of the loss of their lives or liberty based on their race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. Up to 70,000 refugees are invited by the United States government every year to start a new life in this country.  

Join us as we support refugees from all over the world as they face this daunting task. 

We started as a student club and now, as an independent nonprofit organization, we continue to utilize youth leadership and community volunteerism in making positive impacts in the lives of refugee individuals. 

1. Provide guidance to refugee families during their first months in a new country 

2. Mentor refugee youth in their aspirations toward higher education 

3. Engage the community in refugee issues both locally and globally

4. Cultivate the next generation of leaders to value cultural exchange </description>
