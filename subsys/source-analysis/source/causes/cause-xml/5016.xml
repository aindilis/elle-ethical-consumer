  <description>We believe in education&#8217;s ability to transform the lives of children and their families. Because extreme poverty prevents them from getting an education, many children grow up without hope. The Sunrise Foundation, Inc. works with children and parents to help them access school, nutrition, medical care and support through our center in Camoapa, Nicaragua. We seek to accompany these children and families on their journey to a brighter future. 

1. All children deserve access to education, nutrition, and healthcare.

2. Education has the power to transform.

3. The children living in conditions of extreme poverty in Camoapa, Nicaragua deserve better. </description>
