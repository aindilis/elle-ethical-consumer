  <description>Addictions come in many forms. Whether it&#8217;s drugs, alcohol, food, self harm, or any other harmful behavior, addictions can overpower an individual and destroy certain areas of their life. My mission is to start Imagine Tomorrow in hope of raising money to go to treatment centers targeting recovery from addictions. Imagine Tomorrow can provide hope to addicts that there are new chances and opportunities tomorrow, and brighter futures if they persist in their recovery. A lot of times, insurance companies will not cover any form of care or treatment. The individual is left feeling hopeless and alone, either paying out of pocket or not receiving any kind attention. The money raised will focus on educating the individual about their addiction, and supporting and guiding them through the recovery process. With your help, lives will forever be changed through Imagine Tomorrow. 

1. Every person's life is worthwhile, and every person is worthy of receiving treatment for any addiction.

2. Every individual has the power within them to overcome an addiction.</description>
