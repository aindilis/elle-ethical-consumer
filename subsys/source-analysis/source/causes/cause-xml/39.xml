  <description>What would the world look like if everyone believed they could transform society, that they themselves could influence change?  

Let&#8217;s create a world where everyone can be a changemaker.  Let&#8217;s  recognize the power of all people to envision change. Let's work to create a world where each individual has the freedom, confidence, and societal support to address any societal problem and make a positive impact.  

We believe in the power of new ideas and the people behind them. These people are social entrepreneurs, or individuals with innovative solutions to society&#8217;s most pressing social problems.  Social entrepreneurs find what is not working and solve the problem by changing the system, spreading the solution, and persuading entire societies to change.  

Others are encouraged by social entrepreneurs&#8217; energy and commitment, and they see that they, too, can change the world.  Other potential changemakers also realize that there is an entire network of people leading change around the world with whom they can partner and work to end societal problems.
