  <description>Stoked Mentoring is a non-profit action sports mentoring organization with the mission of developing &#8220;Successful Teens with Opportunity, Knowledge, Experience and Determination&#8221; through action sports, mentoring, and coaching.  By bringing together &#8220;at-risk&#8221; youth and successful professional adults to learn a new non-traditional sport (snowboarding, skateboarding, and surfing), Stoked&#8217;s programs serve as the groundwork and means for enhancing mentoring relationships and introduces coaching skills and tools that elicit the best from both parties.

Responsible for developing the curriculum for each mentoring program/season, Stoked recruits and trains program mentors, hand-matches mentor and mentee, manages the mentoring relationship for optimal results and oversees the following post-season relationship. The current programs are targeted towards teens 13 - 18 years old.


1. At Risk Youth today need mentors to help build self esteem and build confidence and to build positive one to one relationships with adults.

2. Many inner city youth don't ever get the chance to skateboard, snowboard, and surf.

3. Resiliency, Determination and Success are key traits that "at risk" youth need to develop to achieve their goals.</description>
