  <description>Mobilize.org was founded in 2002 at UC Berkeley by a group of students fighting rising tuition. Over 10 years, we have grown from a group of 10 students on a campus to a national movement with tens of thousands of Millennials in every state. 

On July 4, 2007 Mobilize.org launched the Democracy 2.0 Campaign, a project to call attention to the ways that our democratic process and institutions were serving and failing to serve the interests of people in our country, specifically the Millennial Generation. The action components of our Democracy 2.0 work include our Democracy 2.0 Summits, awardee support and training and skill building resources, including our Mobilizer&#8217;s Guidebook.

Over the past 4-years, Mobilize.org has organized 10 summits and invested over $150,000 in 34 Millennial-led projects to address issues such as increasing financial literacy for our generation, leveraging new technology to sustain civic engagement and the challenges facing the returning Millennial veterans. 

Mobilize.org is now at a critical juncture in the history, growth and impact of the organization. Over the past eighteen months, Mobilize.org has acquired the staff, programming and assets of three leading non-profit organizations: GenerationEngage, Sparkseed, and YouthNoise. This unprecedented growth has enabled us to provide more resources, tools and trainings to the Millennials we serve, as well as expand our network from 12,000 Millennials to over 50,000. </description>
