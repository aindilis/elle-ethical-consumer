  <description>Mid 2007 i lost my great uncle to smoking. He would always smoke when i was a kid, even inside where all the kids were (me and my cousins). It just wasn't right. So i'm deciding to take a stand. We need to make smoking illegal.

1. Smoking kills

2. Its inconsiderate to smoke around others

3. Smoking doesn't just hurt you, it hurts the people who love you. If you die, they are still going to have to suffer</description>
