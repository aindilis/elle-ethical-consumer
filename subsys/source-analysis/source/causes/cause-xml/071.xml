  <description>Puppy mills are puppy producing facilities that house dogs in poor conditions where they are bred and sold for profit. Many of these dogs are caged for years, bred continuously, and lack social skills because they receive no human companionship. 

Once puppy mill dogs are no longer fertile, they are commonly killed, abandoned, or sold to another puppy mill.  The result of puppy mills is hundreds of thousands of puppies, many with behavior or health problems, and many with little hope of ever being adopted. 

Puppy mills exist because unsuspecting consumers keep buying dogs from pet stores, classifieds, or over the internet. It is up to us to spread the word and educate our friends and family about the reality of puppy mills.
