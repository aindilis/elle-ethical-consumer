  <description>All males are required to register with the Selective Service within 30 days of their 18th birthday or face a fine of up to $250,000 and/or prison for up to 5 years. The Selective Service is the means that this country would conduct a draft, picking random citizens to serve in the military against their will.

The 13th amendment to the United States Constitution states:

1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.


It is unacceptable that our government forces us to register for the possibility of forcing innocent citizens, under penalty of fine and/or prison time, to serve in the military. This is nothing less than involuntary servitude and is unconstitutional, despite what the Supreme Court may think. To force people to register for an unconstitutional practice needs to end. Congress needs to take action and enforce amendment 13, section 2 of the United States Constitution.

1. Forced involuntary servitude of innocent citizens of this country must stop

2. Amendment 13, section 2 to the US Constitution gives Congress the power to stop this practice

3. Congress should uphold the Constitution and put a permanent end to the draft by abolishing the Selective Service</description>
