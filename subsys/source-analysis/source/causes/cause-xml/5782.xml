The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) is a name used internationally by animal liberation activists who engage in direct action on behalf of animals. This includes removing animals from laboratories and fur farms and sabotaging various facilities. According to their public statements, any act that furthers the cause of animal liberation, where all reasonable precautions are taken not to harm human or non-human life, may be claimed as an ALF action.

The ALF is not a group with a membership but an example of a leaderless resistance. ALF activists consider themselves a modern version of the Underground Railroad, the 19th-century anti-slavery network. Activists remove animals from laboratories and farms, arrange safe houses and veterinary care, and operate sanctuaries where animals live out the rest of their lives. Covert cells, active in 42 countries, operate clandestinely, with activists working on a need-to-know basis. A cell might consist of just one person. Robin Webb, who runs the British Animal Liberation Press Office, has said: "That is why the ALF cannot be smashed, it cannot be effectively infiltrated, it cannot be stopped. You, each and every one of you: you are the ALF."
