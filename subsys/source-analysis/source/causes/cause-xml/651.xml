  <description>In Seattle, almost everyone has a story or knows someone with a story from a child at Children's Hospital.  
After losing her young son to inflammatory rheumatism, Anna Clise galvanized 23 female friends and, in 1907, established the first facility west of the Mississippi to specialize in treating children.
One hundred years later, her legacy directs us still: We believe all children should grow up without illness or injury.
That story, and many like it, as well as research efforts require donations from contribution  containers, big fundraisers, help from American Idol and Bothell's own Blake Lewis, or even people who use Facebook. 

1. Dedication and spirit are what drive the legacy of Children's: We believe all children should grow up without illness or injury.

2. Horrible diseases are not something anyone would wish on their worst enemy. The families of these children have been through hell and back and can now tell their personal stories, thanks to generous contributions from people like you, and me. 

3. Our goal is to give more and more parents the gift of seeing their sick child made well. It&#8217;s an aspiration that belongs to all of us. So will the joy of achieving it.</description>
