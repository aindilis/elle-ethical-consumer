  <description>We should test on animals because humans are better. Those animals probably suck anyways. Who cares about rats, or pigs? they both smell. Why not test some random things on animals also? 

1. Keep testing meds on animals.

2. Keep testing new objects on animals.

3. Stop others from stopping us!</description>
