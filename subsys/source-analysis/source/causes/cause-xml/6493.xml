  <description>We need the resources to keep the sport alive! In some ares it is not even recognized as a leisure activity let alone a sport. Bikes are banned from trails and other areas such as skate parks. We need more trails and places to ride!

1. Save the trails 

2. Build stunt areas for the progression of the sport.

3. Support those that participate, just like every other sport.</description>
