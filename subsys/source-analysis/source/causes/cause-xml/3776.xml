  <description>Rebuilding Together Anne Arundel County is a non-profit organization based in Millersville, MD.  Our vision is to repair Anne Arundel County one home at a time.  Through community donations and grants, and with the help of over 500 volunteers, our organization provides totally free home repairs and home modifications to Anne Arundel County's low-income elderly and disabled homeowners.

1. Low-income elderly and disabled homeowners should be able to age in place, without having to be placed in an assisted living facility.

2. Everyone has the right to be warm, safe and dry in their home, regardless of financial status.

3. Through partnerships with local community organizations and businesses, we can repair Anne Arundel County one home at a time.</description>
