  <description>Aids and HIV is something that lives undetected among us. I want everybody to live as safely as possible eventually a way to reverse the effects of aids will be found. I really do believe that, with the intelligence of the world we can help stop the spread of this plague.

As well as the intelligence of the world, there is also an ignorance in the world. People believe myths and urban legends about sex and outcomes of it. 

Nobody has to join this. I don't care. I want to make a difference. It is up the rest to make a difference. "If you could help one person then that person help another, we could move faster than this disease"

1. People must know the effects of HIV/aids not just the causes

2. People must be able to protect themselves from all STD's

3. People must establish morals that help to prevent the spread</description>
