  <description>Ancient coldwater coral habitats are being destroyed by inhumane bottom dragging otter-trawl gear in Canada and through out the world.  The damage done to these long-lived and vital marine ecosystem animals will never recover in our lifetimes.  Almost nothing is known about the tens of thousands of coldwater coral species and their associated habitats that are instantly destroyed by bottom disrupting fishing and petroleum technologies.  Never eat bottom-trawled seafoods in favour of trap-caught and low impact hook and line caught fish products to do your little part.

1. Fish, Seabirds and Whales Need Coldwater Corals

2. Protect Fisheries and Seafood Supplies

3. Promote Humane Fishing Practices

4. Corals use carbon from our biosphere to make their structures</description>
