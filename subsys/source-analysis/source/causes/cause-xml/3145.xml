  <description>CampInteractive (CI) is a not-for-profit organization that empowers at-risk, inner-city youth through the inspiration of the outdoors, and the creative power of technology.

We believe that when urban teenagers step back into nature and forward into technology they gain invaluable skills, heighten their academic standing, and begin to realize more of life's possibilities.
