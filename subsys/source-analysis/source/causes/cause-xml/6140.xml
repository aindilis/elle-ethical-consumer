  <description>Women all over the world have had too much suffrage. It is time that everyone, man, woman, chimp to bond together to accelerate the end to women's suffrage. So please, help stop their suffrage now. If we don't, do you expect your kids to do anything? I mean they barely are able to clean a 70 cu. ft. room, much less help with a cause, so it's up to YOU to help put an end to this injustice.
Note: We are here to educate people.
2nd Note: For those that know me, and are concerned, you may talk to me and I will explain it in depth. Heck even if you don't know me you're welcome to talk with me about it.

1. End Women's suffrage

2. Do you mean you DON'T want to end it?</description>
