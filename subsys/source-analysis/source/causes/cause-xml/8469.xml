  <description>For those who believe in reason, voluntary interaction and free market alternatives to government aggression.

1. Man survives by the use of reason.

2. Fundamentally, the only two forms of human interaction are those based on consent, and coercion.

3. Government, by nature and basic character, survives only by systematic aggression against its populations.

4. Complete abolition of the state, or government is, though not a sufficient condition, a necessary condition towards establishing freedom.

5. No government can be shown to be consistent with individual rights.</description>
