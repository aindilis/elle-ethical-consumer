  <description>I suppose this is a fairly self-explanatory cause: We want to get Corey (AKA Photios) right back into training for the priesthood. Whether you apply yourself through forcing him to put his application in the mail, choosing a location, keeping said application from getting destroyed either via water damage or burger greese, or just simply pestering him endlessly about it (as I do), your aid is highly appreciated. 

We hold this position for a few reasons:

i.) The guy has wanted to be a priest since he was a wee-youngling;

ii.) We just think he's fit for a part in the married Orthodox clergy;

iii.) We love the guy! 

iv.) He's been out of seminary for a few years -- prime time to get back in the game;

v.) We know that he doesn't want to be stuck in the photography department at Walgreens 'til the end of Time.

So, please, help the kid out!

1. We support Photi's quest.

2. Those who strive for the priesthood are worthy of our assistance</description>
