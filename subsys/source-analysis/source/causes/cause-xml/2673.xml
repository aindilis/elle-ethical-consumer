  <description>This cause is to fundraise and put toghether money so that we can all get really drunk on my birthday and have a fun time. My birthday isnt until August 11th but we should start fundraising as so as possible. The idea was that if 10-30 people pitch in 20$ we can either get a texas mickey every 5 people, or every 15 people that pitch in 20$ we can get a keg. 

1. We MUST Get Drunk !

2. We Have The Right 2 Get Drunk !

3. We Will Get Drunk !</description>
