  <description>We are the fans who think it clearly ruthless and unfair to have had Arrested Development pulled off air after only three seasons of sheer brilliance and a huge progressive step in the development of American intellectual comedy.

We are the people who still wear cutoffs to shower and cry when Gob's pre-illusion song comes on the radio.

We will do anything in our power to make Arrested Development a "back on air by popular demand" show. Including sending letters, signing petitions, and getting the producers' attention in any other way we can.

Please support this noble cause.

1. The show was pulled off air unfairly

2. Arrested development has a huge following of fans and people who want it BACK

3. Arrested development should be brought back in the shape of new seasons and new episodes.</description>
