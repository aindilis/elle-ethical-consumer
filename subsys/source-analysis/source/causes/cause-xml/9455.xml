  <description>Robert Gabriel Mugabe KCB (born on February 21, 1924) is the President of Zimbabwe. He has been the head of government in Zimbabwe since 1980, first as Prime Minister and later as first executive President.

He rose to prominence in the 1970s when he led the Zimbabwe African National Union in guerrilla warfare against the white-dominated government of Rhodesia in the Bush War (1964-1979).

The Mugabe administration has been criticized around the world for corruption, suppression of political opposition, mishandling of land reform, economic mismanagement, and deteriorating human rights in Zimbabwe. According to most analysts his administration's policies have led to economic collapse and massive starvation over the course of the last ten years. Zimbabwe has the highest inflation rate in the world expected to hit 1.5 million% by the end of the year, and is, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Africa's worst economic performer. With a record 85% unemployment and 70% interest rates, Zimbabwe is in its worst economic crisis since Mugabe took power.
