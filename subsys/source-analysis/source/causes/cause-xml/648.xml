  <description>No matter how we may feel about the war...one thing we can agree on is how much we appreciate our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas around the world.

Join CSUN Hillel, M-PACT and Compatto: Yarn Salon and learn to knit or crochet (for FREE) a helmet liner, scarf or a pair of boot socks for the troops.
Compatto will collect the finished liners, scarfs and socks and forward them to an organization who will distribute them to the troops.

Materials: You buy 1 skein of Cascade 220 ($6.60) for the helmet liner...or 3 skeins of Mission Falls Super Wash Wool ($6.20 each) for the socks...in the colors permitted by the US Army...and Compatto will supply the patterns. You will also need needles appropriate to the yarn. (No. 7 or 8 for Cascade 220...No. 5 or 6 for the Mission Falls.)

Mention my name and receive a 10% discount on the yarn.

Also, if you would like to arrange a carpool please contact me.

You'll be doing a good thing while meeting new knitters &amp; crocheters. How much better can it get!!

Thanks so much!
