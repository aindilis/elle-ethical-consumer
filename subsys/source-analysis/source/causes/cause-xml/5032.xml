  <description>The Boston Crusaders are dedicated to excellence in the Marching Arts. Our organization is focused on four simple goals: Entertainment, Education, Experience and lastly Competition. We believe that Drum Corps is the perfect vehicle for young adults, because it combines the best of athletics, music and the arts... while still being "very fun".
