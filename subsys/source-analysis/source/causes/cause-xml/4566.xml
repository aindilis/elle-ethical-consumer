  <description>For years, the Cardboard box foundation has found and given away many boxes to the poor, now it is our hope that we can help a boy named Nick Mertens. Please, if anyone could spare some dimes and nickels, do some, he desperately needs them.

1. Nick Mertens deserves a new box.

2. Living in a 2x2 peice of cardboard just isn't suitable.</description>
