  <description>It is time to put an end to the racial ignorance in this country. The United States including its leaders are people who refuse to look at the world through the eyes of another. They see, hear and believe lies and evil and refuse to investigate. For too long individuals make ignorant comments and support unjust and wrong ideals. The evil must be put to an end. For to long people have been oppressed, forced into poverty (becasue of the color of their skin), and hated. The hate must be cleared and the only way for that to happen is if poeople pull down these walls they have built for so long. This country needs to let go of its ethnocentricity and supremacism. This cause represents minorities and the majority alike.

1. People need to live the life of a person of another race.

2. Investigate everything, because racism is still a huge and ongoing issue in America.

3. Let go of the hate, fear, and old beliefs becasue they will keep you ignorant.</description>
