  <description>Support one of the world&#8217;s largest sanctuaries for wild cats (Big Cat Rescue - http://www.bigcatrescue.org.  They provide a permanent retirement home for more than 100 lions, tigers, leopards, cougars, servals, caracals, sand cats, etc., representing 16 of the 35 species of exotic cats.  They are a non-profit organization that provides healthy, enriched environments for the cats to live out their "retirement" years.  Many of these cats have been rescued from fur farms or turned over by Circuses and owners who weren't ready for the responsibility or reality of owning a large cat.

1. People should educate themselves on the responsibilties of owning a wild cat and should take it's natural habitat and physical wellbeing into the upmost consideration when choosing a pet.

2. Circus cats often spend many, many years working in the show and deserve a shot at the way life is supposed to be for them

3. Fur farms are nasty and are not an appropriate method of harvest of fur.  Animals who are exposed to that lifestyle need to be rescued and given a second shot at life.</description>
