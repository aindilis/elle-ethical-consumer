The number of people living with multiple sclerosis increases every hour of every day. This astonishing rate is not going to diminish, nor will it stop, until we've found a cure. Research has made some incredible advances recently, but the world can still only offer disease management drugs and therapies to the 400,000 people living with MS in America.

We've formed a team for the MS Bike Tour, Bike &amp; Hike the Berkshires because we know that riding or hiking is nowhere near as difficult as confronting a lifetime with multiple sclerosis. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society gives us all reason to hope, though. In addition to supporting novel research projects around the globe, they also provide much needed education, programs, and services to everyone who is affected by MS - including the diagnosed, their friends and families, and the healthcare professionals who work with them.

Join our team as a cyclist , hiker or a volunteer! Make a donation online! Send in a check! Talk to your employer about becoming a sponsor of the MS Bike Tour! There are so many ways to make a difference in the fight against MS, and it all begins right here.
