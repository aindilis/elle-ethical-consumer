  <description>My XBOX360 stopped working a week or two after the warantee expired. I called the Microsoft support and they told me I need to send it in and pay $140. I do not have enough money to get that fixed, pay for gas, and other essentials. This tragedy has effected my life and the lives of those close to me. I have developed bi-polar disorder and the common withdrawal symptoms which you may see when a long time smoker tries to quit. Please help my cause to get my XBOX360 fixed.

1. XBOX360 is my medication which keeps me calm and collected.

2. Without it I have nothing better to do except make a cause on facebook to fix it.

3. With it I would not need to drive as much and will save money I need for gas to fix this disaster if it ever happens again.</description>
