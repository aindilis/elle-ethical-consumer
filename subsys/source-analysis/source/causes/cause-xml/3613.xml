  <description>Bulembu, a town in Swaziland with heart and vision, is redefining and rebuilding itself. Abandoned by the mining industry, the future looked bleak. The inhabitants deserted the town and left with nothing. In a country further ravaged by AIDS - orphans and babies were impacted daily. But a team of entrepreneurs and social developers see potential in Bulembu and the spirit of the Swazi people. 

Today Bulembu has a vision  to create a totally self-sustaining community by 2020, restoring health, education, commerce and providing care for the children. Join our journey and breathe life back into the community in Bulembu.
