  <description>Throughout time Christians have shown many faces to the world.  This cause is about what I think is the next face of what the world should see Christianity as being.    The next face i believe is to Love God, Love People, and Love Life (yeah i stole it).  What this means is that the world will see that we love Jesus Christ above everything else and are completely committed to him.  The second is to love people, when Jesus was on the earth he cared deeply for people and helped and met their needs,  we need to do the same.  And finally love life, God has given us an amazing gift in life that we need to cherish and use fully for his glory and worship, while loving every minute of it.

1. Love Jesus Christ with all our hearts, soul and minds.

2. Love people and treat all people with the same love, respect and help that Jesus did

3. Love the life that God has given us on this earth.</description>
