  <description>The novel (especially the literary novel), is an endangered species.  Readership is shrinking while the number of creative writers is growing.  What are some grassroots ways we can address this issue?

1. We need to read.  We need to write.

2. Individual readers must do more to promote the books they think are important.

3. We must think of ways to engender and support alternatives to big New York publishing houses who (for the sake of survival), are entirely commercialized.</description>
