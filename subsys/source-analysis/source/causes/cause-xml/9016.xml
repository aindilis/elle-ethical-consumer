  <description>Although almost two years have past since this horrible disaster and the city is slowly being rebuilt, various animal shelters and organizations are still working hard to care for and find homes for all the pets that were left behind.
When Hurricane Katrina destroyed the city of New Orleans, people were forced to leave their pets behind because the city would not allow them to be evacuated with their owners. An estimated 600,000 pets were killed or left without shelter as a result of Hurricane Katrina.
With the help of volunteers and donations from all over the country, there has been much progress with the animal rescue efforts.
It made me think, "How many animals are still out there?".
There are still many homeless feral animals roaming the streets who are feed and watered by volunteers. New Orleans animal shelters are full, and there are dozens of posts on craigslists of forgotten pets looking for homes.
