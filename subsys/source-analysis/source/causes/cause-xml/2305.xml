And if I go, 
while you&#8217;re still here&#8230;
Know that I live on,
Vibrating to a different measure
Behind a thin veil you cannot see through&#9829;

You will not see me,
So you must have faith.
I wait for the time when
We can soar together again, 
both aware of each other.
Until then, live your life to its fullest
And when you need me,
Just whisper my name in your heart,
&#8230;I will be there&#9829;

There are some scars that can&#8217;t be seen by the eye...
Some wounds that will never heal...
Some hurts that time will never mend...
And broken with pieces missing that will... never be whole again&#9829;

When links of life are broken
And a child has to part
There is nothing that will ever heal
A parents broken heart&#9829;

**PLEASE NOTE** This is a cause that deals with the loss of precious lives &amp; I sadly welcome you all. However, any posts made on the wall that are insensitive or use any foul language WILL BE DELETED!!!
