  <description>The Zing Foundation aims to spark heart-felt, strategic, and substantial giving and to encourage the arts for social change: the use of arts and culture to address society-wide ills. Programs of the Zing Foundation include Bolder Giving, an initiative encouraging philanthropists to realize their full giving potential and the 50% League, a network of people giving more than half of their income, inheritance, or business profits.
