  <description>Many of the problems faced by today's children stem from the capability of educators and parents to properly raise and diagnose their children.

A perfect example of this is found in the case of ADD and ADHD.  The number one reason for the diagnosis of this disease is the fact that male students learn differently than female.  Because the male learns more through activity and hands-on experience than visually through books and lecture, many young boys are diagnosed with these disorders while their female counterparts (who learn by visual means) remain unharmed.  Because of the inability of teachers to adapt to their students' varying learning styles, many children are being misdiagnosed with these disorders, which is further hampering their learning capabilities, leading to a more severly-crippled education system and an inherently stupider society.

Rather than medicating children, educators and parents should better learn to fit the needs of the adolescents they are in authority over.

1. Stop diagnoses of ADD and ADHD.

2. Adapt to different learning styles.</description>
