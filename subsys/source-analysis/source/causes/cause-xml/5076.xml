  <description>Are you a baseball fanatic? Whether you enjoy playing it or just watch it, just join this group!  It doesn't matter what your favorite team is.  I just want all baseball fans to unite and come together and be the overall most popular, best sport.  So lets raise some money and get this done.

1. Baseball is BY FAR the best sport.

2. Football and basketball are way overrated.

3. Baseball should be the most popular sport on Earth.</description>
