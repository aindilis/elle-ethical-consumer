  <description>200 million Christians are persecuted for their faith. 

Open Doors exists to strengthen the church to be the church in the most hostile places on the planet. 

Open Doors provides spiritual, emotional and practical support (Bibles, training of pastors and youth workers, youth Bibles; trauma support for widows and orphans; safe houses for 'secret' believers, literacy classes...)


1. Every Christian who is persecuted should be remembered and helped by other Christians.

2. Every Christian is part of the Body of Christ - the family of God.</description>
