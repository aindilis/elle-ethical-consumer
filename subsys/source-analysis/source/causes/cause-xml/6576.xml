  <description>A cause for the people who want to fight it but don't know how.

Do you even know what it is?

Ovarian Cancer doesn't have nearly as much publicity as Breast Cancer or Lung Cancer but its just as deadly.

And I'm going to change that one day. Somehow.

But what about you? You might think you have to donate money, or time, or cut your hair, or run a race, or any of the other things people do to fight for a cure.

But you can spread the word, join this cause.

So if you know someone with cancer, make sure they know you love them. Tell them all the time, because you just never know.

And most of all, live your life to the fullest. Live (and love) every moment of it. Because their are so many people out their who seem to die before their lives seem fullfilled. So Live. Live for yourself. 

I'm sure that'll make your loved one proud.

Definition of ovarian cancer: Cancer that forms in tissues of the ovary (one of a pair of female reproductive glands in which the ova, or eggs, are formed). Most ovarian cancers are either ovarian epithelial carcinomas (cancer that begins in the cells on the surface of the ovary) or malignant germ cell tumors (cancer that begins in egg cells). 

I chose the American Cancer Society because that is what my Mother, who died of Ovarian Cancer, would want.



 

1. Ovarian Cancer is deadly but not well enough known.

2. We may not be able to cure it, but we can do something.

3. Spread the love and compassion for cancer victims.</description>
