  <description>Simple idea - fix the date of birth, not the age, for smoking. Would phase it out in australia completely, but allow all stakeholders a smooth exit from the industry.

Numerous health, social and economic benifits. read on:

Every year smoking kills, not only the people who choose to smoke but those who inhale it 2nd hand.

Smokers Birthday is about lifting the minimum age to legally smoke by one year, every year until no one is old enough to smoke any more.

Its simple if we fix the date of birth, not the age, for which you allowed to smoke this is in effect what will happen.

Further if the law introduced allows existing smokers (those born before the date) to continue smoking as they are legally addicts it would add a further stigma to this disease.

This is an achievable, long term goal that acknowledges existing smokers right to continue on, whilst preventing this problem from continuing.

This is a simple law to introduce, the government need only ban the sale of cigarettes, but include a "grandfather clause" allowing existing smokers (e.g. all people born before say 1990) to continue the wretched habit.

This provides a gradual and controlled approach to eliminating a problem, providing ample time for all stakeholders to embrace the change.
