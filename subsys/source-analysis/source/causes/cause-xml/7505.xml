  <description>In this day an age there is entirely to much instability in the world caused by greed. The United Nations security council has the top 5 arm dealing countries in the world. I think that is entirely too hipocritical. It is time that the business of war ends for there to be any hope of world peace. 

1. Profiting from war is inhumane.

2. The United States military spending is destabilizing the world.

3. Ending the occupation of Iraq is the first step.</description>
