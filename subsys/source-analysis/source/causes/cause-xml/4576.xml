  <description>The Rostro de Cristo program invites participants to: 1) lead a simple lifestyle; 2) build an intentional Christian community; 3) be in relationship with the people of Ecuador and reflect on the face of Christ in their joys and struggles; 4) Work with the Ecuadorian people to find long term solutions to the problems of poverty and together seek opportunities to improve the life of the people. Rostro de Cristo participants are thus witnesses to the Gospel and a source of hope and light in the community. These experiences will inspire life-long commitments to service, social justice and solidarity with the people of Ecuador and the world.

Programs: 	Rostro de Cristo offers a formal intensive program for volunteers to live and serve in Ecuador for one year. There are currently 8 volunteers living in two locations in Duran and serving Rostro de Cristo's various activities. Rostro de Cristo also offers short term retreat - immersion experiences for high school, university, parish or other groups. Over 2,000 retreatants have visited Duran since the program began in 1989.
