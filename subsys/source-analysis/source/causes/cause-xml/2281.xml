  <description>It's hard to believe, but there are still people in the US living in poverty without access to running water, quality healthcare, or a lot of the services you and I take for granted.  

Running Strong works to solve problems of poverty, economic and social discrimination, inadequate health care, and disappearing cultural resources in Indian Country.

We support organic gardens, drill water wells, language classes, housing initiatives, and youth centers in over 15 states.  

COME JOIN OUR CAUSE AND RUN STRONG WITH US
