  <description>Puerto Rico was conquered in 1898 by the USA from Spain, and has kept it as a colony, only allowing it to have a Constitution only giving domestic powers to the Puerto Rican elected government. Help Puerto Ricans to be able to choose by themselves what future they want through a Constitutional Assembly by supporting the House of Representatives Project 1230. 

The bill offers a fair, democratic and inclusive means for the people of Puerto Rico to express their voice and exercise their right of self-determination through a Constitutional Convention on status. 

The people of Puerto Rico would vote on the status option proposed by the Constitutional Convention and, if supported by the people, the preferred status option would then be submitted for Congressional consideration.

1. Puerto Rico must chose by itself what to do with its status.

2. Any status option must be selected by the Puerto Ricans, not by anyone else.

3. A Constitutional Convention of Status would guarantee Puerto Ricans to chose their own future.</description>
