  <description>The College Democrats of America Women's Caucus is one of the official vote based caucus of College Democrats of America. 

Since its 2006-2007 leadership, the caucus has taken an active role in social advocacy. Particularly, the CDA Women's Caucus launched the "ABCs of HPV" initiative, which created a national infrastructure of caucus representatives working with college based chapters to educate and advocate on behalf of young women and the impact of the HPV vaccine. See "whatisHPV.net" for more information.
