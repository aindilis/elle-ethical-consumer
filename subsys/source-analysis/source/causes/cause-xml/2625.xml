  <description>Animal Planet is partnering with leading animal organizations to inspire people like you to make the world a better place for animals. Together, we have the power to improve the lives of animals in our communities and in the wild. Simple things like volunteering at a local shelter, spreading the word about conservation, supporting a favorite animal cause or walking an elderly person's dog can make a difference. Even the smallest act has an impact. Join us in our passion to help animals.

1. Cruelty towards domestic and wild animals must end.

2. Hundreds of animal species need protection from extinction.

3. People need to be aware.</description>
