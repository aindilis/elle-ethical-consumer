  <description>The Lawrence Civic Choir, organized in 1975, welcomes singers from the area who love to perform serious, four-part choral music under a professional director. New members are welcome during the first couple of rehearsals each semester. We rehearse on Monday evenings from 7:30 to 9:30 at First Baptist Church, 1330 Kasold Drive, Lawrence, KS. Formal auditions are not required, but singers should be able to read music and sing tunefully.
