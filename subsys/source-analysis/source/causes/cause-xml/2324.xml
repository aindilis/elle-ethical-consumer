  <description>For those of us who have discerned that the Protestant Mainline Denominations have become wayward and are in great need of reform and renewal. These include the UMC, PCUSA, ELCA, UCC, ECUSA, ABC, CCDC, and UCCan. We recognize that aportionments have been misused to promote ungodly causes and organizations. We also realize our seminaries and educational institutions have been plagued with unsound biblical scholarship and worldviews. We believe that leaving is not an option and that fighting for renewal is the Godly thing to do. We believe that God can transform and renew the church even as lost as it may seem. We promise to work towards renewal by prayers, study, witness, and sound biblical teaching. 

1. Biblical Inerrancy/Infallibility

2. Creationism

3. Christ is the only way to heaven</description>
