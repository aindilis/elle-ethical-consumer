  <description>The members of the Westboro Baptist Church have been protesting outside of dead soldiers funerals to tell they're families God hates them. Fred Phelps, the leader of this organization, claims that America and Americans are doomed because of our tolerance of homosexuality. Find this hard to believe, then check out they're website at godhatesfags.com or @ godhatesamerica.com

If you're like me, these people disturb you and, you want nothing more than for them to be stopped!
