  <description>Gawad Kalinga (GK) translated in English means to &#8220;to give care&#8221;, and it is an alternative solution to the blatant problem of poverty not just in the Philippines but in the world. GK&#8217;s vision for the Philippines is a slum-free, squatter-free nation through a simple strategy of providing land for the landless, homes for the homeless, food for the hungry and as a result providing dignity and peace for every Filipino.  

What started in 1995 as a daring initiative by Couples for Christ to rehabilitate juvenile gang members and help out-of-school youth in Bagong Silang, Caloocan City, then the biggest squatters&#8217; relocation area in the Philippines, has now evolved into a movement for nation-building.  Together with its partners, Gawad Kalinga is now in the process of transforming poverty stricken areas with the goal of ending poverty for 5 million families by 2024.  To date Gawad Kalinga is in over 2000 communities all over the Philippines and in other developing countries.

Gawad Kalinga is more than about building houses for the poorest of the poor.  Providing a decent home is just the beginning of the transformation of the people and the community.
