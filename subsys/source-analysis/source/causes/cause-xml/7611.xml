  <description> 	 Addison's Disease is a rare hormonal disorder which affects approximately 1 to 2 per 100,000 people. It affects men and women alike and occurs in all age groups, including children.


Addison's disease occurs when there is chronic primary adrenal insufficiency or when the adrenal glands, the small glands that are located above each kidney, cease to function properly, this is also referred to as hypoadrenalism.
