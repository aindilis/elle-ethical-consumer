  <description>Kyle Hale is fighting "the man" by quiting his job and saying no to big business for their lackluster compenstation and benefits. Unfortunatly the mortgage company doesnt see the big picture and is still demanding montly payments. Obviously Kyle's stand has hit his income stream pretty hard. that is where YOU come in.  With these donations we can make Kyle' s monthly payments as he stands up for justice!

1. Fighting big business is quite the goal, lets stop the foreclosure!</description>
