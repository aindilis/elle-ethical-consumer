  <description>GW Dance Marathon, or as we call it Hippothon, is truly "The GW Miracle" - raising money for kids all year long at the Children's National Medical Center with the help of the Children's Miracle Network, which culminates with an all-out blowout each year. Don't worry, Hippothon NOT about dancing... it's about the kids!

Dance Marathon is a nationally recognized program at college campuses across the country with help from the Children's Miracle Network to benefit local children's hospitals affiliated with Children's Miracle Network.

GW Dance Marathon was renamed in 2007 to "Hippothon" in honor of our unofficial mascot: the hippo. The exact date of Hippothon 2008 has not been decided yet, but expect tons of fun, past years have included: tons of free food and prizes, various GW student group performances (a capella, dance, etc.) and live bands, contests, a wizard castle moonbounce, a poker tournament, a Dance Dance Revolution machine, a high energy "morale" dance taught ever hour, and visits by Children's Miracle Network families. Be sure to sign up now!

GW DANCE MARATHON... "Miracles are our business." Help us... and do it for the kids!
