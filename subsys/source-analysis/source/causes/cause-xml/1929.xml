My mother tells me prayer will help. 
I think it won't, but try again: 
"Look hard; their wings are white as milk, 
and if you smile, they'll sometimes grin." 

I looked so hard it hurt my eyes. 
But she was right. I saw blue lips 
and baby teeth, heard milky cries 
floating toward me like small ships. 

You're healed. Go unknown boy; go home. 
Your herd awaits the winter hay. 
But I was being nibbled down 
and soon would be as real as they.
