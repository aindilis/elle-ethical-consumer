  <description>With all the shootings at schools, malls, restaurants and just about anywhere else, law-makers need to get the guns out of the hands of ANYONE who's not a cop!!!!!
Screw "The right to bear arms".........times have changed too much since that was writen.
Plain and simple........if you're not a cop, you CAN'T own a hand gun.....
We wouldn't have to arm ourselves against the crackpots of this world if they didn't have thier guns.
NO MORE "accidental" shootings or messed up kids taking thier problems out on thier innocent schoolmates!!!

1. Only cops should carry hand guns.....

2. Mass government buy backs are needed

3. Stop selling hand guns to non-cops forever</description>
  <mission>abolish all hand guns except in the hands of law enforcment officials</mission>
