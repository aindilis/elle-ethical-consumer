  <description>Every 30 seconds a child dies from malaria.  Each year there is an estimated 300 to 500 million reported cases resulting in an average of 1 to 3 million deaths.  Malaria is currently an endemic in 105 countries. Around 90% of the cases that take place each year occur in Africa.  Currently malaria is the number one killer of children in Africa. Approximately 80-90% of the deaths in Africa are children under the age of five and pregnant mothers.
 
Despite the devasting effect Malaria has had in Africa and around the world, there is hope.  The number one preventative measure used to stop the spread of Malaria is insecticide-treated mesquitoe nets.  One net can protect a family of four and typically lasts up to four years.  Any donation, no matter how small, can make the differnce in the lives of African families and villages.  Even joining the group and shedding light on the issue will make a tremendous difference.
