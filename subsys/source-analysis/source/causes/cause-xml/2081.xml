  <description>"For all we need is Faith working through love." Galatians 5:6 is the verse this ministry revolves around. Founded in 1994 in McAllen, Texas, our vision is to complete five centers (church, clinic, dorm) along the border in Mexico, where people continue to struggle in third world conditions. Two centers are complete, with a third now underway.
