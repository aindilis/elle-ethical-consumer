  <description>We are a group of citizens representing sick/unemployed steel workers in South Africa. We believe 100's even 1000's have died to toxic exposure to manganese metal dust, however this occupational illness is undiagnosed, unrecognised, unacknowledged  and uncared for. Our families bear the burden of illness, care giving, stigma and death.

Can you help us in any way?

1. Report the death of the foreman instead of trying to cover up his death!!!

2. Compensate fairly 

3. Ensure medical assistance for the affected workers</description>
