  <description>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the muscle of the heart is abnormal in the absence of an apparent cause.  Surprisingly, 1 in 500 people have HCM, but unfortunately most of them are currently undiagnosed.  HCM is a primary and usually familial cardiac disorder with varied expression, unique pathophysiology, and a diverse clinical course.  While HCM has typically been recognized by its structure, i.e. hypertrophy, the electrical function of the heart is often also adversely affected.

With proper management and treatment patients can achieve a normal life span, however, without proper management HCM can cause significant disability and early death.  

HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac arrest among the young (under age 40).  Nearly 40% of the deaths of young athletes are attributed to HCM.  HCM remains cardiology's "great masquerader."
