  <description>Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited disease of the mucus &amp; sweat glands. It affects mostly your lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses &amp; sex organs.
CF causes your mucus to be thick &amp; sticky. The mucus clogs the lungs, causing breathing problems &amp; making it easy for bacteria to grow. This can lead to problems such as repeated lung infections &amp; lung damage.

Although there is no cure for CF, treatments have improved greatly in recent years. Until the 1980's, most deaths from CF occurred in children &amp; teenagers. Today, with improved treatments, people with CF live, on average, to be more then 35 years old.
