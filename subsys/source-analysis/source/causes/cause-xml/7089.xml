  <description>As Ghandi said " be there change you want to see in the world". It all starts with the individual. If you are aware of criminal activity, do something about it. 
How many times don't we hear about smash and grabds where vehicles behind the victim did nothing. Why not sound your hooter, call the police, or take a photo with your snazzy camera phone. 
The point is "Do Something".

1. Do something

2. Refuse to be a bystander

3. Get involved in your community watch - look and listen</description>
