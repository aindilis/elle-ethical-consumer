  <description>Seven year old Shreya, the oldest of three children, is suffering with luekemia for the past few years and each day is a new fight for her life. Her parents, who have to support their two young kids, are in tough financial situations. She is unable to attend school on a regular basis and is keeping her faith in the Lord to be able to see a new year. 

To Help:

Jesudoss is participating in an annual run for the Leukemia and would like your help to donate some money! This non-profit organization is dedicated to funding for education, blood cancer research, and patient services. 
Along with many associations, the goal is to cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, and to improve the quality of the many patients and family members suffering. 

Each year, the society holds marathons to help raise money for the research and for patient services.
We would like as many people to join this cause and more importantly help raise as much money as possible!
