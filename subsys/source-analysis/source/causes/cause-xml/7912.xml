  <description>Many people out in the world such as Africa, have many infants, children, teens, and adults that are sleeping outside on the ground with no clothes, blankets, nor food to eat and having one minor meal a day. Many kids die a day from living in a poor area where no one cares about them, starving day after day and becoming more and more sick. We need to give people a heads up on how selfish we seem when we want something we just have to get or we just have to eat 3 meals a day, and we should realize how many people in the world don't have nearly as much as we have so you should just respect everything that you have. So let people know how much those people need your help and how lucky you are to have what you have.

1. We must do something to stop the death of so many children

2. The poor must get help daily 

3. People should realize how lucky they really are to have what they have</description>
