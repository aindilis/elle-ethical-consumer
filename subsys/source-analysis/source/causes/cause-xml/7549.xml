  <description>Most of you people when you see a spider have the instinct to squash it and destroy it! You could just cup it with a piece of paper and a glass and put it outside, don't kill it!


1. Spiders kill off the truly annoying insects that have no value to the eco-system (e.g. Mosquitos, Flys)

2. Most of the are harmless, so why kill them?

3. They help us and the enviroment out a lot by trapping parasites and other things messing up the environment!</description>
