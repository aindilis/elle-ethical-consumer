  <description>This cause is Inspired by the "Great Divide" project in collaboration with the perinatal HIV research unit in Soweto, South Africa. Unfortuantely we cannot raise money directly for this cause however we can help by raising money for the Art AIDS Africa project which supports African charity projects through the selling of African art and crafts in the US.

Hanson recently created and moved to their own own indie label, 3CG Records and recorded the song &#8220;The Great Divide&#8221; with a African childrens choir, which has been released on iTunes. The song raises awareness of the AIDS epidemic in Africa and each download raises money for the research unit in Soweto! It reminds onlookers of the hope still seen in the eyes of the young children and generations living in a time of uncertainty.
