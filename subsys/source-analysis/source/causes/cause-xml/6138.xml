  <description>The &lt;a href='http://www.disclosureproject.org/'&gt;Disclosure Project&lt;/a&gt; is a nonprofit research project working to fully disclose the facts about UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence, and classified advanced energy and propulsion systems. It has over 400 government, military, and intelligence community witnesses testifying to their direct, personal, first hand experience with UFOs, ETs, ET technology, and the cover-up that keeps this information secret.

For those who might be wondering what the &lt;a href='http://www.cseti.org/'&gt;Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI)&lt;/a&gt; might be or why you should donate to it, it is the parent association for the Disclosure Project. A donation to CSETI is thus a donation to the Disclosure Project itself.

1. The U.S. Congress should hold open, secrecy-free hearings on the UFO/Extraterrestrial presence on and around Earth.

2. The U.S. Congress should hold open hearings on advanced energy and propulsion systems that, when publicly released, will provide solutions to global environmental challenges.

3. The U.S. Congress should enact legislation which will ban all space-based weapons.

4. The U.S. Congress should enact comprehensive legislation to research, develop and explore space peacefully and cooperatively with all cultures on Earth and in space.</description>
