  <description>On September 8th, Cosmetic and Sedation Dentistry will be hosting "Dentistry With a Heart".  It's simple. . . for one day only, we will be offering extractions, fillings, and cleanings for FREE to people that simply cannot afford dental care.  Our services will be limited to one procedure per person, so that we may help as many people in our community as possible!!!  It will be held from 7AM - 4PM  at the following location:

2100 Riverside Prkwy
Suite 130
Lawrenceville, GA  30043

If you are interested in volunteering, or need more information, please visit us at   dentalheart.com .
