  <description>Help those who served us.
The National Military Family Association (NMFA) was organized in 1969 as the National Military Wives Association by a group of wives and widows seeking financial security for survivors of uniformed service personnel and retirees. From their efforts, the Survivor Benefit Plan came into being. In the ensuing years, NMFA has been in the vanguard of advocacy for improvements in the quality of military family life. The name of the organization was changed in 1984 to reflect the broad scope of its involvement. NMFA is a non-profit 501(c)(3) association.

NMFA, "The Voice for Military Families," is dedicated to providing information to and representing the interests of family members of the uniformed services on which our national security depends. Its website, www.nmfa.org, provides extensive information for military families and those who service them. It publishes a monthly newsletter as well as a weekly legislative e-mail newsletter, the Government and You E-News. For more information about NMFA, to schedule an NMFA presentation, or request NMFA promotional materials, please contact NMFA at 703-931-6632 or at families@nmfa.org.
