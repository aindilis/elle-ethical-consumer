  <description>It's been proven in a wide range of medicinal aspects. It's used to help cancer patients gain an appetite during harsh chemo treatments, and for minor pain relief. Doctors prescribe all kinds of dangerous prescriptions daily. Including pain killers, anti-depressants and steroids. ALL of which come with warning labels and long lists of side effects. Yet "Marijuana" is labeled as an Ellegal narcotic.Why? All these other drugs have side effects and warnings. The doctors tell the patient straight out that these drugs can have long/short terms negative effects. Why deny people the right to smoke a joint once in awhile? Personally I've NEVER heard of anybody dying as a result of smoking weed, directly, or indirectly.

2. We'll smoke it anyway.

3. Illegal? Why?</description>
