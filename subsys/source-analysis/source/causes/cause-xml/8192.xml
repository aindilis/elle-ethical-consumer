  <description>Cheetahs are constantly under threat from hunters and farmers who shoot them. They also struggle with ever decreasing land areas to exist on, as they need space on savannahs.  They run so fast (approx110kms p/h) during a hunt, that often they cannot see the unexpected farm fences that they then hit at that speed, which usually kills them instantly.

1. Cheetah conservation awareness must grow

2. Irreplaceable, unique animals.

3. Support organisations such as De Wildt and Spier cheetah breeding programmes.</description>
