  <description>Greyhounds Unlimited was founded in 1991 in Fort Worth, Texas by Hope Combest and several dedicated volunteers. As with most fledgling non-profits, we started small. However, it quickly became clear that we could acquire and adopt many more greyhounds than our small foster kennel could house.

Over the years, Greyhounds Unlimited has become more of a residential foster home-based organization. This means our volunteers foster any number of rescued greyhounds in their private homes until the dogs are placed in permanent homes. We have found using a residential foster home is the most effective means of ensuring that retired racing greyhounds become acclimated to a home environment prior to their adoption.

Greyhounds Unlimited has no paid staff. We are strictly a volunteer-run organization. All volunteers donate their time and energy at no cost.
