  <description>The Shepherd's Homes in Kenya provide hope and love for children orphaned by AIDS in Africa. Our name comes from Psalms 23:1, "Because the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want."

Although these children are HIV-negative, their families have been devastated by AIDS. Their family members have either died or are no longer able to care for them. The Shepherd's Home is truly a sanctuary, not only providing food and housing, but a safe-haven for the children of the African AIDS crisis to feel love, support, and to better understand what is happening in their world.

Working together with the support of Discover The World, Inc., a religious non-profit corporation founded in 1989 by Doug and Jackie Millham, The Shepherd's Home offers the best chance for these children to end the deadly cycle of AIDS and to help build the "new" Kenya.
