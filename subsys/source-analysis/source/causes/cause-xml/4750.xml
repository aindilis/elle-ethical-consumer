  <description>How many years does it take to ban an energy wasting lightbulb?

Greenpeace is asking you to take part in an 
energy revolution. 
To go from a world powered by nuclear and fossil
fuels to one running on renewable 
energy. 
Human caused climate change is a 
reality. 
Fortunately, there are proven energy 
solutions we can put to use today to provide sustainable 
development 
and energy for all. 
Will this energy transformation 
occur rapidly 
enough to avert the worst effects 
of a warming world? 
You will help decide the answer to that question.

July 7, 2007 (7.7.07) will see millions of people 
gather for Al Gore's Live Earth climate change 
concerts all over the world. 
It could be the biggest 
international awareness-raising event ever.

We're starting with the most outrageously wasteful
of electrical household items: the incandescent 
light bulb. 
Consider this: A simple switch to energy
saving bulbs in the European Union 
alone would save 20 million 
tonnes of CO2, equal to shutting 
down 25 medium-size dirty 
power plants;and this 
is before we consider the efficiency of other household products, or even cars!

If you still need convincing to join the energy revolution, check out what climate change 
will mean for you:
