  <description>The FEAR Festival in New Orleans is created to bring attention to Louisiana Effects Artists. There are many effects artists from all media backgrounds that work and reside in the state of Louisiana, although most of the artists are looked over when it comes to film work. My company, Lucid SFX Development (LSD), is looking to push the effects and animation artists further into the film industry!

This kind of promotional event of course costs money so my cause is to get more funding for my Film Effects and Animation Revival In New Orleans Festival put together by the Effects team at Lucid SFX Development. 

1. Put Great Artists in contact with Great Filmakers.

2. Put Lucid SFX Development inot more feature films

3. Give Louisiana Artists a true chance in the major film industry!</description>
