  <description>We need everyone to understand that the quality of movies coming out of South Africa is amazing and that there are plenty of brilliant stories to tell. 
For that to realise we need people to tell their friends and their friends and their friend;s friends to support our movies. 
Otherwise it will be the end of our industry soon....

1. South Africans need to support South African films.

2. SA films need to be good enough to be shown worldwide.

3. SA talent and crew must ALL strive for creative excelence and not be happy with anything less.</description>
