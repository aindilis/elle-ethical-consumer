  <description>     Kids today are getting too caught up in artificial amusements, theres nothing wrong with video games, cable TV, etc. but too much of these things can be bad.. and it can have serious consequences on their health.

    I've witnessed to many youth that would rather sit inside and play video games/watch TV/movies all day than go outside, too many that instead of walking to the store would whine for a ride.

    I've also seen many couples that their "thing to do together" is play video games all the time, I agree it is fun to compete with the one you love but video games should not be the main activity you do together.

    I encourage everyone to get their friends/relatives and go out for a walk once in a while. Go for a bike ride or rollerblading. Just plain get outside for some physical activity. Get all your friends together for a game of baseball or soccer etc. there are many MANY things that you can come up with and there are many benefits to physical activity.

     We're not here to ban video games or shut down TV's, just to get youth more involved with physical activities so we can battle the rising population of overweight individuals.




1. Get Youth More Involved in Physical Activites
