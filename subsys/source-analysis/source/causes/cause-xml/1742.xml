  <description>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) is committed to exceptional patient care and leading-edge research. The close collaboration between physicians and scientists is one of Sloan-Kettering's unique strengths, enabling them to provide patients with the best care available today as research continues to uncover more effective strategies to prevent, control, and ultimately cure cancer in the future. (Excerpt from mskcc.org)

MSKCC is more than just a research institute. The doctors at MSKCC are caring, supportive individuals. They make every patient feel like a real person, not just a diagnosis.This kind of care and expertise should be available to any and everyone in need.

Donating directly to Sloan-Kettering is one way in which you can help improve the current situation in cancer treatment, but there are many more options. Join MSKCC's marathon charity team, Fred's Team or pledge to sponsor a team member from the comfort of your own room. Volunteer to visit patients at MSKCC's clinic (I recommend the pediatric clinic). Donate blood and platelets at a MSKCC blood drive. Even simpler, buy something from the MSKCC thrift shop. 

1. Research is necessary in order to ultimately cure cancer.
