  <description>Michael Cuccione was diagnosed with a type of cancer called Hodgkin's Disease in July of 1994 when he was only nine years old. He went through six months of chemotherapy treatments and was thought to have been cured, but the cancer returned. This time, it really damaged his lungs. Again, Michael went through major chemo sessions around his heart and lungs and a bone marrow transplant. Luckily, the treatments were a success and by '96 Michael had been cancer-free for a year. But just because Michael Cuccione seemed to be done battling cancer inside his body, he wasn't done battling it outside. 
On March 12, 1997 he formed The Michael Cuccione Foundation. The Foundation tries to make people realize the ongoing need to fund cancer research. The money raised provides emotional support for cancer patients and their families and helps fund cancer research, among other things. 
After all this hard work, by the end of 1997, 12 year-old Michael Cuccione had raised over $175,000 for the Michael Cuccione Foundation. A year later, he went to Rome and was blessed by Pope John Paul II. 
Michael Cuccione passed away on January 13, 2001. His passing was due to respiratory failure. His lungs were weakened from previous chemotherapy treatments and he had been fighting respiratory problems for months. Though he was only 16 when he died Michael Cuccione had lived a full life. The world didn't just lose Q.T. they lost a true hero.
