  <description>In Africa half of the elephant population, about 600,000 elephants, have died not from natural causes, but from poachers.  Humans have been responsible for the decline of the elephants from 300,000 in the 1970s to about 10,000 today.  These animals do not die because the poacers are in need of their meat, they die for their ivory tusks.  Ivory has become illegal in many countries such as the United States, but it is imposible to tell how old the ivory is without proper documentation. 

Poachers hunt down the 3,500 elephants when they leave Zakouma National Park in Chad during the dry season. However, the elephants aren't the ones being killed.  The guards who volunteer to protect the elephants are also being hunted down. Unofficially, it's shoot to kill on both sides.  The "Ivory Wars," as it has become known as, need to come to an end before we, humans, cause the etinction of another animal on this earth.
