  <description>The Lower Eastside Girls Club is dedicated to providing a place where girls and young women 8-23 can grow, learn, have fun, and develop confidence in themselves and their ability to make a difference in the world. By delivering strong and innovative arts, athletic, cultural, life-skills and career oriented programming, we provide girls with the vision to plan - and the tools to build - their future. 

 Our current mission is two-fold: first, to deliver high-quality services that meet the needs of the girls we currently serve, and secondly, to create a lasting facility-based institution dedicated to providing services to Lower Eastside girls and their families long into the future. 

The new Lower Eastside Girls Club Center for Community opens in 2012.
