  <description>Kibera, East Africa's largest slum, has a violent history of ethnic and religious tension. More than 700,000 Kibera residents -- half of whom are under the age of 15 -- live in an area of Nairobi, Kenya that is the size of Manhattan's Central Park. There is a dearth of basic government services, including provision of clean water and trash removal.

Carolina for Kibera, Inc. (CFK) is a nonprofit charitable corporation and program of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) based at the Center for Global Initiatives. 

CFK, Inc. is the patron of four CFK-Kenya organizations in Kibera: the Youth Sports Program, Tabitha Medical Clinic, the Binti Pamoja (Daughters United) Center, and Taka ni Pato (Trash is Cash) program.  Each program is organized and driven by young leaders and residents of Kibera. Oversight and governing is provided by a Kenya-based Board of Trustees and a U.S.-based Board of Directors.
