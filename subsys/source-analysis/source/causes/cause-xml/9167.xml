  <description>I cannot understand how a grown man can penetrate a little baby, a toddler or a newborn infant without feeling any guilt when that child feels his huge manhood entering him or her.  The child obviously screams like man and cries from the bottom of his or her heart yet the man feels nothing and continues.  I have had a child and afterwards you cannot make love as it is too sore.....how does a little baby or child feel.  And when they rape little baby boys or toddler boys in the bum.......face the fact that these men must burn in hell for what they do.  Yet they sit in jail and eat food and use electricity from our tax money.  Burn in hell.....the Lord help them should they touch my children.
