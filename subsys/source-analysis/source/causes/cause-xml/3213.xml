  <description>Animals are being carelessly abused and over-used everyday, which includes being tested on. Did you know that in a society as advanced as ours, we still test out products on animals? Yes, it's very sad actually. Please join this cause so that we can unite as Animal Lovers to combat this sickening issue.

1. Animals shouldn't be tested on. 

2. Animals have the right to live as well. 

3. In our society, we should test on human cultures instead of animals. This will mean better accuracy and no pain whatsoever to any animal. 

4. The death of an animal due to testing and negligence is unjustifiable murder.</description>
