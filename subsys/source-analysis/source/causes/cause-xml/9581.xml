  <description>Greg Steir (creator of d2s ministry) inspired me to create this cause. It was opening night @ NYC '07 that I heard Greg speak. He is an amazing speaker. In his sermon, he mentioned how our generation shuns Jesus when we're around our friends. How instead of sharing Christ with the world, we make him our embarassing friend. He dared us to share Christ with others...SO, I dare you!
