  <description>Software updates come out daily and computers go out of date quickly. This should not be the case in schools, were everyone needs to be able to be compatible so they can complete basic schoolwork. Much money is wasted no buying software licenses so the computers can turn on. This shouldn't be the case. If we constrain ourselves to being exploited by the big companies, then we have a very grim future, as many people who were disadvantaged in their upbringing will not be able to succeed as well as people who could afford the latest and greatest software.

1. Money does not determine the how much of an education you can recieve.

2. Since the schools are a place of learning, no one shall be left in the dark when they need to complete schoolwork.

3. People should learn how to complete a task and not a learn how to use a specific program.</description>
