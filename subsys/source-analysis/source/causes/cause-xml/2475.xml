  <description>We are that band of merry men who seek to relocate the wealth of Babylon back into the hands of the those who are poorest.

Don't bury your coins.
Join this revolutionary cause. 
Tithe 10%.

1. Babylon's coffers are swelling.

2. We line our pockets with her spoils.

3. We lend to those outside her walls.

4. Poverty will soon be vanquished.</description>
