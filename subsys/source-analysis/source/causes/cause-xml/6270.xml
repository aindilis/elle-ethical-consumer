  <description>I believe that bullying is the main cause of teenage suicide and school shootings.
WHEN WILL SCHOOL AUTHORITIES AND PARENTS OPEN THEIR EYES TO THE PAIN THESE CHILDREN ARE FACING EVERYDAY???

1. I BELIEVE IF WE END BULLYING IN THE SCHOOLS WE WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

2. ZERO TOLERANCE DOESN'T MEAN TURN A BLIND EYE!!!

3. HEAR THE PAIN!</description>
