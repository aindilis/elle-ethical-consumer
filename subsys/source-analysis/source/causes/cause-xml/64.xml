  <description>The redistricting process has been abused by legislators all around the country.  Legislators have used this power to draw safe districts for themselves, their party members, and their cronies.  Ultimately, this has led to very uncompetitive elections, alarmingly high incumbency, and gridlock throughout our state and federal government.

It is time for us to stand up and say that we want to choose our elected officials - we do not want our officials to choose the people they want in their district.

Redistricting reform is supported by many good government organizations including Common Cause, the League of Women Voters, PIRGs, the Reform Institute, and Mobilize.org.

What Are Your Boundaries?  Draw the line and support redistricting reform throughout our nation (in red and blue states - this is a democracy issue not a partisan issue).

1. Legislators have abused the redistricting process to create safe elections for themselves

2. Leaving the power of redistricting in the hands of elected officials creates a clear conflict of interest

3. Creating independent redistricting commissions will allow these lines to be draw in an appropriate way that puts the voters interest ahead of the incumbants</description>
