  <description> In memory of my dear friend Andrea Pike(nee Pennefather) who was killed by a street racer on May 30, 2000. She was just 29 years old and left behind a 3 year old and a 5 year old. She was on her lunch break.

Racing is for the track...not for our streets. We have a right to be safe driving to work, driving to lunch...wherever...

Help spread the word...stop street racing.

See also..York Region Police Project Erase....which is also dedicated to Andrea's memory. 

We are trying to raise money to help start a program to help stop street racing.

1. Racing is for the track....not our streets

2. People of all ages should be aware of the dangers of Street Racing

3. Togeather we can put a Stop to it!!!!</description>
