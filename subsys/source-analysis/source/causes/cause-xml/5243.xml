  <description>Among many other services, USO general programs include celebrity entertainment tours, children's programs (especially around holidays), telephone, Internet and email capabilities for deployed soldiers, and USO Canteens and USO Centers which, on or off base, provide a relaxing, homey and wholesome alternative to daily stress.


You can also visit the USO care package website to sponsor a care package for a deployed soldier:
http://www.operationusocarepackage.org

Or, if you would rather make a more personalized donation, you can contact me for the address of a randomly selected soldier and send a care package or letter directly to them over seas.

1. It doesn't matter if you support the war, support the troops.

2. Boost morale by sending care packages or even just a letter.

3. Support the families of deployed soldiers during their time of need.</description>
