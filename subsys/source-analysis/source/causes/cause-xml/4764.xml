  <description>In a poor area of the north of Lima, the Center Pedro Jose Triest answers the need of educating children and adolescents with Down Syndrome, Autism, Cerebral Palsy, and severe Mental Retardation, without distinction of race, religion or sex. Priority is given to children most in need and often rejected by other school and society. 

The Brothers of Charity believe that they also deserve respect and they see to it that competent personnel give quality education in a caring environment.
