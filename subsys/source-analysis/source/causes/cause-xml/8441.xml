  <description>My Daughter as been abducted by her mother 2 years ago .. I haven't seen her in 2 years ,, It's driving me crazy .. I miss her so much , she's so lovely .. Unfortunately the laws in Quebec are so F. Dumb it's incredible .. 
Her mother is so selfish she doesn't even think about the child needs ,, she only thinks about what she wants ,, and vengeance ..!! 
I've called every where to get some help ,, Ministry for justice ,, The Canadian Human Right Commision and Youth rights ,, The Child and Family Benefits services ,, My local deputy ,, and i'M probably forgetting some .. :S 
NO one can help .. there's no laws to help me ,, All they want is money to go to court .. 6000$ just to start the case .. It's just incredible
I wanna see my daughter ,, i wanna see her grow up ,, i wanna give her love and everything she needs ..
It should be illegal to declare unknown father ,, when you know who it is .. ( it's so selfish ) ans ladies do that only to get more welfare ,, it's insane !! 
 Plz join the cause ,, the more we are ,, the more chance we get to get things changing 

p.s  i'm french so if someone can help me edit the text it would be nice cause i know it ain't perfect .. just msg me plz .. 

P.s Don't donate to this organism ( well donate if you wish ,, but i ain't supporting this orgasnism ,, i just had to chose one and since there isn't any in Quebec or Canada ,, i chose this one but i would have like to create my own ) 
P.s If anyone knows a lawyer who could help me in Quebec and who talks french ,, just let me know ...
