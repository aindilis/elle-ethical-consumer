  <description>Every day, kids around the world, kids just like you and me have to endure mind-numbingly, soul-crushingly dull and uninteristing lives bereft of awesome graphics and online play. Imagine going an entire day without feeling the cool plastic grip of the wireless controller and it's life affirming rumble of joy. This is a reality that tens, if not hundreds of kids around America are forced to indure every single day. 

But there is hope. With just a meager donation, a few pennies or dollars, you too can end the unspeakable suffering of these Halo 3 deprived American Youths. Every second you hesitate to act is another moment these poor children have to endure the reality of a universe that has left them behind in the journey towards World Fragging.

You do love children don't you? Please, think of the children. Please, donate today.
