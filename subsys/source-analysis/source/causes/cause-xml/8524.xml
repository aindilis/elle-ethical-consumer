  <description>"More than 50,000 people were killed, and about 5,000 children were kidnapped by rebel armies such as the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), to serve in the 10-year-civil war in Sierra Leone, Africa in 1991-2001" (Harman, D., 2002, p.1).  Sierra Leone, a former British colony, is a small country on the west coast of Africa with great diamond wealth.  With the rise in power by Siaka Steven, former prime minister of Sierra Leone in the 1970's, he had broke many promises and bonds with the civilians.  He was also poorly organized and often neglected their input.  He also criminalized the diamond industry, therefore triggered a civil war movement in 1991.  Rebel groups such as the Revolutionary United Front, led by Foday Sankoh, gathered an army consisting children, as young as 4 years old.  Steven's also gathered his army, known as the International Security Unit (ISU), fighting for the possessions of the diamonds that are scattered throughout Africa.  Liberia's leader, Charles Taylor and his National patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), joined and funded the RUF to gain an alliance.  Children were abducted from the streets or their homes, given drugs to essentially make them fearless in battle, and constantly abused them in order for them to be loyal to their army.

1. Child soldiering around the world must end.

2. Interim care centers and agencies need support.

3. Children's rights and obligations need to be re-evaluated in Sierra Leone.</description>
