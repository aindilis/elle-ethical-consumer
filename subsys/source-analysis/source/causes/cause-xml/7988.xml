  <description>Every cancer survivor deserves the chance to receive a college education.  Yet the burden of medical debt, side effects of treatment, and limited access to financial resources leaves many young adult cancer survivors with little hope of attending college.  Carolyn&#8217;s Compassionate Children (CCC), founded nine years ago by Carolyn Rubenstein, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for young adult cancer survivors through two initiatives: 
 
&#8226; An annual college scholarship program that recognizes survivors who demonstrate leadership, commitment to education, and betterment of their community.  
&#8226; An online support network that connects survivors and provides a comprehensive database of financial resources for higher education. 

Care. Commit. Change.
