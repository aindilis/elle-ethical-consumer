  <description>ME Research UK is a charity with the principal aim of commissioning and funding scientific (biomedical) investigation into the causes, consequences and treatment of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (also known as ME/CFS). This is a debilitating illness which affects between 120,000 and 240,000 people in the UK, but which is not well understood nor, in many cases, properly recognised.

1. It is a real, often relapsing, debilitating illness, affecting up to 150,000 people in the UK, with similar rates of incidence in Europe, USA, New Zealand and Australia.

2. ME/CFS has a huge impact on the lives of families and carers, but little, if any, support is available to them.

3. The cause is still unknown, and no cure or effective treatment has yet been found.</description>
