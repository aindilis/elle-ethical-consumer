  <description>I'm bustin him out.  Meet at Carn Brea Harbour where we will sail to Helston and head down the treacle mine. From there we tunnel up and rescue him. Doing it on Flora day to use the hullaballoo as cover.

Watch this clip. Its Bull. Gus is actually trapped in Flambards.  I read the following posts and i was shocked at the extent of his misery. 

"Gus honeybun lives on at flambards, not the same though, he lives in a plastic cage and one of his eyes has stopped working so it looks quite disturbing. I think he needs rescuing by RSPCA personally, it was quite upsetting. See what making him unemployed did!!"

 and then this ...


"Don't panic about his freaky eye, cos he actually has a spare head. I should know, he used to live with me in the school holidays. Mum had her hand up his arse on many occasions! A plastic cage is definitely a step up though - better than being stuffed into a picnic hamper... sorry to shatter any illusions! As for Judy Spiers, she has a lot to answer for!"

Lets rescue him.  Call your friends.  We cannot allow this to continue.

i love you all
