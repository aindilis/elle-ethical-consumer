For more than 80 years, our United Way has brought people together to care for one another. We raise funds, mobilize volunteers, help to strengthen agencies, identify critical and unmet needs in the community, and help to build collaborations with the public and private sector to meet those needs.

Through our annual campaign we raise funds to support a network of nearly 200 local health and human service organizations in our 16-county Missouri and Illinois region. 

More than 90 cents of every dollar your United Way receives helps people in our community. Rigorous examination of member agencies &#8211; from program results to governance to overall quality &#8211; not only helps determine funding, it also ensures that agencies are meeting the needs of your friends, neighbors, co-workers &#8211; perhaps even your family.
