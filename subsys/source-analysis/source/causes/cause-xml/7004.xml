  <description>Invisible Children is an organization based in San Diego, California. Named after the 2003 film with the same title, IC's goal is to end a 21 year war that has been raging in Northern Uganda. This war has forced families into displacement camps where many children are kidnapped and taken as child soldiers by the LRA(Lord's Resistance Army). The LRA is led by Joseph Kony and their main goal is to overthrow the government.
