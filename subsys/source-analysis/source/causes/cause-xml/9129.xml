  <description>Masturbation is activity as old as human kind. It relieves stress, it helps lower the percentage of premarital sex, and it just feels good. These are just a few of the advantages of masturbation. Of course, just like alcohol, it should be done in moderation. Unfortunatley some people in the world have negative feelings for masturbating. Some think it's unhealthy, some think it's uncool, and some think it's unholy. But, these are all untrue. We need to increace the population's awareness of the benefits of masturbating. 

Also, Pornography is an artform, it's all in the eye of the beholder. Some art is better than others, like porn; some art is distubing, like porn; and some art is beautifle, like porn. Why should it be made censored from the world? Why do we have to go to the murkiest depths of the internet to find it? We believe for the sake of masturbation it should be brought more mainstream. 

1. Every one should masturbate

2. Porn should readily available to anyone

3. It should be removed of its social stigma</description>
