  <description>Whirlow Hall Farm Trust is a charity based on a real working farm on the edge of Sheffield. Nearly 9,000 children a year have an experience they never forget by visiting Whirlow. Inner city children who have never even seen a cow or eaten homecooked food are given these and numerous other opportunites such as riding a pony, growing their own vegetables, exploring nature and gain respite by being allowed to simply 'be'.
