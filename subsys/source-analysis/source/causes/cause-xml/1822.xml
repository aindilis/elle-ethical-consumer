  <description>This cause is made to entertain all those of you that are interested in the dental field. It is a great way to bond and gain experience on how to get into dental school, and what classes are needed. We all have one thing in common, we seek dentistry as a career. So to those of you who are interested feel free to join this group and attend our weekly meetings.
Starting in Summer 07 we will do our best in helping you gain the confidence needed to become a dentist and face the highiest suicidal rate in this universe.

Also, we appreciate any donations that you are willing to give us in order to better our services at the university. Please feel free to donate what you want, in any form.

1. Education is highly recommended

2. Dentistry is a great career to seek

3. Happy, Nice Smiles</description>
