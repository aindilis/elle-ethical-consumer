  <description>Umbilical cord blood is human blood from the placenta and umbilical cord that is rich in hematopoietic stem cells. Cord blood is collected after the umbilical cord has been detached from the newborn, and utilized as a source of stem cells for transplantation.

Cord blood stem cells have been used to treat a number of blood and immune-system related genetic diseases, cancers, and disorders. Because of medical issues around using one's own cells, in nearly every instance the treatments are done using cells from another donor, with the vast majority being unrelated donors.

The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 is not only aimed at increasing the medical utilization rate for cord blood stem cells, but is also aimed at increasing cord blood stem cell research. All cord blood collected and deemed unsuitable for transplant is required to be donated for research.
