  <description>UII ("We") aims to first, raise awareness and understanding of invisible illnesses.  The general population does not even realize they exist, let alone comprehend the extent of the diagnoses or symptoms.  Second, provide support to sufferers, caregivers, friends, and families.  Third, to provide access to resources, sounding boards, and someday funds for sufferers.

We are currently focusing on goals one and two.  Please see the UII Facebook group and/or contact the creator for more details.

1. Invisible Illnesses are misunderstood.

2. Sufferers also face prejudice and need support.

3. Knowledge leads to understanding which leads to change and peace.</description>
