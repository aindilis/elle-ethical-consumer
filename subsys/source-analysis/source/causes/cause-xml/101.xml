  <description>80% of Worldwide Refugees are Women &amp; Children.

They've lost their families, their property, their health and their dignity &#8211; but these women survivors of war have not lost their hope. With your support, these women can gain the skills they need to rebuild their lives and their communities. 
 
Women for Women International helps women in war-torn regions by providing: 

&#8226; financial and emotional support
&#8226; job skills training
&#8226; rights awareness
&#8226; microcredit loans &amp; small business assistance

Women for Women International is currently working in:
-----------------------------------------------------------
&#8226;  Afghanistan  &#8226;  Iraq &#8226;  Bosnia and Herzegovina &#8226; 
Kosovo &#8226;  Nigeria &#8226;  Colombia &#8226;  Rwanda &#8226; Congo &#8226; Sudan 

Sponsor a woman and create a one-to-one connection with woman in one of these war-torn countries.  For $27 a month, you can literally change her life, the life of her children and have a direct impact upon her community and her nation.
