  <description>I don't know much about the subject at hand but i do know what is happening is an injustice. And every day that i look at my puppy it hurts me knowing that other dogs aren't being treated the way Elle, My Little Chihuahua/ Miniature Schnauzer is. So this is for every person who has a dog, a cat, any animal!! For anyone who believes animals have rights, and feelings and who feel it is important to make a change. I am not asking for money, just your support. 

Thank you.
