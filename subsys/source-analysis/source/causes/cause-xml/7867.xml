  <description>As free Americans, we deserve to keep our right to bear arms. If we ban citizen's from owning guns...what will they do if someone breaks into their homes and threatens their lives? We'd love to think America was a safe place that wasn't at risk for those things. We'd love to believe the famous "That would never happen to ME" phrase. But it DOES happen. There are causes for self defense against American lives every single day. WE WANT TO KEEP THIS RIGHT!!!

1. The Right to Bear Arms is a right that MUST stay in tact.</description>
