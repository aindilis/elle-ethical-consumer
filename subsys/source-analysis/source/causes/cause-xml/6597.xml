  <description>Smile at the person next in line... 
at the person you sit next to on the bus... 
at that lovely lady with her dog in the street... 
at that grumpy man in the cashier... 
at that mean busdriver... 

start a conversation with the lady in line... 
start a conversation with that boy on the train... 

just smile and be more positive! Just be more open to the world, and it will smile right back at you!
