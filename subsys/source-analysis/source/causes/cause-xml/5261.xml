  <description>Much of Darfur suffers from malnutrition due to inadequate food supply and nutritional content. As a result, expectant mothers experience serious problems. Youth mortality is also very high. 

Our health/nutrition program is working to eradicate problems among young children and mothers.Relief International supports the nutritional status of malnourished children (5-year-olds) as well as women who are pregnant or lactating. RI is also providing health services to nearly 100,000 women and children in IDP camps.

Through permanent clinics, regular medical treatment, reproductive health support, nutritional supplements and health training of community health workers and birth attendants, RI is improving the health condition of mothers and children in Darfur.

1. Through supplementary feedings, rehabitation of health facilities and the training of local health staff, thousands of lives can be saved. Darfurian women and children need your support</description>
