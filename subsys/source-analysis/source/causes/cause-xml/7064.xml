  <description>The PORR (Penang Outer Ring Road) is going to development within this year (2007) 
This development will change the surrounding  ecosystem within certain commercial areas within our beloved island (Penang). Do we really want and need it? 
Why not use the money to develop better transportation services and not destroy what is left of our beautiful island?

Your input and ideas of how we can work around this, or maybe your insight on if the PORR development is for the best interest to all of us, including our children.
