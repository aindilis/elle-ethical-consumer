  <description>Camp Koinonia is a week long residential outdoor education program for over 120 children who have a variety of disabilities, from the Knoxville area. The children, ages 7-22 years old, have disabilities including hearing impairment, visual impairment, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida, ADHD, and autism.  The program is organized, planned, and conducted by 150 University of Tennessee students as part of a course requirement. Dr. Gene Hayes began the camp in 1977 at Virginia Tech. There were 120 students and 60 campers in attendance that first year. Since the first camp, over 2,000 students and 1,200 campers have attended Camp Koinonia.  It is a life changing experience for all who are involved, it is love in skin and bones. 

1. Everyone deserves to play no matter what their physical or mental abilities are.

2. No one should be judged by what they can't do, only praised for what they can do, and taught what they do not know.

3. Anyone can change a life.

4. You learn more by doing, by being, than by reading and writing and testing.

5. Love wins.</description>
