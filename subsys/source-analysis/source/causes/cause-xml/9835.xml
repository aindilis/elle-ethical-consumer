  <description>Do you like cows? Medium-rare? Or well done? Mmmmm...

But in India, the land where some people worship somebody else's lunch, there is a common belief that these delicious meals should be left roaming around the streets or outside temples. This attitude makes restaurants like McDonald's, the world's largest chain of fast food restaurants, not sell their trademark item - hamburgers! Why must we not have the thrill of thinking that the cheese and patty in our burger might have come from the same animal? Not to mention other small time restaurants that don't have steak on the menu!

Many states in India have actually banned slaughter of cattle. They say that the animal is sacred and shouldn't be harmed. What the hell? They pull at cow's tits for some 'curd rice' and they make bulls draw carts and then vouch for their safety? Hypocrites! Give us back our dinner!

Beef-eaters of India.... We must unite! For one huge barbeque! mmmm..... And also to promote the sale of beef in restaurants. Moo!

1. Every person must have the freedom to consume and/or sell beef and its products.

2. McDonald's should start selling Hamburgers in India.

3. It is wrong for food to run around the streets and cause traffic problems.</description>
