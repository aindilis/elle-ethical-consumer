  <description>As Ruth Dunning said, if enough nuclear bombs are detonated nuclear winter will occur.  Therefore this will hault global warming.  We need to send Congress and President Bush a message that we must detonate as many nuclear bombs as possible, preferably over the Middle East and Hollywood, to stop global warming once and for all.

1. To stop global warming.

2. To detonate nukes.

3. To blow up bad places.</description>
