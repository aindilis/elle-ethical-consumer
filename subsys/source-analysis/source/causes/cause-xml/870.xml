  <description>The legitimacy of our electoral system is under sustained attack.  The hijacked 2000 election disenfranchised millions of voters, and serious problems have recurred in every election since.  To make things worse, the extreme right has ginned up the non-existent problem of voter fraud as an excuse to make it harder for people &#8211; especially minorities &#8211; to vote.  Our election system is broken.  People For the American Way Foundation&#8217;s work in the Democracy Campaign addresses this crisis by: promoting progressive election reform legislation in Congress; working with local election officials to resolve potential problems before Election Day; and establishing Election Protection to detect and eliminate problems at the polls on Election Day.

1. Ensure verifiable, secure, and accessible electronic voting machines;

2. Stop intimidation and deceptive practices that keep people away from the ballot box;

3. Eliminate restrictive voter ID requirements that disenfranchise eligible voters without improving the integrity of the elections;

4. Increase overall access to voting through early voting, no-excuse absentee voting, and election day registration;

5. Eliminate restrictions on voter registration that disenfranchise entire communities;

6. Create a uniform process for counting provisional ballots; and

7. Protect minority voting rights.</description>
