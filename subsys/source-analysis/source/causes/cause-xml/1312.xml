  <description>Group B Strep can be prevented. However, many women do not know about testing and the proper time for testing. All pregnant women should be tested between 35 and 37 weeks of pregnancy. Antibiotics during labor can keep babies from suffering from this horrible bacteria. My son was born with Group B Strep July 1, 2005. He had blood transfusions after being air lifted to another facility. He received antibiotics, etc, for 14 days before we could take him home. Before he was air lifted things were not good. I also had an infection. This was all preventable. Thank you to all you share their stories. Please continue to spread the word about GBS.
