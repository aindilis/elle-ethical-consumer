  <description>At Adam Green, we have thoughts. 

But unlike high-price thought consultants, we at Adam Green give our thoughts away for free.  And unlike those reactive thinkers who wait for you to come to them, we are pro-active -- we come to you.

So...imagine that you're walking down the street with your puppy, wondering what people think of you.  You don't have to ask us. We will come right up to you and tell you flat out - that's an ugly puppy.  

Or...imagine you are in Macy's trying on a new pair of jeans and looking at yourself in the mirror.  You turn to your friend to ask her opinion, but she's wandered away. That's ok, because we're there. And we'll tell you -- you look fat.

Join our cult of pro bono philosophy today. We give our opinions, so others don't have to.
