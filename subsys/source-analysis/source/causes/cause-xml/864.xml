  <description>Geneva Convention, 1949:

"No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind."

"Detainee abuse has been widespread. The DAA [Detainee Abuse and Accountability] Project has documented over 330 cases in which U.S. military and civilian personnel are credibly alleged to have abused or killed detainees. These cases involve more than 600 U.S. personnel and over 460 detainees. Allegations have come from U.S. facilities throughout Afghanistan, Iraq and at Guant&#225;namo Bay. (These numbers are conservative and likely lower than the actual number of credible allegations of abuse.)"
