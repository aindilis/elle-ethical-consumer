  <description>With Bush in the White House now, who can say there's not going to be more and more death? Look at this war. Innocent lives, torn apart, every day. George Washington warned us about this. He said the two things America should NOT do is fraternize with foreign countries(alliances, etc) and..i forgot what the other one was, but that's not the point. Sure Iraq needed help, but there are other ways to help other than war!! War is idiotic, it rips lives apart, breeds despair, and is a lose-lose situation. Join the Cause for Peace. Bring back hope for all those who are lost. We were put on this earth to LOVE one another, not brutally murder each other.

1. War is sensless.

2. Bush is an idiot.

3. Peace will solve many many problems.</description>
