  <description>Mark Powell is one of us &#8211; he&#8217;s a genuine Queenslander that has worked hard for everything he has today. 

Mark worked nights and weekends to put himself through a Bachelor of Laws and a Bachelor of International Business at the Queensland University of Technology before starting his career in law with a large Gold Coast law firm. He then went on to work for Federal Member, Steven Ciobo and later as a Business Development Manager for the Asia Pacific region to a global economic and business consulting company. More recently, Mark has pursued an opportunity to join his father in their family business. 

Aged, 29, Mark cites one of his reasons for running for the Senate is because younger Australians are under-represented in Parliament. 

Whilst Mark is based on the Gold Coast, he is regularly on the road travelling from one Queensland town to another as part of the Liberal Party&#8217;s Senate team&#8217;s listening tour of the state.
