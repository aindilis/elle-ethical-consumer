  <description>Unity08 is a diverse group of Americans who believe that neither of today&#8217;s parties reflects the aspirations, concerns or will of the majority of Americans. Both parties have polarized and alienated voters. Both are unduly influenced by single-issue groups. Both are excessively dominated by money. 

Unity08 is committed to presenting a third presidential ticket and platform &#8211; one that addresses the issues and challenges of the 21st Century &#8211; to the American voters in 2008. 

We will not waste time pointing fingers. Instead, we will focus on how America can find common ground on critical issues &#8211; to give the overlooked moderate majority a voice and a choice in 2008. 

1. America must elect two people who can unite the country, rather then divide (like system currently does).

2. Unity '08 will nominate a presidential candidate of one political party and a vice presidential candidate from the other party to run together as a united front commited to improving the country.</description>
