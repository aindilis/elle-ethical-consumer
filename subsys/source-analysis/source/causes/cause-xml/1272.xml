  <description>The Pflugerville High School Panther Band Drumline will be participating in a 24-Hour Drum-A-Thon on June 22nd, in order to raise money for equipment and other supplies.  We are asking the members of the community and local businesses for your financial support to the organization!  This is a great way to support a young generation of talented musicians, for what is sure to be a wonderful year for the Panther Band.

If any business decides to donate any amount to our Drum-A-Thon, please email a company logo to Derek.stoughton@pflugervilleisd.net, and it will be placed on our Drum-A-Thon T-Shirt.  This shirt is part of the official uniform of the PHS Panther Drumline, which means that your company is being promoted at EVERY band function!

Not only is this a fundraising activity, but it is also a teambuilding activity - the students have to work together and figure out how one person is going to be constantly drumming or playing on a keyboard for 24 hours straight.  It's also going to be a chance for us to get to know each other, and start to gel as a percussion section - which is CRUCIAL for success in the marching band!

1. Band enriches the lives of all of it's members.

2. In order for us to be a competing ensemble, we need to have state-of-the-art equipment.</description>
