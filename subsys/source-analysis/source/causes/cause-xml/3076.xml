  <description>Christians are a serious threat to the glory of Rome, for they are against violence, love their neighbours as themselves, and dont like going to war.

Such weakness of mind is a serious threat to the glory of Rome and its conquests, for if it takes root, I fear that Romans will become too weak minded to fight the barbarian hordes.

Come join me in my feeding all Christians to the lions campaign.  If you manage to round up a few, just drop them off at the Colosseum. My lions and tigers will be waiting for them.

Note:  I could not find "Roman Treasury" or "Roman Army" in the list of groups you can donate to. So, I found the nearest thing to the glory of Rome, in this  "Military Pagan Network", although I would prefer if you donated to the Roman Treasury. We could do with a bit more denarii to conquer Caledonia.

1. Rome

2. The Legions
