  <description>Everyday we see the green spaces that we grew up in disappear. We walked, played and explored the green spaces around us. Where have they gone? In a matter months a lush green ecosystem disappears into a pile of dead trees and crushed rock. Then the real work happens, hundreds of homes sprout from the playground turned desert.

Our mission is to stop the destruction of our green spaces. It isn't enough for theses developers to "create" parks for green spaces, what about the bio diversity that was there before.


1. Stop the destruction of green spaces

2. Protect areas from urban sprawl

3. Save trees, plants, and wild life from the bulldozers</description>
