  <description>Michigan may be a powerhouse just about every year, but whne are they ranked at the pre-season number one?  Whne do they get a break during the season and get to the number one spot?  This is dedicated to Michigan Wolverines Football of now and the future and for the fans whole love Michigan more than any other college sports fan!

1. Need to have a recruit like Henne every 2-3 years

2. Need to find more solid defensive players like Branch and Woodley

3. Need to get of the back of coach Carr so he can fulfill all requirements that the U. of Michigan and it's fans demand!</description>
