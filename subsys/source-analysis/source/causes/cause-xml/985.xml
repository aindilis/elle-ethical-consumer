  <description>Philadelphia&#8217;s only social and support network for bisexual people, their families, and friends. We are an all-volunteer program where bisexual, bi-curious and questioning people can express and explore their sexual identity without being judged. We welcome people of all races, classes, ages, religions, genders, sexual orientations and abilities, and we are supportive of celibacy, monogamy, nonmonogamy, polyamory, and other
relationship styles as equally valid.

BiUnity hosts regular discussion groups at William Way on the first and third
Tuesdays from 7 - 9 pm. We also plan social events which in the past have included potlucks, beach trips, film/video screenings, restaurant outings, parties, dances and our fabulous annual Death Bi Chocolate New Year's Day coffeehouse.

1. The mission of the program is to provide support and resources to bisexuals in the Philadelphia community.

2. Also, this cause was added to make bisexuality visible and encourage thought and discussion.

3. Because no other causes listed here mentioned bisexuality explicitly.</description>
