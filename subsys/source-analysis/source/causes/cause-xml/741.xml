  <description>The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee (UUSC) is guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the United Nations in 1948. Our programs are based on Unitarian Universalist principles that affirm the worth, dignity, and human rights of every person.

1. We must promote workers' rights.

2. We must advance the human right to water.

3. We must defend civil liberties.

4. We must preserve the rights of those affected by humanitarian crises.</description>
