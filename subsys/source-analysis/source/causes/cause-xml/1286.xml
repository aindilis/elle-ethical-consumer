  <description>JohnRobert Johnsen was a normal 1 year old. Until he turned about 13 months and he stopped doing all the things he learned. Walking went first, then sitting up, then supporting his head. After an MRI @ A.I. Dupont he was diagnosed with pontine glioma. They went for a 2nd opinion @ CHOP and they confirmed the same diagnoses. 
Pontine Glioma is only about 50 causes nationwide a year and has no cause/ cure. 
JohnRobert is currently being treated at CHOP. He's undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. 

We need a miracle here!
