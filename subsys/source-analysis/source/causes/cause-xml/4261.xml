  <description>As Christians and citizens of the United States of America, we should have the right to publicly pray in schools and to talk about Jesus in the Public School System. But we don't. Our country was founded on Biblical Principals, and it should be be that way forever. All the other religions have freedom to talk about their beliefs, but we don't because we might "offend" someone?" How fair is that? Join this cause if this is your opinion and conviction!

1. Christians should have the right to freedom of speech about God.</description>
