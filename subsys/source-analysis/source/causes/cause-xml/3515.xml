  <description>For many years now I've been collecting money for the MSPCA (Massachusetts Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) and I'm hoping to really make a dent in their efforts to save all these homeless/abused animals.

1. Find homes for abused animals

2. Support growing MSPCA facilities

3. Raise awareness</description>
