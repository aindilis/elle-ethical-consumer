  <description>Diabetes is the 2nd leading causes of death in Canada.
Yes, scientist and doctors are on the edge of finding a cure, but a little money to them will speed it up. I myself am diabetic with juvinile diabetes. Chances are, I can have a kidney failure by the time I have reached 24 years of age, because of my sugar levels. Yes, I understand it's my fault, but just to show you.

I was the unlucky to get juvinile diabetes. To top it off, with type 1. Type 1 is the type where my body can no longer produce insulin. I have to take injections for the rest of my life. There is a type 2, wich means their pancreas' still produce insulin but is using it differently.

Diabetes causes leg loss, strokes, depression, kidney failure, blindness, failure to have an erection, and a serious thyroid disorder. (Thyroids are very important)

Every 30 seconds someone gets diabetes. You might be next in line. Please. Help. Donate. Read. Inform yourself and others about diabetes.
