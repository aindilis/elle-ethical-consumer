  <description>Tibet was illegally invaded in 1950 by the Chinese People's 'Liberation' army. We are dedicated to spreading the word to compel the international community to recognise Tibet's plight. A form of genocide is taking place, with the dilution of the native Tibetan population. The Chinese government is encouraging mass migration of Han Chinese which is effectively destroying Tibet's cultural and racial heritage. Spread the word... Free Tibet!

A serious question must be asked of the international communitee: how can the 2008 Olympics be staged in Beijing with China's terrible human rights record in Tibet? The UN must take a serious look at their own conscience, and decide whether they should be condoning China's actions in Tibet by recognising China's status as a modern state, and not placing sanctions on them until the injustice is stopped. China's occupation continues.
