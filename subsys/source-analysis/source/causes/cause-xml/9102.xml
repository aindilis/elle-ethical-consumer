  <description>These Tortoise are gentle creatures, to lose them would be great lose. They are on threatened list but could quickly become worse due to habitat loss. Developer's for building houses are to blame for this mostly, they are allowed to plow threw and kill tortoises along the away, they try to move out of the way, but can't for they can't move fast enough. 
Worse yet, some try to dig underground, some actually get trapped underground, they don't die for month's at time which is awful away to go. 

Can you find it in your heart to help save them? Here is the link for more information
