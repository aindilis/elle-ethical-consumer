  <description>Does anybody else get pissed off about the fact that there are people who simply talk with music in the background and they get payed more than important people like teachers, etc.? Rap is probably the most disgusting and useless music type out there, and is brainwashing(Sorry, Matt.) many people to leave Rock: the best genre. Rap should stop.

1. Number one best selling hits are people simply talking, rather than people with actual singing talent and/or instrumental talent.

2. Young children are learning explicit language from explicit words in songs.

3. People with important jobs need more education than rap artists, yet they don't get paid as much.</description>
