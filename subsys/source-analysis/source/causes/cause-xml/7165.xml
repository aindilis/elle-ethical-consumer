  <description>We are a group of Chronic Kidney Failure patients and friends that work in order to develop campaigns to promote organ donation and the prevention of chronic diseases.  We also help other chronic patients to improve their quality of life. 

1. There is a need to warn the community about the causes of Chronic Kidney Disease.

2. Panama needs a more agressive promotion of organ donation.

3. All chronic patients in Panama must be able to receive the best attention and medicines available.</description>
