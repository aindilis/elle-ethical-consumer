  <description>     Too often, the tiger, giraffe, dog and even the much maligned penguin are beneficiaries of people's ignorance to otters in the "favorite animal" conversation. We've all had this convo...whether with our little brother or our college classmates; which animal we choose as our favorite determines a lot about who we are. In my case, it has a lot to do with who i'll go out with (maybe a little over the top). 
     Anyhow, it is this group's mission, nay, obligation to end the tyrannical reign of the typical 6 or 7 animals in this important convo. with one secret weapon...the otter. Tell me, what other animal can so cleverly combine fur, fishing, swimming, smashing things with rocks, the face of a kitten, energy, and of course an unrelenting thirst for lovin'. Absolutely none. The otter is without one shred of doubt the sweetest animal ever.
     Maybe terradactyls were cooler.
