  <description>Our goal is to increase the sale of certified rugs to 7 percent; this figure has faces behind it. For every percentage point achieved, 750 children are rescued from the workplace and 1,000 more are saved from entering. In addition, the proceeds from the sale of Rugmark certified rugs supports rescued children. 


The three-year project will ensure the safety and education of 3,800 children and prevent the exploitation of 5,500 more.
