  <description>Alaska's majestic gray wolves are in grave danger. The state has issued permits to aerial gunners and pilots to chase the wolves, run them to exhaustion and shoot them from the air or to land and shoot them at point-blank range. More than 550 wolves have already been killed in this manner over the last three years!

Help us Save America's Wolves! Visit http://action.defenders.org to sign the petition to urge the Bush administration to end the brutal slaughter of these magnificent animals by enforcing the Federal Airborne Hunting Act.
