  <description>The Bhagavad-Gita was spoken to Arjuna the Pandava Prince by Lord Krisna on the battlefield 5000 years ago, it is scripture which integrates the personality of the individual student and makes him capable of facing dynamically all his challenges in life. 

It is a resource of knowledge that can be read and expanded on from verse to verse and the more understanding and studying one does of the Bhagavad-Gita, the more fulfilled and rewarding our lives will become.

Arjuna asks Lord Krisna in Chapter 2

&#8220;O Keshava, what is the nature of the Man of Perfection? What is his inner poise? How does he sit, speak and walk?&#8221;

The question inspires Lord Krisna to answer at length, pointing out the intellectual values of life, the emotional reactions to happenings and the physical responses of the Man of Perfection.
