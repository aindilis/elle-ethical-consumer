KFC crams chickens into dirty factories,  drug them so much that they're too heavy to support their own weight and break their legs. The birds&#8217; throats are cut and then they are dropped into boiling water, often while still alive.

1. It would be illegal for KFC to abuse dogs, cats, pigs, or cows in these ways.

2. No living creature deserves to be abused in such a manner.

3. This is morally wrong!</description>
