  <description>Some people believe that the only type of dance left to man kind are booty shaking and sex like antics.I believe that with the right amount of support WE will be able to make classical dance forms available to the masses and not just upper class chicldren.

1. Dance is a great form of exercise

2. Gets kids off the streets and into a studio

3. Its a great way to make friends </description>
