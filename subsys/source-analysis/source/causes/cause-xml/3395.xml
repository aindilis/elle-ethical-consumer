  <description>The Tyra Show is proud to announce its new &#8220;SO WHAT!&#8221; campaign for women. It&#8217;s for women everywhere who&#8217;ve been counted out or kicked down but had the strength to pull themselves back up. Life is what you make of it, not what you&#8217;re handed. 

"Every woman has something in her life she has to fight to overcome&#8230;whether it&#8217;s a body issue, a relationship crisis, an emotional challenge or a fashion emergency! Rather than wallowing in the negative, why not embrace the positive?&#8221;

I have bad hair days, so what?!
I'm not a size 2, so what?!
I've been single for way too long, so what?!
Every girl deserves to be loved for who she is on the inside.
I'm not perfect, SO WHAT?!



1. Every girl deserves to love herself.

2. You are more than the number, stereotype and position that society has given you.</description>
