  <description>When people come to Pittsburgh due to medical emergences all of the big things such as medical care and housing are taken care of through the hospitals, insurance and other organizations.  All of the small things such as transportation to and from doctors visits, grocery shopping, prescription pick up, daily chores and navigating an unfamiliar city seem to go by the wayside. 

These small things add up quickly and become very stressful for families. Our goal is to provide support and services to help with the little things so families can focus 100% on the recovery process. 


1. No one should have to suffer through an illness alone.  </description>
  <mission>To provide support and care through services in order ease the stress families face when medical emergencies bring them to Pittsburgh for a short or long term stay.</mission>
