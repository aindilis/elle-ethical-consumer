  <description>Rett Syndrome (RS) is a unique neurodevelopmental disorder which begins to show its affects in infancy or early childhood. It is seen almost exclusively in females, although it can occur rarely in boys. It is found in all racial and ethnic groups throughout the world. 


I know a beautiful young girl who is afflicted with this disorder, and I'd like to use this site to help raise awareness, attract families of children with RS so they can network, and even raise money towards research, which will be donated to the Rett Syndrome Research Foundation.  All are welcome to join!
