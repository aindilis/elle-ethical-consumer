  <description>BIMINI BAY RESORT DESTROYS BIMINI

Bimini Bay Resort is a Project of Hilton Hotels Corporation and the Capo Group that is being advertised as an environmentally sensitive Eco-tourist destination. In reality, Bimini bay resort is a scandalous ongoing ecological disaster. 


1. Stop cutting all mangroves. 

2. Restore mangrove ecosytems that have been destroyed already. 

3. Stop construction of the golf course, or build a smaller course on already degraded land on North Bimini or South Bimini and commit to using no pesticides and fertilizers.

4. Restore estuarine streams already damaged by construction. </description>
