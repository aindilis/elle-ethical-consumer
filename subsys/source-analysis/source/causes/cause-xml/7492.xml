  <description>Summer has come and it is time to get out get some sun and get active!! We regard it as common sense that if we become to hot we find shade, if we get thirsty we drink, we feel the burn we put cloths on. If you are like me and have an absolute love and passion for our fur covered friends; please take time to make sure that they are ok. Bring extra water to the park and check water dishes regularly.

Thank you
