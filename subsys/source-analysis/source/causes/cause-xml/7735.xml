  <description>Medicines for Humanity (MFH) is a group of people who believe that no child should die from a lack of basic medicines or primary healthcare.
We strive to make a life and death difference to as many children as possible.

20,000 children die each day from 5 preventable conditions. These conditions could be treated with medicines costing less than a dollar.
