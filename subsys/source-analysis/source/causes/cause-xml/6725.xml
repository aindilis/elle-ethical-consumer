  <description>This fund was started by the Fort Lee Elementary School Number 2's PTA. These donations will be passed along to the Conlon family in one big (I hope) check. The checks should be made out to "School Numebr 2 PTA". The checks should be mailed to 1584 John St. in Fort Lee. All checks will be forwarded to the Conlon family. Please have your checks sent by July 31st, 2007. You may send anything from $.01 to $1,000,000,000. Thanks a lot. All donations will be highly appreciated.  

1. This family doesn't deserve to have to deal with this tragedy.

2. We should all help them.</description>
