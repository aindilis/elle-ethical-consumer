1. This disease is devastating and there needs to be a cure so that people diagnosed do not continue to suffer.

2. We need to raise awareness to the community about PH.  

3. To learn more about this disease and how you can help, go to www.phassociation.org

4. I am starting this group in memory of a friend who lost her life to PH in June of 2006</description>
