  <description>WHY SHOULD YOU BE A DONOR?

CONSIDER THESE STAGGERING FACTS...
# There are 13 million people in the greater New York metropolitan area, the region served by the New York Organ Donor Network.

# Yet, each year, there are only approximately 600 potential, medically suitable deceased organ donors in the region, based on brain-death criteria.*

# In 2006, a year in which there was a record number of organ donors, there were still only 319 deceased organ donors &#8230; a 56% authorization (consent) rate.

# This means that last year, 46 of those approached for organ donation said &#8220;no.&#8221; With such a small pool of donors, any &#8220;yes&#8221; is a huge &#8220;yes.&#8221; Any &#8220;no&#8221; is a devastating &#8220;no.&#8221;

At the same time, on any given day, there are nearly 7,000 people on the organ transplant waiting list in the greater New York metropolitan area alone. Many die waiting because no organs could be found in time.

In addition, there are thousands of people waiting for eyes and tissues such as skin, bone, and heart-valves.
