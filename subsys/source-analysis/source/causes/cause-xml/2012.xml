  <description>I am training for the next 16 weeks to participate in an endurance event that will test my strength, my courage and my will to help the hundreds of thousands of people affected by cancer. I have joined efforts with the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training. All of us on this team are raising funds to fulfill a sole mission: cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, and improve the quality of life of patients and their families. I'm completing this event because I have the strength to help individuals who are battling these diseases.

Because we receive no federal funding, we depend on you for continued support. Anything will help!

Thank you very much for your contribution!
