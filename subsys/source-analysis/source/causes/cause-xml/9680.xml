  <description>In 2005, Rupert Murdoch purchased MySpace for $580m so that he could direct traffic to his other websites.

Rupert Murdoch is the controlling shareholder, chairman and managing director of News Corporation, a huge media conglomerate that owns HarperCollins book publishing, Fox News, Fox Broadcasting (American Idol), Twentienth Century Fox (The Simpsons Movie), the New York Post, as well as many other newspapers and television channels worldwide. He has just purchased the Wall Street Journal, for $5b, which has the second highest circulation in America. 

Fox News is well known for having a horrendous bias in line with Murdoch's own political views. All 175 of his papers' editors expressed support for the war in Iraq.

One man having such incredible power over the minds of the world's people is disquieting, to say the least.

To have a MySpace account is to support Murdoch's empire. Please take a small step towards independent media and show advertisers that the people don't want one man in control of so much information and influence.

1. Media should not be in the hands of the few.

2. Using MySpace gives money and power to News Corp.

3. News Corp. is partially responsible for the War in Iraq.</description>
