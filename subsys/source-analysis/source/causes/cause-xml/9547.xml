  <description>Camp Amelia is an East Palo Alto, California-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to empowering local communities with information technology in order to enhance the quality and accessibility of basic education.

Named for pioneering female aviationist Amelia Earhart, Camp Amelia was established in 2002 by undergraduate and graduate students from Stanford, Harvard, MIT, and Yale to create technologies that level the playing field of educational opportunity. Today, Camp Amelia is still run by university student volunteers who bring tremendous energy, creativity, and dedication to our common objective &#8211; to reduce poverty through technology-based knowledge empowerment.

1. Access to basic education is a human right.

2. Technology can democratize access to information and education.

3. Empowerment through information access and education is our greatest hope for sustainable poverty reduction.</description>
