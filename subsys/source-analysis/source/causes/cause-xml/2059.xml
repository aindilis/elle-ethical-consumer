  <description>BREAK THE SILENCE!

Take Back The Night is a nation wide event, it happens all over the country at all different times. We are going to have one next April, with lots of smaller events and fundraisers and such leading to it. We really want to raise awreness about this event now so we can start to get donations and support and so people know to come! This is for everyone against sexual violent, survivors and supporters, men and women. 

The event is going to be big and powerful. We have a committee dedicating their time for the rest of this year and next planning for this event. Updates will be added as progress occurs. 

If you would like to be part of the committee or get involved in with this in another way, please feel free to messege us. Send this cause to everyone you know, we want to expand for the Cape and make it Mass wide
