  <description>The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) represents 280,000 firefighters protecting 85% of the world's population.  The organization provides for the rights of emergency responders and their families.  This cause is to support their efforts and to donate to the memorial fund for families of firefighters who have given their lives in the line of duty.

Volunteer and professional firemen and emergency medical responders are there for us when we need them.  Show your support for their willingness to serve our communities, and be there for them when they need us.

1. Remember those who have served

2. Respect those who now serve

3. Honor those who have fallen in service</description>
