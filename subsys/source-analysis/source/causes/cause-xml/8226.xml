  <description>My cat had a litter of kittens this april and one of the kittens has two deformed back legs. One of them is twisted and the other faces the wrong direction and is bent. 
The kitten is gettin bigger and has to put more weight on its hind legs which is more painful. When she walks she can not heep a straight line and now is starting to cry when she is putting too much weight on her hind feet.
If we can raise enough money to pay for surgery her hind feet can be altered but if not we will have to put her down.
All the money raised will go toward the surgery and all extra will be donated to local animal hospitals. 

1. To give this kitten a second chance </description>
