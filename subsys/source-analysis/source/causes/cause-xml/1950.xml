  <description>This group is a branch off of a group that i will be starting in some local schools next fall, and i need some support before i get started. This cause is also to try to raise awareness and encourage people i know, and people i don't to take action in any way they can. It's purpose is to raise awareness of the tragic circumstances that are inflicted upon children around the world. Many children are living in poverty, sold as child prostitutes for life, and many of then are infected with HIV. 

The main cause that this group serves is the most important aspect of international poverty. Not having access to clean water. Water is a basic essential for life. More people die from diesease that they catch from drinking the local waste invested water. 

ALL PROCEEDS WILL GO TO Charity:Water, WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT BUILDS WELLS ALL OVER AFRICA TO BRING CLEAN WATER TO THE LOCALS. WHEN YOU HELP OUT YOU ARE SAVING LIVES, LITERALLY JUST THROUGH THE WATER THEY DRINK.

1. Try to make a donation any way you can, 100% goes to the water project .</description>
