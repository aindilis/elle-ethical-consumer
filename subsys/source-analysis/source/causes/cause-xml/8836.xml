  <description>Should the civil authorities pass a national Sunday law because they are pressured by religious powers?


Should individuals be penalized for worshipping on Friday or any other day, or for not worshipping at all?


MANY CHURCH LEADERS and politicians are unified on the hotly debated issue of legislating Sunday as a day of rest. 


Today, great efforts are being made to gain influence in the executive and legislative circles of the United States federal government in order to enact laws for the observance of Sunday as a national day of rest.


It is ironic to see this kind of legislation being promoted when you consider what has been said by the leaders of the Christian churches at different times in history. Considering this, it is also ironic to see what was the practice of Christians throughout history.


In even stronger words, Pope John Paul II in 1998 had asked for more strident measures be taken to insure a day of rest is observed, and to inflict punishment on those who would transgress. Of course, the day that he wants kept is Sunday, regardless of your persuasion. This thought has been passed on to the new Pope Benedict XVI. 


However, is this something that will truly benefit mankind?  Or do Sunday Laws contain the seed of something more sinister?


Could the coming Sunday Laws be in fact the Mark of the Beast that the Bible warns us about?



1. Sunday Laws will be legislated

2. Sunday Laws will be the Mark of the Beast

3. The Vatican and President of the USA will unite to enforce it</description>
