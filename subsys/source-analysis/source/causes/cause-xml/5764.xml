  <description>I know some of you already know but I will be embarking on a 2 month volunteer mission to Guyana with Youth Challenge International. (http://www.yci.org/ ) I&#8217;m really excited and of course very nervous for this insane experience. 

Youth Challenge International (YCI) is a non-profit, non-religious organization that sends young Canadians abroad to affect positive change in developing nations. 

More than half of our costs are covered by the Canadian International Development Agency and other donors. But the remainder comes from volunteer fundraising. I am required to bring with me a contribution to cover my living cost and sufficient funds to operate and to achieve YCI&#8217;s development objectives. 

So I need your help! I need to fundraise like I have never fundraised before!! (I have never fundraised before) :) 
I&#8217;m asking you to please sponsor me. Anything would help me out tremendously! 
If you are interested please get back to me as soon as possible. 
I would like to thank you in advance for considering my proposal. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me. 
Your interest and support means a lot to me and will play a huge role in my success! 

Thanks again
