  <description>In a population of nearly seven million, 66 percent live in poverty, many in extreme misery, especially the indigenous people, women, children and the elderly.

~ Approximately 25,000 children suffer from chronic malnutrition and 36 of every 1000 children die from diarrhea each year.

~ One-fifth of the population cannot read or write.

~ And, only 21 percent of Honduran children finish primary school and a mere four percent have access to a high school education.

Think of your blessings and consider helping the children.

1. Honduran children need hope in their lives and we can provide it.

2. The children are Honduras' future.</description>
