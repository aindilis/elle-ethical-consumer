  <description>Every day 5,000,000 children de from starvation. There are Over 3 million children in America and Mexico alone who havn't been educated, becasue they must work the street. If we can raise money for this cause, we can change children's lives. I am planning on heading over to mexico in march, and my parents will be taking care of America. Depending on how much money we raise, we will build shools, classes, and fun activity programs for children. If we provide breakfast, snack and lunch to these children, then they will be more encouraged to go to school. Education is the key to out worlds future. These children own a paradise, but they live in a hell of violence and conflict. Please help. the smallest donations are appreciated.

1. Children should have hope for their future's. 

2. Just because there are some who have less than other's, does not mean that they should dream les.

3. Eduacate tomarrow's adults.</description>
