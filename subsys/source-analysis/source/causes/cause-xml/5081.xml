  <description>We are cable users who want to let our local cable operators know that we want them to carry the Big Ten Network now! 

That this is a key, important cable channel to carry, and if we are not offered this on our basic cable tier, we will strongly begin looking at alternatives such as DirecTV, which does offer BTN without needing to purchase any additional programming packages.

We want the Big Ten Network Now!

1. fairness

2. consumers should be listened to</description>
