  <description>We lost a loved one, twenty-one years of age. It was a sudden and unfortunate event. We're willing to fight for him, as he did for us.

1. Awareness is important.

2. We love and miss Kenny.

3. Kenny and his family would greatly appreciate this effort.</description>
  <mission>raise awareness about this condition and to comfort others by helping them cope.</mission>
