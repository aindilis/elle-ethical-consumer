1. That those suffering a terminal illness or old age should die with dignity, with love and with care

2. Having lived with my grandmother during her last days in pallative care, I realized how much the staff really cared for their patients (Roseview Manor, Thunder Bay)

3. I saw first hand how too many people in pallative care have no one to visit them, to talk to.  It's important to volunteer your time to share a story or a laugh.  It means everything to these wonderful seniors who contributed so much.</description>
