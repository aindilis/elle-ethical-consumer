  <description>   Any future and long term solution to supply energy to the globe's burgeoning population will have to be met with an investment in renewable energy infrastructure such as wind power, solar power, tidal power, geothermal power, hydropower, methanol, ethanol and biodiesel, or plant derived oils. 

         1) The construction of sufficiently large renewable energy infrastructure might avoid the economic consequences of an extended period of decline in fossil fuel energy supply per capita.
         2) By straying away from our dependence on fossil fuels we also force developing countries to find alternatives ways of making money instead of strip mining (i.e. coal.)
         3) Prevent acidic runoffs, oil spills, corrosion, and of coarse global warming.

    To provide this boon, as well as create the tools to use alternative fuels, research must be focused on the development of technology which minimizes environmental impact, while maximizing efficient energy conversion, in the form of fuel, light and mechanical work.

1. Develop renewable energy sources.

2. Make sustainable through consumer support.</description>
  <mission>The support goes to research for altert tonative and renewable forms of energy and the technology need to develop it.</mission>
