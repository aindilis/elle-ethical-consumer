  <description>The War on Drugs is one of the most egregious manifestations of overreaching government in the United States today. We aim to promote awareness of the Drug War's failings, and to some day eliminate restrictions on drug use.

This cause supports the Students for a Sensible Drug Policy, an organization that works on campuses nationwide to raise awareness of the Drug War's abuses. You can join them here: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204718067

1. The War on Drugs is unwinnable.

2. Violence from drug use and sale is almost wholly a result of prohibition.

3. The War on Drugs has led to an unprecendented curtailing of American civil liberties.

4. It is a fundamental human right to be able to alter one's psyche and body as one sees fit, even if one uses substances deemed 'socially unacceptable'.

5. The prosecution of drug crimes overwhelmingly hurts minority groups and lower socioeconomic classes, and is one of the leading causes of mistrust of the police.

6. The War on Drugs has led to terrible foreign interventions, particularly in Colombia and Afghanistan.

7. The Prohibition must end.</description>
