  <description>It has occured to me how many young children today are born with the horrid disease called "epilepsey" you may also know that this causes seizures in young children and can also lead to nuerotic issues such as tumors and such. My sister was born with epilepsey and doctors say the chances are very high that she will not live past her 16th birthday.
