  <description>My grandfather who i admired and loved died too young from this cancer. He went to little rock, Arkanas to get treated and they gave him 11 more years then expected. In his memory, I want to support everyone who has multiple myeloma. 



1. Curing people is essential to human survival

2. Love those around you, and support them, through everything; CARE</description>
