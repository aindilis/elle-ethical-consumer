  <description>Brain tumors are  now a leading cause of death in our world today. More than half the cases of brain tumors are unknown causes and aren't usually found until after death. Many people have wondered what exactly causes a brain tumor and it's still not quite certain. We have come a long way in the past 20 year in brain tumor studies and it contiues to develop. With this cause I hope to raise awareness about all types of brain tumors not just inoperable ones. Together we can win this fight. For those of you who do not know my father died after a 10 yr bout with an inoperable  brain tumor in jan 2006/ He was having brain surgery to reduce the cists on his brainstem but he died the next day. I want people to know his story and his fight. I dont want this to happen to any one elses family please join our cause.
