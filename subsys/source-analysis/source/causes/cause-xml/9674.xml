  <description>We eat meat, we have lightsabers, we use the force to kill people and its a good time.

Peace is a lie, there is only passion. 
Through passion, I gain strength. 
Through strength, I gain power. 
Through power, I gain victory. 
Through victory, my chains are broken. 
The Force shall free me. 


1. We dont like jedi.  They poison the minds of youth.

2. Only a one time payment of your life.

3. We have big battleships.

4. We eat our dead.

5. We can fly.

6. We can fly while choking people.

7. The jedi suck....we PWN NOOBS...force lightning.

8. We live in a giant ball....aka Death Star.</description>
