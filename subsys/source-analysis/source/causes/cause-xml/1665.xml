  <description>The genocide committed against the Circassian nation by Czarist Russia in the 1800s was the biggest genocide of the nineteenth century. Yet it has been almost entirely forgotten by later history, while everyone knows the later Jewish Holocaust and many have heard about the Armenian genocide. "Rather than of separate, selectively researched genocides, we should speak of a general genocidal tendency that affected many &#8211; both Muslim and Christian &#8211; people on a wide scene between 1856 and 1956, continuing in post-Soviet Russia until today",
