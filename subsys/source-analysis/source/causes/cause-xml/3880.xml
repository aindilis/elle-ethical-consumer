  <description>PLEASE DO NOT DONATE. There isn't any way I can start anything, I'm just in it for the awareness. 
I get so angry when I hear somebody call somebody else or something a "Jew" or a "Muslim", just because they don't like it. It's ridiculous, and extremely offensive. It needs to be stopped.

1. Stop people from using religions as "bad words".

2. Teach people how to respect religions other than their own, even if they have none.</description>
  <mission>create a better understanding of all religions, and stop people from using them as a term of offense.</mission>
