  <description>So here's the deal. Life Teen is all about awesome Catholic youth ministry. Leading teens closer to Christ. This summer I am volunteering as part of their summer camp staff, meaning that this is my summer job that I'm not getting paid for. And on top of that, I have to pay for my own plane tickets to Georgia and Arizona. I signed up to volunteer knowing that, in the end, like always, God would provide.

The thing that I'm most excited about is that we will be receiving practical youth ministry training and experience with leading summer camp retreats and activities which I've been aching to learn more about. Plus I'm going to get to work with kids all summer, have fun, talk about God, do Catholic summer camp stuff. lol

I'm asking you to do one thing for me. Please pray for me. Pray that I will gain as much knowledge and experience as I can in order to continue with my current involvement in youth ministry at St. John the Baptist in Milwaukie, Oregon. Pray that I will help lead teens closer to Christ. Pray for the campers, and my fellow staff members, that everything will go smoothly and according to plans.

Thank you,
Andrew Havens
