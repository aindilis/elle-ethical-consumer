  <description>We want the fashion industry, society, men, and potential mothers-in-law to stop fostering the message that skeleton-skinny is beautiful or fashionable. 

Women and girls need to eat the right foods to be healthy, contributing members of society, regardless. Young girls especially need to eat right in order to develop and grow properly. 

Choose your own ideas and beliefs, and don't let the world dictate your appearance and actions. 

Anorexia and other eating disorders are a terrible result of the fashion industry's promotion of super skinny models. The majority of females born on this planet are genetically not going to have a body type of 5'10" and a size 2. 

And especially for future mothers-in-law: don't influence your son to only want a skinny girl. Don't require it. Require your daughter-in-law to be healthy, attractive, dignified and have integrity. Limiting your sons' prospective wives to a 34-26-34 is damaging to him as well as to all young women. 

1. The fashion industry and the world must stop promoting unhealthy body types. 

2. Promote eating nutritiously and emphasize self-worth based on inner values and actions.

3. Health and productivity is more important than fitting into a size 2.</description>
