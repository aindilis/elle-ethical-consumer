  <description>In today's world peanut allergies are growing to be a concern for our youth and adults. Big corperations are refusing to process their products in a peanut free facility, there by not making it safe for all buyers to consume. 

Large business's need to know that this will be a positive step forward in the sale of their products.

We would like to promote awareness to Tim Horton's most importantly to follow the footsteps in companies such as DARE, CHAPMAN's, QUACKER, and NESTLE.

1. The rate of peanut allergies are growing every year

2. The smell of a peanut alone can send a person into having an attack

3. Becoming peanut free means more people can enjoy the products thereby increasing sales and revenue</description>
