  <description>Students for Saving Social Security is a grassroots network on college campuses across the country. We represent the interests of our generation by advocating for genuine Social Security reform through personal ownership.
 
It has become obvious that the controversy over the future of Social Security lacks balance: the opinions and welfare of young Americans have been relegated to the fringe of the debate. As college students, we are preparing to enter the workplace as contributors to the Social Security program. Our very first paychecks will be taxed for a system that cannot fulfill its promises to us.
 
This is not merely a distant crisis concerning retirement benefits. The immediacy of the problem for our generation is pressing: Social Security reform affects us now. On Social Security reform hinge numerous issues of vital and immediate importance to us: the ability of employers to hire us as we graduate, the opportunity to save for our future, and economic growth and prosperity in the years ahead.
 
Students for Saving Social Security will lead the charge to inform, organize, and mobilize today's college students to engage in the Social Security debate. Through honest, non-partisan debate we hope to represent the interests of young Americans. We want politicians to understand that an entire generation of voters can be won &#8211; or lost &#8211; on an issue with lasting implications for our future.
