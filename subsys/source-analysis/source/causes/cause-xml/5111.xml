  <description>EMI is a Christian ministry that designs facilities that serve the poor in developing countries. These facilities (including buildings, roads, clean water projects and more) directly impact communities by meeting physical needs and communicating God&#8217;s love in a practical way. EMI partners with missionaries, pastors, and other non-profits who have a vision to help the poor and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. From their offices around the world, over 70 staff and interns labor to bring the Gospel to the poorest and least reached peoples on earth. 

To produce our designs, EMI blends a team of in-house project managers with talented volunteer engineers, architects, land surveyors and construction managers recruited from around the world. These volunteers donate their time and travel costs to join our teams, adding their expertise and insight to give our clients the best designs possible.
