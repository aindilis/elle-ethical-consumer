  <description>We sell high quality hand knit shoes made in Iraq to save kids made in Iraq who are dying every day simply because of the fact that they can't afford heart surgery.   We sell shoes, take as much of the proceeds as we can and help send Iraqi kids to Jordan to receive live saving surgery. It's a race. Not against Nike or Birkenstock. We're up against Time and Inevitability to sell enough shoes before more kids in our neighborhood die from a lack of medical care. Run along side us.
