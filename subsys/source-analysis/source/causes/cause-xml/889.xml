  <description>Today, the rights of individuals are being eroded: by government, by corporations, by society itself. This icon &#8212; the Individual-i &#8212; represents the rights of the individual.

It represents the right to privacy and anonymity in the information age. It represents the rights to an open government, due process, and equal protection under the law. It represents the right to live surveillance free, and not to be marked as "suspicious" for wanting these other rights.

It recognizes that a free society is a safe society, and that freedom is founded upon individual rights.

The battle for individual rights is just beginning; our side needs a symbol.

We hope to see this symbol displayed proudly wherever individual rights are valued. 
Symbol and original mission statement is located at individual-i.com.
Reminders that we are each individuals are the first step to defeating group thinking and mob mentalities.

1. Protect personal privacy.

2. Ensure anonymity and freedom from surveillance.

3. Stand guard for our rights to read, think, speak, associate, and travel.

4. Uphold the right to dissent.

5. Regain the rights to make your own choices about sex, reproduction, marriage, and death.

6. Reclaim our rights for due process.

7. Maintain our equal protection laws and promote pathways that allow for redress of grievances.</description>
