  <description>ACT: Autism Can Triumph is my community service platform. I advocate educating the community on the signs and symptoms of autism, advocating early intervention upon recognizing these signs, and educating the community on the signs and symptoms of autism.

1. Autism has reached epidemic proportions. We must act.

2. Autistic children all deserve top of the science treatments and therapies

3. Parents deserve support and guidance.</description>
