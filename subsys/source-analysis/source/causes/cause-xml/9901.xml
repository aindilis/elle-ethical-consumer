  <description>I am a cute Bernese Mountain Dog pup (see photos on my page - search for Maximus Hodgson-Jones), with a more than adequate set of testicles, and my evil twisted mother wants to lop 'em off! Please join my cause as soon as possible and SAVE MY SACK...

1. They're my nuts, not hers...

2. I need something to lick / scratch...

3. Anyone want my puppies?</description>
