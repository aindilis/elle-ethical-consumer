  <description>WPA is a cause to help those who are in need of help.
for example: homless shelters, women's and children's shelters, foster home's, child adoption shelters,
and even animal shelters and fighting deforestation. 
   like.. as your walking down the street and see a homless person, give then some coins or go to McDonald's and buy one of those cuopnthings for five dolors...
or going out and picking up trash that you find on the street. 
 

you know... something to make the world a little better everyday

1. Everyone should have health care food and a home.

2. Deforestation is slowly killing the earth and must be stopped somehow.

3. Animals are people too and should be treated with respect.</description>
