  <description>Now that we are entering semester once again the thursday night population has rapidly declined. Lame ass people can now play the "back at UNI" card and think its ok to be gay about it and stay home.

There was once a time where thursday nights rivalled the greatness of a saturday night. But is just once a week now. Is that really enough, honestly! with incentives like free acholol on thursdays! yes free for 2 hours (at stocky). Why not go out get loose with mates/meet new peoples/pulls chicks/dudes and have an awesome time, your only going to be young once people and im sure you can spare a few hours that you probably wouldnt use to study anyways. I know i dont.

This Groups aims to make thursdays awesome again
by whatever means nessacary. That includes publically naming and shaming those who pike!

so have fun and ill see you on the thursday night curcuit.

1. To Make Thursday Always Awsome!

3. Good times are complusary</description>
