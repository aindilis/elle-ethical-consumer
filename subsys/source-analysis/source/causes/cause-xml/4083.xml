  <description>Because of the increased in awarness of the climate change issue people are now trying to make a diffrence. But Lets be honest the changes we art making now should have been done 15 years ago. We are only prolonging the inevitable. The deductions made by turning green compare to nothing as long as the rest of the worlds goverments keep up the same economic output. But if we increase use of all harmfull products to the environment it will speed up the gobal warming cycle and goverment entities will have no choice but to react with drastic social change.
