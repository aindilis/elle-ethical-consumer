Successful Australian hearing implant manufacturer Cochlear, continues to ignore the wishes of its workforce to be represented by their union, locking the Australian Manufacturing Workers&#8217; Union out of wage negotiations. In two secret ballots conducted by the AMWU workers overwhelmingly called upon Cochlear to negotiate with the Union. Cochlear workers have also twice rejected the company&#8217;s attempts to force them into a non-union agreement. Cochlear is deaf to their wishes&#8217; Cochlear workers have now been denied their annual pay rise because of their demand for union representation. 

Australia&#8217;s unfair industrial relations legislation doesn&#8217;t give workers who want a union agreement any bargaining rights. Cochlear workers have commenced a campaign to restore their rights to a fair deal negotiated by their Union. 


Message to Cochlear

Cochlear workers are proud of their company. They are proud of the good work that they do in helping families world-wide hear. All they ask for is that Cochlear listen to their wishes, and respect their decision
