  <description>This group is dedicated to saving "the Daynay" by raising funds to help pay her self-inflicted high-maintenance impulse-bought spending-spree debts. Only from those that care about her can she be saved, and by making a small sacrifice we can once again restore order in her life.

Plus, she's good-looking.
