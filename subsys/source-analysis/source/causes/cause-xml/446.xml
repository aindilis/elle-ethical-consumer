  <description>Cystic Fibrosis is a genetic disease that affects millions of people all over the world. CF causes certain glands to not work correctly, causing the lungs to become congested with mucus and the pancreas to be blocked so digestive enzymes cannot be released.

CF patients, especially at young ages, are frequently hospitalized. Nowadays, someone with CF generally lives into their mid-thirties, but scientists are making progress and there are currently dozens of treatment is in the testing phase. No cure has been found yet.

Cystic Fibrosis may be a chronic, life-altering disease with harmful effects, but people with CF can still live a normal lifestyle, and there is hope for a medical breakthrough in the future. Cystic Fibrosis might not be significant in a majority of people&#8217;s lives, but for those who it does affect, it&#8217;s not just a disease: it's a way of life. But one day soon, maybe it won&#8217;t be a lifestyle anymore. Maybe it will be cured, and only known as something that affected people in the past.

With your support, we can reach that cure faster, and wipe out this disease for good!

1. We need to find a cure for Cystic Fibrosis.

2. Nobody deserves to have their life controlled by a disease. There is so much in life that CF patients don't get to experience, and that needs to change.</description>
