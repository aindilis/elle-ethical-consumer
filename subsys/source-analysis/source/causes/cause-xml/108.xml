  <description>At the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000, 191 Heads of Government promised to end poverty by 2015. They signed the Millennium Declaration, promising to &#8220;free men, women, and children from the dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty&#8221;, committing developed and developing countries alike to eight Millennium Development Goals.
 
All 8 United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG) are connected, and success or failure of any one affects the other goals being achieved.  The sum is greater than all of the parts.

1. Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger

2. Goal 2: Achieve Universal Primary Education

3. Goal 3: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women

4. Goal 4: Reduce Child Mortality

5. Goal 5: Improve Maternal Health

6. Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases

7. Goal 7: Ensure Environmental Sustainability

8. Goal 8: Develop A Global Partnership For Development</description>
