  <description>West Pines United FC is a local travel soccer club based in Pembroke Pines. Last weekend the U-18 boys achieved the highest nor at the state level by wining the Florida State Cup in exciting fashion. It is the fulfilment of a dream bgun 7 years ago when the team was first formed, and made even more memorable because all except two of these young men are seniors completing their high school carrersand going on to college.
This achievement makes our team eligible to compete in the Southern Regional Championships to take place June 28th to july 4th in Oklahoma city. The tournament will expose our players to over 3,000 college coaches who may offer any one of them scholarships. It is a very important occasion for our young men, and when we are successful in claiming the title of Southern Regional Champs, we will earn a berth in the U.S. National Tournament to vie for the title of #1 in the nation.
But our estimate costs are: $16,400. This includes Airfare Hotel Transportation and Meals for the whole team.
We would greatly appreciate any contribution, big or small. Please help out.
Thank you

1. Our players deserve an opportunity to be expose to college scouts</description>
