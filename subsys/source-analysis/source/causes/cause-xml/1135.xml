  <description>This week delegates from 171 countries will be assembling in the Netherlands for a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

One of the topics being covered will be a discussion on whether China should lift its ban on the trading of tiger parts.

Even a partial lift of this ban can prove as a serious threat to the population of tigers all over the world and would eventually lead to the extinction of these magnificent creatures much sooner than expected.
