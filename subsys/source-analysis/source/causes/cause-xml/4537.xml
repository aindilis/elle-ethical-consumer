  <description>Oasis Kenya is a mission approx. 15 miles from Nairobi, Kenya and Kibera (the largest slum in Africa). The Kenyan pastor who is running this mission is working to reach the people of Kenya for Jesus Christ and starting a health clinic for so many Africans who are dying from treatable disease and poor sanitation and nutrition.

1. John 3:16-17 "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. God did not send His son into the world to condemn it but to save it through Him"

2. The Great Commandment: "Love the Lord with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. Love your neighbor like yourself."</description>
