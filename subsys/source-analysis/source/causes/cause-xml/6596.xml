Child soldiers in Africa. 
Poverty orldwide. 
The AIDS epidemic. 
Modern-day slavery. 
Homeless orphans. 
Grieving widows. 
Depression. Addiction. Oppression. Shame. Guilt. Violence. Hate. Suffering...

The only force in this world powerful enough to conquer these issues is love.
The only people that can give it is us.
The only time to do it is now.
