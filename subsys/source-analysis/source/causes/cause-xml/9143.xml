  <description>For those of you who don't know what Cerebral Palsy (CP) is it is a physical disability in human develpment. My sister has CP. She was given CP because was a premature baby who did not receive enough oxygen to her brain at birth. Because of that she has no white matter in the back of her brain impairing her motor skills. Although Cerebral Palsy does not let people walk, it doesn't make them not love, care, and be a member of society. Every person i have met with CP deserves the opportunity to play sports, walk around, and do all the things that "a normal person" can do. Please help the fight against Cerebral Palsy
