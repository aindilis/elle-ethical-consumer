  <description>Back in the 1930's the innovative menstrual cup was invented as a form of internal feminine protection. The DivaCup&#8482; is a modern version of this proven concept that has been redesigned with the latest technology in moulding and materials.

The DivaCup&#8482; is cleared for marketing by the FDA (USA), and holds a current Health Canada medical device license. It is made of soft medical grade silicone, which is latex-free, 100% hypoallergenic and odorless. For over 50 years, silicone has been safely and extensively used in products for the health care industry.

Since The DivaCup&#8482; is reusable, it is very economical. As well, you can feel confident that you are doing your part in environmental conservation. Landfill and pollution problems are on the rise and continue to be a worldwide concern. In 1998, 7 billion tampons and 13 billion sanitary pads and their packaging made their way into landfills and sewage systems in the USA alone!
