  <description>Because of my passion for our youth and my desire to reach out to them, I, Caitlin Cunningham, founded The Understand Your Worth Organization: A cause devoted to encouraging young people to become involved in some type of community service. Whether it be raising money for a good cause, volunteering at the local animal shelter, or staying late after school to help a teacher, I truly believe that the more an individual is able to help others, the more sense of worth he or she will have. And a person who knows his or her own worth has neverending potential to do great things. I am where I am today thanks to the constant support I've had from those around me to do good and because of the positive impact I've had the opportunity to make in the lives of others. I can only hope that others can be as fortunate. Please join me in inspiring young people to make a difference.

1. A sense of self-worth leads to determination.

2. Children need to know that being young does NOT make them incapable of changing lives for the better.

3. You have the freedom to choose to be someone.</description>
