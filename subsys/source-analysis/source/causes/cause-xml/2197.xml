August 21st and 22nd, 2007, Montebello, QC - 

A mass demonstrations and disruptions to denounce and derail the meeting for the Security and
Prosperity Partnership (SPP), and the state visits to Quebec of George W. Bush, Stephen Harper, and Felipe Calder&#243;n.  

The heads of state of Canada, the US and Mexico are meeting at Ch&#226;teau Montebello, in the Outaouais, the 21st and 22nd of August, to pursue the economic and security integration of North America.  Block the Empire! Montreal and
the Stop SPP Action Committee of Ottawa are calling for direct action against the SPP meeting at Montebello.

Please do not donate...I had to pick a donar and although "doctors Without Borders" is a great cause, I just wanted to highlight the action.
