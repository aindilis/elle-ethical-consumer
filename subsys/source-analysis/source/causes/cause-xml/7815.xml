Marc Emery, Michelle Rainey, and Greg Williams are marijuana activists in Canada. Marc Emery is the editor of a popular magazine, Cannabis Culture, and leader of The BC Marijuana Party, a registered political party that has participated in elections since 2001.

The three are accused of selling marijuana seeds, indicted for "Conspiracy to manufacture marijuana", "Conspiracy to distribute marijuana seeds", and "Conspiracy to launder money".  The US government wants Canada to extradite them to serve 10 years to life in US prison.

Many Canadians (and Americans, and people all over the world) think this is wrong. The BC3 are Canadians who did not go to the US and haven't even committed any serious crimes. They never grew or sold marijuana or any drugs.

Please raise awareness and help save three Canadian cannabis and political activists from extradition to the US. Visit www.NoExtradition.net for more information and petitions, pamphlets, handouts, and other ways so help.

1. The Justice Minister of Canada should refuse to extradite Marc Emery, Michelle Rainey, and Greg Williams

2. Canada shouldn't extradite their citizens to the United States for activities carried out in Canada

3. The sale of cannabis seeds in Canada has only been punished with a $1,000 fine and, more recently, one month in jail

4. "The continued prohibition of cannabis jeopardizes the health and well-being of Canadians much more than does the substance itself" SenateReport.ca</description>
