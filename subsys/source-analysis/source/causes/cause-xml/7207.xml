A groundswell of new suppport

Twenty-five dollars really doesn't sound like that much money. It's about the cost of a new DVD. It's a few movie tickets. It's a t-shirt from the mall. But when Chi Phi receives $25 from a new donor, it's a lot. When it comes from an especially young new donor, it's enormous. 

Chi Phi re-launched the Men of 1824 program, a grassroots fundraising effort reserved for undergraduates and young alumni. The idea behind the program is simple: that by adding lots of young givers today, Chi Phi's future contributor base (and its future contributions!) will be even bigger tomorrow. 

The Men of 1824 program is an opportunity designed for every undergraduate and is targeted at alumni within five years of graduation. This year, we've seen a groundswell of new support-only two months into the 2006-07 fiscal year!-and we've seen many men representing nearly two thirds of Chi Phi Chapters become part of our long-term fundraising solution.
