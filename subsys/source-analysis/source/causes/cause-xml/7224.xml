  <description>HERO is a UNA-USA Campaign, in partnership with The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), is an awareness building and fundraising initiative dedicated to providing comprehensive, school-based support to orphans and vulnerable children living in HIV/AIDS-affected communities in Africa.

HERO is also working in schools within Ethiopia, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia to reduce the negative impact of poverty and HIV/AIDS on children.

Children are routinely subject to misfortune beyond the loss of parents. They are at higher risk of being malnourished, sexually and physically abused, stigmatized and forced to work to support themselves and remaining family members. HERO has identified staying in school as the first line of defense against these ills. By enrolling in school, children whose welfare might otherwise be overlooked can gain access to services provided by the community and government.

Along with our in-country partners, HERO strives to strengthen the schools' response to their most vulnerable learners and provide a comprehensive solution. Each school is provided with a comprehensive "HERO Package" of support that is implemented by local partners at schools serving children from pre-school through 12th grade.
