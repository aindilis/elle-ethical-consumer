  <description>Moon Bears have been kept in small cramped places. Our goal is to free them and set them free in the open wide spaces! 

1. THEY HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP IN SMALL CAGES FOR YEARS NOT BEING ABLE TO GROW!

2. THERE BILE HAS BEEN DRWN OUT OF THERE BODIES!

3. THEY NEED THE OPEN SPACE AND FRESH AIR!</description>
