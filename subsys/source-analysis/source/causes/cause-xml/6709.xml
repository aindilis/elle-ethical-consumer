  <description>Keep America's healthcare system out of the hands of the government who brought you those bastions of efficiency:  (i) the post office and (ii) the VA health system.

If you would like for your entire health care system to resemble Walter Reed Medical Center and the VA health system, go ahead and support Michael Moore's idea of putting your personal health in the hands of the government.

If you would like a group of un-fire-able civil servants working toward their pensions to control your health care, then government controlled health care is just the ticket!  

How about if we tighten the security net, instead of tearing down an entire system that is the best in the world.  

1. The health care system is not perfect.

2. It can be improved without throwing the baby out with the bath water.

3. In any case, the government will never provide a better system than competition-based private industry.</description>
