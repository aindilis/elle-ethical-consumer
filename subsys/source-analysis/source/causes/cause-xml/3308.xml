  <description>For all those soldiers who have not returned from Prisoner of War camps, and those who have gone Missing in Action in the line of duty. We remember the sacrifices of these heroes and their families.

1. Spread awareness of the POW/MIA cause

2. Commemorate all of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines who have never returned to their native soil after serving their country with distinction

3. Help people realize that there are hundreds of soldiers who have never returned for a proper burial in the U.S. and their families suffer from this lack of closure. </description>
