  <description>Everyday there are more houses being built, but why? I can promise you that just last week there were 3 houses that i drove by and no one is living in them... yet two streets down... they're building a new subdivision. Why keep building more of the EXACT same thing? In the process of building these EMPTY houses they are tearing down other homes, the animals homes. They are tearing down beautiful forests and farmlands. Without farms we have an even larger unemployment percentage. And in the process of tearing down forests we are causing major harm to  our lives... HELLO WE NEED THOSE TREES!!

1. Wildlife has rights too.

2. Save our forests!</description>
