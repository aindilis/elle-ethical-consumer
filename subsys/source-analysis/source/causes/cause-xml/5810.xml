FILL OUT A FOSTER APPLICATION AND START HELPING KITTENS AND PREGNANT CATS :) THEY NEED YOUR HELP RIGHT NOW!!

I have fostered a mother and her kittens they are only a week old right now (adoptable on August 28th) But you have to go through ME if you want one :P Just let me know! 

UPCOMING EVENTS IN VANCOUVER:
Feast of Fields: UBC Farm September 9th from 1-5pm
Paws for A Cause: Vanier Park September 9th from 10am -- noon 
Capers Living Naturally Fair: at the Robson Capers on September 15 and 16th


All donations will be given to OUR LOCAL shelters! :) Majority of animal causes are Canadian and United States- but I figure people help more when they feel they are helping their own communities! 

1. Animals shouldn't feel discomfort;

2. Animals need to be fostered and adopted out asap;

3. Materials and supplies are always needed in Shelters;

4. Rather than purchasing a new kitten/puppy better advertising for adoption is needed.</description>
