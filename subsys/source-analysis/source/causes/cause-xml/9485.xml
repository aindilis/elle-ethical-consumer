  <description>Hi everyone,

My sister and I are doing a fundraiser for children with Cancer at the Calgary Children's Hospital and also the Tom Baker Cancer Centre-- Our goal is to raise $2000 which will be matched by our parents to buy all kinds of toys. DVDs, Crayons, Books and so on for the under 18 at the out patience department of the centre.

There is no "EVENT" or a set date so please feel free to contact me and send your donations at any time, preferably by Sep 15

As you all know I've had a reason to be around these wonderful people for the past little while and also volunteer there to talk to them and know what can make their stay a little bit less stressful for them and help them get through the illness and beat cancer.

All donations are welcome from $1 to whatever you can afford, (Children's books, DVDs, etc) and is very much appreciated --- we are hopeing to raise this amount by Sep 15, 2007.

Once again I thank you all very much and hope you be able to contribute, anyway that's convenient for you and I thank those who have already made donations.

Remember every little bit helps, 
Thank you very much and please feel free to contact me on how to donate or contribute,

You can also mail me anything you like at
