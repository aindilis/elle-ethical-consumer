  <description>With only a few left remaining in the wild due to drugs, cirrhosis, aids and mental retardation - this rare species is on a harsh road to extinction if there is not any action done immediately.

The World Wildlife Fund has announced at a news briefing recently that there are only 25-34 of these graceful creatures still living in the wild; a major decline since the beginning of the 20th century when there had been several thousand Miramontes.

There is some good news. The Miramontes can make a comeback if there is immediate action done to save them.

Please, don't let these rare creatures dissappear! Something must be done!

1. We must understand the Miramontes.

2. We must not judge the Miramontes.</description>
