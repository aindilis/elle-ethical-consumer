  <description>Seeing through race, religion, sexual preference, gender, nationality, handicaps, and age!  We can't hate others just because they are different from us!  I won't hate you becaus you have different skin, or worship another god.  Or because you are gay, or have AIDS or Down's Syndrome.  We don't need to bully each other, or fight each other, or kill each other.  We are all people.  We all have thoughts and feelings and ideas and emotions.  We can live together in peace and harmony.

1. Stop iscrimination due to: race, religion, sexual preference, gender, nationality, handicaps, age, education, et cetera.</description>
