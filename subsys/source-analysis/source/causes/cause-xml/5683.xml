  <description>(Imran Khan's letter of appeal when earthquake hit Pakistan)



Dear All, 

The greatest tragedy has gripped our nation and its innocent people. Since the pain we see can be touched and felt even from a distance we must do what we can to try revive what is left of their lives! As you read this, people especially children are dying because of starvation, homelessness, extreme weather conditions, lack of medical aid and severe injuries to name just a few caused by this unimaginable mass catastrophe. 

The Imran Khan Foundation, The Imran Khan Earthquake Relief Fund and Shaukat Khanum Hospital and Trust have established tent cities, Camp hospitals and temporary housing to give shelter and provide aid to the victims of this enormous tragedy. 

We need all your help to keep these efforts going. Please donate generously and help us save these innocent, precious and desperate lives. We shall keep you appraised of further developments. 

Thank you, 
 

(Imran Khan)
