  <description>In my opinion it is incorrect to allow any type of corporal punishment against children.
Children need to be loved and protected not beaten, the law as it stands allows reasonable chastisment of children.  However, this is very ambiguous.  What do we call reasonable?  Reasonable in the eyes of the law means to smack without leaving any marks or bruising, what if the child is black, how can we tell then?
The levels of domestic violence in the UK is soaring, how can we expect to kerb such statistics when we are teaching our children right from wrong by corporal punishment of any form and yes that does mean a smack.  If an adult smacked another adult they could be charged with assault and battery; however, if a child's parent smacks them it is acceptable!!!
If we continue to treat our children in such a manner how can we expect the situation to improve.  
Are we breeding a violent country by smacking our children?  It is very convenient to blame television but I think the answer lies deeper seated than that.  If our children have violence of any kind used against them how are they going to know that it is wrong to use it in adult life?
Think about it - you know it makes sense.

1. Violence against our most vulnerable citizens should be bought to an end immediately

2. Our children need to be protected not beaten

3. Behaviour is better taught through reinforcement of good behaviour rather than punishment against bad</description>
