  <description>The Berkana Institute works in partnership with a rich diversity of people around the world who strengthen their communities by working with the wisdom and wealth already present in their people, traditions and environment. As pioneers, we do not deny or flee from our global crisis. We respond by moving courageously into the future now, experimenting with many different solutions.

Berkana and our partners share the clarity that whatever the problem, community is the answer. We prepare for an unknown future by creating strong and sustainable relationships, by wisely stewarding the earth&#8217;s resources, and by building resilient communities. We rely on the belief that human beings are caring, generous and want to be together.


1. Berkana serves the vision of a world where people experience themselves as whole, healthy, sacred and free.

2. Start anywhere, follow it everywhere.</description>
