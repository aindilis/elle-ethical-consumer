  <description>There are millions of children suffering from cancer. 10% of those children will die because they have cancer within the next year. We rarely see these children because they have to be hospitalized. They children lay in there hospital beds day to day wondering if they'll be alive long enough to see the day that they graduate from high school. They wonder if they'll be alive long enough to go on their first date. Some even wonder if they'll be alive long enough to see the next day. Just imagine wondering that. All they want to do is grow up. They want to be firemen, teachers, actors, doctors, parents. It's sad that any child of any age has to face that imagine being in that position or being the mother or father of the child. It's really sad but it's reality but sometimes reality changes. This cause was started so reality could be changed and if we all work together i have pride that we will succeed. Help the children of the world. Join the cause to cure children's cancer!

1. Children deserve to see tomorrow

2. We must further the research to cure cancer

3. There is a cure for every cancer but we need money to do so</description>
