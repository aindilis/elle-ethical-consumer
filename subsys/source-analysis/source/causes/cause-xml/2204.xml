  <description>Football Is A Beautiful Game . Chelsea's Style Of Playing Football Isn't. It Is Just Polluting The Great Game Of Football . Chelsea Have Won Because They Had The Money. They Have Spent Nearly 400 Million In The Transfer Market. Their Success Has Been Bought, They Don't Deserve To be Crowned Champions For Two Years. Basically All You People Who Support Chelsea Need To Realize The Truth That Chelsea Sucks! And Need To Stop Suppoting Chelsea.

1. Drogba, Lampard And Terry Are Fucking Disgusting

2. Stamford Bridge smells like piss

3. Shevchenko is in the club coz he can speak Russian, no wonder Abrambhovic sacked Mourinho

4. Shevchenko and Ballack are used worse than waterboys like in cricket

5. Shevchenko is the 30 million pound translator!

6. Chelsea's coach Avrham Grant doesnt have a UEFA coaching license</description>
