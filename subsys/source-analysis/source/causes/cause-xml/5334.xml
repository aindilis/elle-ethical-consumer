  <description>Any donations (money, food, gas, objects of significant value, etc.) will be accepted.  To put it simply.  I need money.  I can't do all of the things that I want to and I'm pissed because of it.  I want a bigger apartment, some new clothes, a high paying job and car that runs on starlight.  Please, lets nip poverty in the bud and stop my downward slide into homelessness before it even begins.
