  <description>Dedicated to Finding a Cure
Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) is the leading charitable funder and advocate of Type 1 diabetes research worldwide. The mission of JDRF is to find a cure for diabetes and its complications through the support of research. JDRF has brought the long struggle against diabetes and its complications to a turning point.

My father has been a diabetic from the young age of 5.  He was told he would never see his 20th birthday, or have kid's.  I am proud to say, through research, not only has my dad had two kids, but he will proudly turn 60 this year!  My best friend was diagnosed with the disease just over a year ago.  With her progression, I have been able to see first hand, just how much technology has changed through research!  I am a firm believe in this cause!  I hope you can find it in your hearts to be one as well!  This disease has touched many lives, perhaps you and I can stop its course!
