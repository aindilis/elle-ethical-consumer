  <description>We are spreading the gospel to those that cannot come to church because of transportation, health or financial issues. We are changing the lives and souls of those that have been rejected by society, church and government. We are empowering with knowledge the lives of those that had been deceived by the lies of Satan. We are bringing deliverance to those in spiritual bondage. We are helping those that have been victims of rape, abuse, and racial abuse. We are the advocates of those that have no strength to keep walking and are ready to give up life.

1. Hate crimes must stop, we all are God's children

2. Child abuse needs to be addressed with love and kindness not with political views.

3. The answer to our problems is JESUS!

4. Racism is not in the bible and is not acceptable by God, therefore it must be eliminated from this society!</description>
