  <description>This is a basic cause to express your need to eliminate the last couple of weeks of school.  You know they are pretty pointless, annoying, sweltering, lame, tiring, (insert adjective of your choice), etc.




PS this is just a fun cause and I am not trying to raise money.

1. June is too hot to be stuck in school.

2. A whole week of exam review and another week just for exams is overkill.

3. We never learn anything in June.</description>
