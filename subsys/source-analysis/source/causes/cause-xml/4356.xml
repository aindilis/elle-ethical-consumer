  <description>I am currently in training for the Nike Womens half marathon (21.1km) in San Fran on Oct. 21 2007.  
Along with training for this marathon, all of us on Team In Training are raising funds to help stop leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma and Myeloma from taking more lives. I'm completing this event in honor of all individuals who are battling blood cancers. 

Please visit my website (listed below) for more info and to make a donation to support my participation in Team In Training and help advance the Society's mission
