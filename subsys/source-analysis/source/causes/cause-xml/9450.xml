  <description> Its a group for people, like me, who hate contemporary art. 
Its also the start of a revolution against progressiveness...in the art world.
I suggest we move back to impressionism, or even further, back to the detailed renaissance type portraits of kings and queens.
But seeing as we dont have a monarchy in America.
This group also doubles as a beginning movement towards a monarchy in America!

Down with the establishment, up with...royalty.
 

1. contemporary art gets confusing sometimes, is it just a chair, or is there some symbolic meaning behind it...hmmm...fuck that, wheres a portrait painting.

2. It hurts to look at sometimes.

3. Its confusing?</description>
