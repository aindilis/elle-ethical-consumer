  <description>Bacon comes from pigs. Pigs are furry animals (they have fur, right? hair at least). We should not eat them. How would you like it if they ate you just because you were delicious?

1. Pigs are people too.

2. Bacon is good, but we can live without it.

3. Bacon is pig butt.</description>
