  <description>One of the major point we want to pass on to our community is that bone marrow is RARELY USED once a donor is matched to a patient.  Blood STEM CELLS are collected [just like platelets are collection at the blood bank and the blood is returned to you] and transfered to the patient.

Because of the unique genetic make up of Armenians, it is nearly impossible to find suitable matches among the existing international registries.  When you become a donor through Match For Life, you are participating in an effort to give patients with leukemia and other life-threatening blood diseases a second chance at life.
