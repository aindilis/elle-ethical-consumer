  <description>Operation S.C.O.P.E. was developed by camp counsellors Blake McWilliam, Gary Hunter, and Jason Ellsworth at the end of of the 2007 summer camp session. Looking for a challenge, the boys decided that a cycling tour starting in Halifax, Nova Scotia and ending at Timber Lake Camp in Shandaken, New York would be an amazing adventure. Wanting to give something back to the camping community that gave so much to them, it was agreed that the trip would be a fundraiser for S.C.O.P.E. (Summer Camp Opportunities Provide an Edge).

Leaving the end of May, Gary, Blake and Jason will ride for two weeks and over 900 miles before arriving at their destination. You can follow along by reading the blog&#160;where the boys will keep you updated on their training, planning and even their adventures from the road. Don't forget to leave a comment with a quick hello or some words of encouragement.
