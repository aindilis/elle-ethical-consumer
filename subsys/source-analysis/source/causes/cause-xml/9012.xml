In many distant places, the United States as well, children and adults alike live in agonizing hunger.

THE INCONVIENENT TRUTH:
-Hunger and malnutrition are the #1 risk to global health, killing more people than AIDS, malaria, and TB combined 

-Every 5 seconds a child dies because he or she is hungry 
In 2005 WFP fed 21.7 million children in 74 countries 

-Research shows that free school lunches can increase attendance rates by 100% and boost academic performance

Malnutrition is a severe problem concerning the world.

DID YOU KNOW?

400 million = The number of hungry children in the world. 
50 million = The number of hungry children who are currently not
receiving any form of assistance.


It's time for world hunger to end.

Fortunately, there are numerous ways in which everyone can help. 

1. Lives shouldn't be lived with agonizing hunger.

2. People would kill for our unwanted leftovers.

3. There is so much to do, so let's do it.</description>
