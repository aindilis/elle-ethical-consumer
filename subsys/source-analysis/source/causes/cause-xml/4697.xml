  <description>20 million Americans - 1 in 9 US adults - have Chronic Kidney failre and another 20 million more are at increased risk.  

Early detection can help prevent the progression of kidney disease to kidney failure. 

Heart disease is the major cause of death for all people with CKD. 

High risk groups include those with diabetes, hypertension and family history of kidney disease. 

African Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans and Seniors are at increased risk. 

Three simple tests can detect CKD: blood pressure, urine albumin and serum creatinine. 

Chronic kidney disease includes conditions that damage your kidneys and decrease their ability to keep you healthy by doing the jobs listed. If kidney disease gets worse, wastes can build to high levels in your blood and make you feel sick. You may develop complications like high blood pressure, anemia (low blood count), weak bones, poor nutritional health and nerve damage. Also, kidney disease increases your risk of having heart and blood vessel disease. These problems may happen slowly over a long period of time. Chronic kidney disease may be caused by diabetes, high blood pressure and other disorders. Early detection and treatment can often keep chronic kidney disease from getting worse. When kidney disease progresses, it may eventually lead to kidney failure, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant to maintain life.
