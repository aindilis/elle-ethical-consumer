1. February of 2004 my mother was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.

2. I want to contribute with the most I can to give hope for those who are battling blood cancers and to remember those who have lost their battle.

3. I have set a personal goal to raise at least US$3900 for my Nike Half-Marathon and 75% of every dollar spent at the Society goes to research, patient services and education.</description>
