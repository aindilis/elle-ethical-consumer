  <description>communism may seem like a lovable idea at first, all it is is slavery of innocent people. it must be eliminated throughout the world. if you had a degree and a well paying job, would you like it stripped from you just so that your welfare reliant trailer trash neighbor didnt have to suffer and learn from his mistakes? i think not. DOWN WITH COMMUIST BELEIFS!
