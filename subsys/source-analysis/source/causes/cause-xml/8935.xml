  <description>Please help us stop abortion. Its not right that a child has no choice in his/her life if she wants to live or not. They should live a happy life. The mother shouldn't have to decide if she wants to kill her own child. It will bring her quilt and it will be a scar in her heart, knowing that she could have let her beautiful child live happy. Please help me stop this. Its like a scream for help. I cry for them to live. Help them live and not know that they would have went to heaven so quickly.

1. Stop mothers from killing their own love.

2. Stop the murder

3. Stop them from deciding the fate of their childrens lives</description>
