  <description>The USA is getting its ass handed to itself on a golden platter by countries that are smaller, poorer, and weaker than us on standardized tests. Why is this reality?

Once, the United States was the most intelligent and most creative nation in the world. Now, I highly doubt that the United States makes the top 25 smartest nations in the world. Are we, the children of the United States, any dumber than those who came before us? Obviously not. What's the problem?

Perhaps we should look to our educational system for a problem. And I don't just mean look. I mean LOOK.

What's this cause going to do? Nothing probably. Maybe it will just make people aware of the fact that the United States is not only behind Japan, Korea, France, and China in education, but also New Zealand, Finland, Canada, Sweden, and Austria consistently.

That will show you why you're going to need to at least join this cause.

1. Improve American Education.

2. Make Education more important in politics.

3. Make people understand the importance of education.</description>
