  <description>This is a 6 week summer arts project for college students who seek to grow in following Christ in their art, their words, and their actions.

Through this project, students create collaborative artwork with other students both within the project and within the city based on the results of numerous dialogues using photographic images as prompts for reflection. 

These image dialogues (http://mysoularium.com/) ask people to choose photographs that answer questions such as, " What is your life like right now?", or "Choose an image that best represents what you think spirituality has to offer". 

Through this process, students are able to be catalyst for personal reflection as well as grow in their compassion and ability to listen to others. The artwork is an expression of the entire process. 

During the summer, they are mentored by professional, artsists in NYC who also share faith in Christ. Students also participate in many other activities that encourage them in their understanding of Christ. 

1. Young artists seeking to follow Christ should be encouraged in their art-making. 

2. Art influences culture and also reflects culture. Art has value not only to the individual but to society.

3. Those professing faith in Christ should grow in expressing His values through love in words and actions</description>
