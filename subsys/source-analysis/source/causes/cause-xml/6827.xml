  <description>You know we all have made some bad mistakes in life. Whether it be curiosity, revenge, etc thats triggers us to do it. If you know Matt Adolph you know hes one of those funny cool guys to be with. So honestly if you know matt, you know he can be a true bro. At times hes made you laugh or got you out of trouble at school or he has at least helped some way. He is in need to pay some fees and needs your help to raise money. He is doing everything in his own reach to help himself but he still needs your help! If you could donate any money that would be great! All money is going straight to pay his fees. No scams or loops, he is in need of help badly right now.
