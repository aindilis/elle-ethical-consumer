  <description>Ovarian cancer is known as "The Silent Killer".  My sister, Vicki, passed away Dec 12, 2004.  She was 34 yrs old.  It's too late for her, but if we can help save someone else's life, it will be all worthwhile. Lets not let our Grandmother's, Mother's, Aunt's and Sister's suffering and deaths be in vain.   Please help find a cure!  Thank you.  Sandra
