1. We are the future of our country and we all have a voice!

2. US citizens can vote absentee in federal elections from anywhere in the world &#8211; it is important to inform each other of this right.  

3. Young people who start voting as soon as they are eligible tend to be active electors throughout their lives.

4. Voters who live outside the country often become much more keenly aware of how the US affects the world with its foreign policy and of the importance and value of their right to vote.

5. Voting and assisting others to register to vote and apply for an absentee ballot helps keep citizens connected to the electoral process at home.

6. By setting an example, young voters abroad have the potential to stimulate voter interest and participation at home as well as abroad.</description>
