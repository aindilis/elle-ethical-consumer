  <description>Hello all,
I wish to take rights away from women. You are probably thinking that this is a joke or that i am a sick and disturbed person. Well, i disagree with both; I am neither joking or disturbed enough. 
Do you remember the good old days? The time when women stayed at home all day cooking, cleaning and washing? The time when men were the only people to work and provide money for the food on the table and for that table and the ground it lay on?
If you do not, then let me tell you this. It was a great time. A time which was great.


PS. I am joking. : )
