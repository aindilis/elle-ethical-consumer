  <description>Since causes creation Jennie Hayes, the newest Internal Affairs Coordinator of SGA, has been obscenely obsessed with the application Causes. Before bringing it to her attention she sent over 10 cause invites to nearly 300 people in less than 24 hours. Jennie has already been approached regarding her new found addiction. A group of SGA officials are looking into creating a Cause therapy program so that we can help regulate her obsession with Causes. 

Disclaimer: All of us who were overwhelmed with Causes from Jennie Hayes do feel strongly about many of the issues brought up in the form of causes. We just haven't been able to balance our support for these causes with the new Facebook application. Also, the American Legacy Foundation is in no way affiliated with this cause.

1. Jennie Hayes should decrease the number of cause invites per week.</description>
