  <description>I came to the conclusion at court one day with my ex, after he still wouldn't shut up.  While I was exiting the elevator, I turned and told him, you know, I finally realize you are the reason we have vibrators.  So if any of you women have any vengance you would like to take out, or say about your exe's, well let's do it sisters!!!    
Oh yes, just recently my youngest son was with him for the weekend, my ex waited a whole day for me to pick him up and take him to the emerg., because a BIG piece of steel fell from the roof on his arm, and dickhead never took him to get checked, I did when I picked him up, and now he has a full arm cast on for a month.  So my ex, let him go a whole day with no medical, nothing for pain, all for jacking off knowing him!!!
