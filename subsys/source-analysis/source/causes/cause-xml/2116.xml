  <description>To try and get RCTV back on the air after Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez closed the station because he did not agree with what it said.  Freedom of Expression, dissent, speech, and of the press is under attack and this cause is to make sure that RCTV gets back on air.

If you really want to donate to the cause you can go to http://www.thehrf.org/donate.html.   They are called the Human Rights Foundation and it is a non-profit organization in New York.  Facebook did not allow me to use them because they weren't on the list of non-profit causes so I put Human Rights Watch instead which does similar work around the world not just in the Americas.
