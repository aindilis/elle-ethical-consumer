  <description>Fire gives us heat and energy to run our lives and create everything in our world.  It is the heat in our furnace, the electricity in our computers, and the communication in our cells.  

Humanity has depended heavily on carbon based sources of energy since the begining of time.  These include wood, coal, and oil.  We are intellegent animals, when met with a need to change, we adapt our actions and find new ways to meet our needs.  Now is the time for that to happen.

There are many clean sources of power such as wind turbines, hydro dams, tidal energy and solar energy.  More will be discovered.  The fire of life is everywhere, when we discover how it works in the smallest of places, like in our cells, we can take that and expand it to larger places like our world.  

Many of the worlds battles are fought over energy.  One day we will find a source of energy that is so abundant, totally clean, and so cheep that we can give it away for free.  

Invite the energy of peace into the world by making a donation of $10.  It is an investment in your potential to make the impossible, possible.
