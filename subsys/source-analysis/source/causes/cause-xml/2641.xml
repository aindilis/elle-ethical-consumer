  <description>For years Conrad has been destroying the world. His "roaring" arms and his extremely oversized pecks are his prized items. we must stop him. for mankind, for our freedom, for the lives of our children, he must be stopped. He destroyed King Kong with the wink of an eye. He penetrated our wonderful Statue Of Liberty. He used the Grand Canyon as his toilet ( that took years to drain, lost many lives to that disaster) Worst of all he used The White House as a booger collection jar. I say this once more with more force......HE MUST BE STOPPED!!!
