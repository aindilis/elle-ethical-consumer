  <description>Reggaeton is bad music.  Any1 with a decent I.Q. should b able to tell that every single song has the same basic sound to it, and similar stupid lyrics that simply make no sense to us educated people.  The only way to dance to it is by grinding and dry humping, which, technically, isn't dancing.  Reggaeton is unoriginal, banal, repetitive, low I.Q. music.  All I ask is that people acknowledge it for the crap it is, exploit it, and boycott.  Turn ur radio station when u hear that god forsaking beat that every song has, burn daddy yankee posters, don't buy their horrible abulms.  Juz STOP THE MADNESS!!!
