  <description>The Austin Humane Society is a nonprofit provider of comprehensive humane, life-saving animal services that transform the lives of animals and those who love them. 

Each year, Austin Humane Society touches the lives of more than 8,600 animals in Central Texas through its prevention and adoption initiatives. 

As a no-kill animal shelter, AHS has been working diligently to help Austin move towards the goal of becoming a no-kill city. We work directly with Town Lake Animal Center and other overcrowded shelters to transfer the most vulnerable animals to our shelter where their lives are saved and they find a new home.
