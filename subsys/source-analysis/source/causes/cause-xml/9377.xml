  <description>Welcome to Help Edmonton's Homeless! Our sole mission is to clear up or streets in sections, finding ways to help keep these men, women and children off our streets and out of our building entrances.

I just kicked a guy outta my front entrance who smelt like he pissed himself a few times over. This needs to end these people have dignity too. They obviously don't care much about it... but I care about mine and my city's. 

We accept cash donations. They will be going into helping offer a place of residency for those willing to own up to their misfortunes and begin the journey to help themselves find their dignity. 

After we create this residency, we will accept donations of non-perishable food, clothing, and MANY hygiene products.
