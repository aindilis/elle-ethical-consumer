  <description>Over centuries the world has treked through short and long periods of violence, and the enduring horrors of hatred, ignorance, and loss of meaning. Today, with a war in Iraq and genocides occuring in China and Darfur, we seem completely desensitized to the "death toll" that has become just as normal as the news report or stock market listings. Today, many of us live in our own world- a world that has made us numb and a media that has placated and fooled us. Today, it is more important than ever to accept our HUMAN responsibility; to stand up for the people around us, to choose right over wrong, to recognize malice and stop turning away from lies and corruption. Today, it is your choice to make a difference. 

1. Humans have an inate responsibility to improve the world by stopping violence.

2. Compassion and motivation will make the greatest difference.

3. Human suffering is universal, and it is up to us to mitigate it. </description>
