  <description>The Cape Breton Feline Support Society, referred to as the CBFSS, was formed in April 2005 and is a registered charity. 

The main focus of the CBFSS is to offer care and support to feral or wild undomesticated cats and also strays. Although the CBFSS is independent
of the SPCA, the society works in conjunction with the SPCA on animal welfare matters.

The society has approximately 23 volunteers who are devoted to saving abandoned, stray, and feral cats. They also have a trap, neuter, and release
program also known as TNR, as a means to provide some quality of life, and at the same time humanely manage the numbers of unwanted offspring. Anyone interested in volunteering or offering
assistance, financial or otherwise, can email the
Cape Breton Feline Support Society: cbfss@cbfss.org
