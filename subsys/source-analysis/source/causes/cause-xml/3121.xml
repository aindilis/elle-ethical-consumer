  <description>One country out of Africa...Niger...A country that most people don't know...Where (like in some other parts of the world) some children could have a better life... We are somehow guilty of seeing people that need help, and just do nothing. That is the reason why I ask you to do what you can for those needed people. Join the cause, invite your friends, donate what you can... whatever you do is at least making the world move forward. $10 may not be a lot to offer to some, but those same $10 can actually help a whole family for a couple of days... 
We want you to be aware... We want you to care...
