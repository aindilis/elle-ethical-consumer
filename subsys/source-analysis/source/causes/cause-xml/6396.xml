  <description>Adopt-A-DJ exists because this wonderful earth deserves good music. It needs tuuuuunes. It needs vibes. It needs it now.

Adopt-A-DJ is an independent global campaigning organisation that acts to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the lifestyle standards of DJ's by:

 Ensuring DJ's get fairly paid for their work from promoters that would otherwise wish them hard and try to short change them.

 Defending our DJ's by challenging have-a-go mobile DJ's that come armed with Now That's Music 47.

 Protecting the world&#8217;s best nightclubs from weirdos, Turks, Ashley Cole and goths.

 Working for disarmament and peace by tackling the causes of conflict between North Weezy and every other region on the globe.

1. To find homes for retired and out of work DJ's

2. To ensure record labels keep sending us the latest white labels</description>
