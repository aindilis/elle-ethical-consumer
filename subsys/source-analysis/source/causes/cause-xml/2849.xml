  <description>    In the United States alone, there are over 20,000 registered pugs. They are everywhere, and they need our help. 
    Diego's kids is a charity that seeks to take the first steps to help. Our goal? We hope to make Botox freely available to all pugs. 
    This is only the first step, a real solution will take years. But we offer hope. One injection at a time.

1. Pugs are wrinkly.

2. It's not their fault.

3. You can help.</description>
