  <description>Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder that affects red blood cells. People with sickle cell disease have red blood cells that contain mostly hemoglobin* S, an abnormal type of hemoglobin. Sometimes these red blood cells become sickle-shaped (crescent shaped) and have difficulty passing through small blood vessels. 

 
Normal red blood cell  Sickle-shaped red blood cell 
When sickle-shaped cells block small blood vessels, less blood can reach that part of the body. Tissue that does not receive a normal blood flow eventually becomes damaged. This is what causes the complications of sickle cell disease. There is currently no universal cure for sickle cell disease. 



1. People Should Support Stem Cell Research because this could possibly become a cure for not only Sickle Cell Disease but other illnesses.

2. There should be more Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers across the country, especially in cities that have a high population of people of African descent.</description>
