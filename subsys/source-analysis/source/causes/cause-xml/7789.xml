  <description>According to the 2000 Census, nearly 47 Million citizens spoke another language in their homes.  According to the same report, over 21 Million of the previously mentioned 47 Million spoke English less than "very well."  No person can deny that these numbers are enormous.  This population already has a hard enough time with translation.  This problem WILL become magnified with the passing of an official national language.  We cannot allow the United States to cut off an entire population from being able to communicate, especially when they need to understand and be understood.

1. The United States must not pass English, or any other language as the Official National Language

2. Enhance the quality of alternative forms of communication for non-English speakers.</description>
