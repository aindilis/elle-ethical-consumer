  <description>Simply enough, Everyone plays flipcup, or at least that is to say, everyone that isn't lame.
Given this fact, its also quite interesting to see how many people, if not whole groups at a time, claim themselves to be better than others. Rightfully so at times I can agree are merrited, but more often than not these wildy exagerated boastings really grind peoples gears!
This of course must be stopped, there must in the end be only one true group of people who are to be named victorious, and to have with that victory that special right to look upon the losers and call them.... bitches!

 

1. Flip Cup must be governed! Any sport that involves such high amounts of drinking should be looked after appropriately...ie, no spilling

2. Unfounded claims of excellence in the sport must be stopped, if not deemed reasonable

3. People should have a good time and get drunk sometimes!</description>
  <mission>hold and help run, plus heavily participate in the biggest, if not just larger than average size flip cup tournament! </mission>
