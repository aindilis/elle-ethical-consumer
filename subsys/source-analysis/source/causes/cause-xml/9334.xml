  <description>We are people who have volunteered with orphans in Guatemala. To improve the daily lives of these children we need to keep sending volunteers to the ophanage as well as raise money to run the place. There is always an urgent need for shoes, books, teacher's salaries, rights size clothing...



1. through helping one child you can make a huge difference

2. spread hope, love and warmth in the way that you can by donating money or going to give a hand yourself.

3. look beyind your own needs and wants and remember the this is one world</description>
