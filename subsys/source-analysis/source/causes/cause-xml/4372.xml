  <description>This non-profit organization helps women have a fresh start by giving scholarships by those in need. They do not give scholarships based on color, race, religion, etc. (Women must be at least 20 years old to be applicable for financial help.)

1. Everyone deserves the chance to get a better education. (Although this cause is for an organization that is targeted towards women only.)</description>
