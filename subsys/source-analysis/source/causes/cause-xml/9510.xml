  <description>Caitlin Marie Tretter, my cousin, was born on friday, April 16th of 1993.  She has spent everyday of her life fighting to live since being diagnosed at the age of 3 with a malignant brain tumor.  Even though this adorable young girl had death on her shoulders, all she could do was smile. She always lived life to its fullest and didnt let her cancer get in the way of being happy. On April 16, 1999, Caitlin was in such bad shape that they decided to take her off of life support. The morning of her 6th birthday she was taken away from what was keeping her alive. God bless her soul, she passed away the following morning, living out her 6th birthday.  We honor her life by running an annual charity in her name and for her cause. This was the 7th year running and over $170,000 has been raised mostly in my uncles backyard. At this fundraiser we auction and raffle off hundreds of items such as bigscreen LCD tv's, Iphone's, and signed sports and entertainment memorabilia. We donate all the money earned towards Chicago Comer Children's Hospital, Children's Memorial Hospital, and Lutheran General Hospital. Please help this cause!
