  <description>We have worked with various orphanages all over India and have started an orphanage in South India. There are many ways to help these kids. We take several trips a year to provide assistance and encouragement to the orphans and staff workers. Prayerfully consider going or supporting the orphans from here. Give by going, go by giving.
