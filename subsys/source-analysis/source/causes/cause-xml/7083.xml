  <description>Ronald McDoanld is polluting the minds of innocent young children the world over. Children recognise him before they recognise who their president is. This has to stop. With your help, we can train gentetically enhanced, rabid poodles with one goal in mind, to end the life of this ridiculous demi-god like figure who has been preverting the minds of children (and in some cases adults) all over the world. He has been taunting society with his unsavoury, unhealthy and down right poisonous food for the last thirty years. He must be stopped at all costs.
