  <description>Everyone should know the warning signs of a stroke. Every minute is essential to the recovery of the patient. Anyone can have a stroke. There is no age bracket. Recovery is possible in some cases, especially with rehabilitation, therapy and family support.

Act F.A.S.T!

F- Face - Ask the person to smile. Does one side of their face droop?

A- Arms - Ask the person to lift their arms. Does one arm drift downwards?

S- Speech - Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence.
Are the words slurred?  Can he/she repeat the sentence correctly?

T- Time - If the person shows any of these symptoms, time is important. Call 911 or get to the hospital fast. Brain cells are dying.
