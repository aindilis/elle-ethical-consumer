  <description>Since 1998, the University of South Carolina's Dance Marathon has been raising money for the Palmetto Health Children's Hospital. To date, USC students have raised over 400,000 dollars for the hospital, with this past year raising a record break 102,000 dollars. This year marks an important year for Palmetto Health, as the new Children's Hospital will be completed. Children from all over the state of South Carolina will be able to receive the best care possible in a hospital designed totally for their needs. Dance Marathon is proud to be an annual contributor to this cause. Help us help those who aren't able to help themselves.

1. Every child and their family deserves the best healthcare they can get.</description>
