  <description>&#8220;Imagine all the people living life in peace.&#8221;-John Lennon
This was once the motto of a generation. A generation that was not afraid to stand up and scream at the top of their lungs whatever they wanted. I hate to say it, but this generation has shown nothing but fear when dealing with what needs to be done. We continue to rely on the previous generation and hope they will pull through for us. Well guess what; thats not going to last forever. We elect these officials to seats of power for them to do whatever they please. The definition of a democracy is government for the people by the people. Its time we stand up and take our government back.

1. Educate the youth of this country and show them what is really going on.

2. Stand up and voice our beliefs.

3. Make a difference and make our voices heard to the people who have been elected on our behalf.</description>
