  <description>This cause is an unofficial forum for the Harvard College Fund.  The fund is a vehicle for giving back to a university to which many of us feel quite indebted.   Among many other things, the fund allows you to target your support in areas which may be of particular interest including:

Undergraduate Life Fund
Faculty Support
Financial Aid/Scholarships
Grad Fellowships
Libraries
Unrestricted Funds

A note on donating should you feel compelled:

You can donate Harvard directly through &#8220;causes&#8221; (but this cannot currently be targeted for your class participation)

Or, to make a donation online, you can follow this link (make sure to fill out the section including your class):
