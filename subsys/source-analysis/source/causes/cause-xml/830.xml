  <description>FOR LEGAL REASONS PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE DESCRIPTION

In September I saw a seemingly great mobile phone deal at phones4u. For an effectual &#163;10 a month (via claim forms) for the first 12 months on an 18th month contract I would get 800 cross network minutes and 500 cross network texts a month. I categorically asked if it was for the entire duration of the contract, the salesman said yes.

So when I opened up my recent bill showed 400 minutes and 250 texts there was a bit of suprise.

Being me I promptly went down to the store asking to speak to the manager. Instead they put me on to head office via a phone informing me that was not the contract I signed. Politely informing them it doesn't matter, it's bad customer service to LIE to consumers, I promised if they didn't give me what I was informed was part of the contract I would post it up on Facebook. So here we are. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your workmates to not shop at Phones4U as they allow loyal customers to be deceived by their staff 

1. Phones 4 U should honour their agreements even as a result of wayward salespeople

2. Complaints should be made face to face not over a phoneline

3. Customer Service is more important than legal technicalities</description>
