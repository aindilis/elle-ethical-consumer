  <description>For too long humans have lived without a being higher up on the food chain.  Therefore I feel it is time we kill all humans and let another creature of this planet have a turn at running things, my vote is for the manatee.

1. Humans are destroying the planet they must be stopped

2. Humans breed like rabbits and must be killed

3. Humans do not shut up about how great they think they are</description>
