  <description>The vision of Sigma-Omicron Chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity is to be the pinnacle of campus life socially, academically, and athletically. The men of TKE will strive to be the top fraternity both locally and internationally.

We will be known as leaders on campus and in the community. We will be known as a fraternity that achieves social, academic, and athletic excellence, while still providing service to our campus and community. TKE will be known as the standard for all other fraternities.

Each brother will put forth as much time and effort as possible to make TKE the best fraternity it can be. Brothers will treat everyone with the respect they deserve and will make individual sacrifices for the good of the whole chapter.

Our chapter will be a fraternity that exemplifies the ideals set forth in our Declaration of Principles with fraters who strive to live by them daily. Sigma-Omicron will show people what a fraternity is meant to be.

Right now our Chapter is trying to raise funds to purchase a permanent Chapter home.  Your support is appreciated!  For full details, please visit: www.buythetkehouse.com
