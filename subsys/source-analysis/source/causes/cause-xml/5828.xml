  <description>This is for all those who believe that abortion is wrong. (except in certain circumstances)

This group was created to discuss abolishing abortions, not to discuss if we should allow them or not. The right to an innocent being's life is at stake every day and will coninue to be if us bystanders don't start to stand up and provent it. 

Children are the future, but if we continue to allow them to be murdered before they get the chance to make a difference, what good comes of that? 

This group was created for people to stand up and make a stance to save lives. Nobody is expected to join this cause, especially if you do not see a problem at all with abortions, but if you truely do care, than state your concerns, beliefs, opinions or anything else....but do it because you care about our future!

1. Abortion is murder.

2. Children are our future, so protect them</description>
