  <description>Domestic violence is a issue taken to lightly by most officials. This isn't to bad-mouth or demean any organizations in any way but to show them that people suffer regardless of the "immediate danger" or "escalating violence." People who are affected by this cannot look at others and say, "well it can be worse". All situations are different in intensity and extremities but it's still wrong. It doesn't make it any less important.

1. Zero tolerance for domestic violence.

2. Assist people in finding help.</description>
