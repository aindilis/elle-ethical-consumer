  <description>The Side-Out Foundation (Side-Out) was established to raise money and awareness about Cancer through the recreational activity of volleyball. Our name underscores the purpose of our organization &#8211; &#8220;side-out&#8221; in volleyball occurs when one team wins a point while its opponent is serving, thereby regaining serve or control of play. Likewise in the war against Cancer, Side-Out will support health care professionals and researchers help women and men with Cancer maintain / regain control of their own lives through improved awareness, education, detection, treatment, and cure, thereby enabling them to live life to the fullest.

1. We are trying raise money through volleyball related activities like tournaments, clinics, and rallies.

2. We want to make it so that every dollar that people donate to the foundation goes directly toward research and finding a cure.</description>
