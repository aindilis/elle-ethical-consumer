  <description>What exactly is a chinchilla? A chinchilla is a rodent from the family of Chinchillidae. Their fur is one of the most softest on earth with over 50 times softer than human hair and with 50 000 hairs in one folicle alone.

Chinchillas are highly prized for their fur for its softness, colour and unique patterns, as a result thousands of these small little creatures are slaughtered each day for the use of fur coats. Most farmers kill their chins by ways of electrocution some don't even use the standard voltage as a result either not kill the creature or leave it partially stunned still vulnerable to the pain of being skinned.

Considering chinchillas are becoming popular pets it is shocking to see there is no action to stop the fur farming of these poor creatures.

A PETA page on chinchilla cruelty includes a video on it: http://www.peta.org/feat/chinchilla/index.html

1. To stop the fur farming of chinchillas

2. To end cruelty to chinchillas

3. establish more animal rights for these creatures</description>
