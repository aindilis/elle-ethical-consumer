  <description>Platini, as head of UEFA, has decided to chime in on a few Italian soccer related issues, most notably the issue regarding Francesco Totti's status on the national team.  As the leader of a powerful organization like UEFA, Platini's influence in matters not pertaining to his jurisdiction should be minimized.  Showing childishness by telling Francesco Totti to 'shut up' does not display the kind of leadership that is necessary to run an organization like UEFA.

Apart from his declaration that female soccer players should wear tighter shorts, Sepp Blatter has consistently displayed a poor leadership ability.  Having been involved in various corruption scandals, Blatter's reign as FIFA chair has been marred by controversy.  His most important blunder was that he failed to award the Azzurri with the 2006 World Cup on July 9th 2006.  He also stated that Australia 'should' have beaten Italy, and therefore Italy did not deserve to be champions.  

As football fans, it's about time that we stand up for what is just and remove these two pieces of shit from their posts.

1. Sepp Blatter must be removed immediately

2. Michel Platini must be removed immediately

3. Both FIFA and UEFA must recognize Italia as the greatest footballing nation in the history of Europe.</description>
