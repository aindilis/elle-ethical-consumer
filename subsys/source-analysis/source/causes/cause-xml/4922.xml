  <description>To promote awareness of the persecution of Bahais in Iran, and the systematic steps the Iranian government is taking to erradicate the Bahais.
The Bahai faith originates in Iran, yet the Iranian government refuses to recognize the Bahai faith as a religion. For over a century Bahais have been imprisioned, executed, and denied higher education because of their beliefs. Recently youth and kids as young as 12 have been expelled and denied education for no reason other than the fact that they are Bahais.
This group was made so that people can understand what is happening to the Bahais and take action to end it. By writing to your congressman or representative, or writing to the UN we can raise the awareness of the Bahais persecution around the world.

1. The Bahais are being unjustly persecuted

2. While the UN has recognized the plight of the Bahais in Iran, and action has been taken (even though small) little has changed in Iran</description>
