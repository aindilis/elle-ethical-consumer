  <description>Mic is currently doing merch for Newton, KS' black metallers Antemortem. He has a full time job but his new car is sucking up all the money he needs to buy the kit. The set is in the $600s. If you help him to raise at least half of that money he will be more than grateful! Remember: Every Dollar Counts.

1. Mic is a musician already

2. Mic loves playing guitar and bass, but its the drums he truly desires musically.

3. Mic is poor and needs his friends' help!</description>
