  <description>Inspired by the love and generosity of our supporters, we strive to give a voice to all children with optic nerve hypoplasia and hydrocephalus. We will educate and inform others about these disorders. We will support research efforts to benefit children with optic nerve hypoplasia and hydrocephalus. Our mission will be accomplished with the highest level of integrity and commitment.

This year we are running the 2007 Chicago Marathon on October 7th, 2007. We are running for a little boy named Zach.  Zach's parents have started the One Small Voice Foundation.  The One Small Voice is a wonderful organization that we have decided to raise money for.  

On October 7th, 2007 we will be running 26.2 miles through out the great city of Chicago in Zach's honor.  Zach fights every day of his life and has endured so much in his few years, for one day we will give everything we have for Zach.   

Any donation you would like to give would be greatly appreciated by all of us and the One Small Voice Foundation.
