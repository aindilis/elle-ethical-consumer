  <description>The vision of the Salesforce.com Foundation is to use salesforce.com&#8217;s people, technology and relationships to improve our communities, inspire youth to be more successful, support the world during times of extreme need, and promote compassionate capitalism.

Salesforce.com Foundation is currently matching donations up to $50,000 to American Red Cross in their relief and rebuilding efforts in Japan.  The American Red Cross helps countless individuals affected by disasters both in the U.S. and internationally and we are eager to double your contribution to support their important work.

In addition, through the generosity of a $50,000 gift from the Miner Foundation, we have been able to double the matching pool once again, and match donations up to $100,000 resulting in an additional $200,000. The Miner Foundation (www.minerfoundation.org) is a US IRS 501c (3) tax-exempt charitable foundation established by Allen Miner, Founder and CEO of SunBridge Corporation (www.sunbridge.com)

Salesforce.com Foundation is announcing an extension of their matching program for victims of Japan and will direct $25,000 in matching funds to the Japan Cultural Center: http://apps.facebook.com/causes/590211
