  <description>Have you ever seen trash lying on the ground? it may not be a lot, or maybe it is a whole load of shit lying all over the place (where it shouldn't be). Either way, there is no reason for people to leave their trash lying around anywhere. It belongs in a fucking trash can. So if you are joining this cause you are to not litter and if you are to see any trash lying around.. please pick it up. I work for the YMCA and i got my whole class of kids to pick up all of the filthy garbage lying around on their playground with a reward of pizza. However, i do not believe one really needs a reward to save their own environment. So please help me keep this world become a cleaner place.
