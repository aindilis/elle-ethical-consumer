My friend will be running a  26.2 mile marathon  in Florence this November. She is taking part in a six-month training program and  is running a little farther each week...BUT SHE NEEDS YOUR HELP!!!!

As part of  the National AIDS Marathon Training Program, which raises money for the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. She has committed to raise at least $3,900 by mid August. The money raised from the AIDS Marathon Training Program will fund direct medical care, food, housing, and other vital AIDS services &#8212; to help keep people with HIV/AIDS alive until there&#8217;s a cure. 

Although of course she would like to raise lots more, she needs your help to make that dream a reality. 

Track Kim's progress below, and tell your friends that a small bit can go a long way.
