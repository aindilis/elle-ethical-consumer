1. Frustrate: Something's wrong with your church. Something's wrong with the Church. Church marketing efforts and communication in general suck.

2. Educate: We love the church, but it needs some help. We've got the greatest story in the world, but we don't know how to tell it. 

3. Motivate: This isn't simply about putting butts in pews or selling glossy postcards. It's about helping the church be the Church.</description>
