  <description>Violence against woman and children has reached an all time high in South Africa and still the goverment chooses to ignore the cries for help. 

Children as young as 9 months are being raped to cure AIDS/HIV. Woman around South Africa are being ganged raped, drugged in nightclubs then raped and these are just 2 of the millions of stories we are faced with everyday.

The worst part of it all - rapists are given bail of R500 rand!!!! Your expired TV license R1000 fine!!!!

Violence against woman and children needs to stop!!!


1. The voice of Woman and Children needs to be heard!!!
