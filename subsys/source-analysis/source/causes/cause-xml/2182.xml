  <description>With the help of the community, Urban Peak works to provide safety, engagement, and empowerment for homeless youth ages 14 to 24 in Denver and Colorado Springs.  Our Shelter, Housing, and Drop-In programs are safe, supportive communities that where young people can stay while they put their lives back together after the trauma of the street.  Through the Education and Employment department and Life Skills Training programs, youth are empowered to unlock their full potential to become responsible, self-sufficient adults.

1. Every person has the ability to be self-reliant and contribute to a community.

2. Every person deserves respect.</description>
