  <description>While most of our country is "left-wing," we end up governed by a right-wing nut!

This is happening because the left vote is split between several parties, while the right is not.

If we combined all the left-leaning votes (from Liberal, NDP, Green, and Marxist) we would easily have a majority government.

HARPER AND THE CONSERVATIVES DON'T REPRESENT OUR POPULATION!!! GET THEM OUT!!!

1. Canadian citizens must be given a fair opportunity to vote out Harper and the conservatives.

2. While the majority of Canada is left-leaning, our left votes don't really "count" for what they are worth because they're split between many parties.</description>
