  <description>Students4Seniors is a volunteer organization established and operated by students, and supervised by a parent board. Since more and more people are living longer and want to continue to live in their own homes, we help out seniors in "little" ways. 

We will...
-provide books, videos, and music 
-teach you how to use a computer and the internet
-send cards and notes
-run errands such as grocery shopping or returning library books
-play cards and board games
-walk the dog
-provide companionship 

Students attend a wide variety of Bay Area high-schools and provide their services for free! The students are bright, enthusiastic, trustworthy, and committed to helping seniors. Our program, Students4Seniors, is administered through an already established non-profit organization, Senior Affordable Housing of the West, Inc. (SAHOW). SAHOW was formed as a 501 (c) 3 with a mandate to provide affordable housing for seniors.
