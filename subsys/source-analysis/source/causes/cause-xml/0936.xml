Lobsters are pretty much adorable, and it is cruel and unnecessary to keep live ones in tanks with rubberbands around their claws.  A lobster is a living creature just like a dog or cat, and just because they aren't as easy to identify with as cats and dogs doesn't mean they don't have the right to a happy painfree life.  Also, lobsters shouldn't be boiled alive.  They deserve a quick and painless death, just like their human counterparts. 

1. Lobsters shouldn't be kept in tanks while they are still alive.

2. Lobsters should not be boiled alive.

3. Lobsters should be able to roam free in the ocean and live happy lives.

4. Lobsters are adorable and cuddly.</description>
