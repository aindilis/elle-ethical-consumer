  <description>GLOBAL YOUTH FUND is the world's first democratic charity.

Created by youth for youth, it engages young people around the world in a democratic bottom-up process to choose their own global campaigns.

Members then organize activities in their communities to create awareness and raise funds for their chosen campaigns.

Global Youth Fund is a registered charity in Canada and a project sponsored by the Creative Visions Foundation 501(c)3 in the U.S.

Its current programs include:

1) Ideas Bank - an online database of the best solutions for our planet, the best ideas for change.

2) This I Believe Essay Project - Youth share with one another life-changing moments that helped define or shape a core belief they have.
