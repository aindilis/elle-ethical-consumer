  <description>Mercy Ministries is a non-profit organization for young women who face life-controlling issues. We provide residential programs free of charge designed to address the whole person: spiritual, physical and emotional. Our non-conventional approach to the underlying issues changes more than behavior; the Mercy Ministries program changes hearts and stops destructive cycles.
Our program includes life-skills training and educational opportunities that help ensure the success of our graduates. Our goal is to have each young woman not only complete the program but also discover the purpose for her life and bring value to her community as a productive citizen.

We have three facilities in the United States: Nashville, TN has 40 beds, Monroe, LA has 20 beds and St. Louis, Missouri has 30 beds. Plans are underway for a 40 bed home in Sacramento, California.
