  <description>NKF funds research fellowships and awards grants for research on kidney and urinary diseases. NKF also distributes educational brochures, organ donor cards and newsletters to the public. The National Kidney Foundation conducts the Kidney Early Evaluation Program (KEEP), a series of nationwide free health screenings for those at risk for kidney disease --people with diabetes, high blood pressure or a family history of kidney disease. KEEP is helping those at risk find out about their chronic kidney disease while prevention and early intervention is still possible. The program screens 1,000 people each month and last year, the number of people screened through KEEP topped 65,000.

The U.S. Transplant Games is an Olympic-style event for those with life-saving organ transplants of every type --kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas and bone marrow. More than 1,500 transplant athletes from all over the U.S. compete in 13 sports in the biennial event, showcasing the success of transplantation and encouraging organ donation.
