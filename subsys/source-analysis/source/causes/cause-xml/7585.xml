 Impaired driving is the #1 cause of criminal death in Canada and, yet, every impaired driving crash is preventable. By calling 911 and reporting suspected impaired drivers to police, all Canadians can play a role in keeping our roads safe and in reducing impaired driving crashes, deaths and injuries.

On average just under 4 Canadians are killed every day and just under 190 Canadians are injured each day.

Approximately 70,000 Canadians are impacted by impaired drivers annually.
