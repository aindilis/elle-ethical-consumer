  <description>What good comes from war? Death? Destruction? We have but one life to live, why should we live it in fear? Why should other people have to live this way? The answer is that they shouldn't have to. No one should have to grow up in the hell that war creates and the hopelessness it leaves in it's aftermath. Nothing is worth the taking of a human life.

The End All War cause understands that not all wars are inevitable. But we live in a day and age where commuication is instant and simple. The governments of the world are using wars far too liberally and abandoning diplomatic solutions at the drop of a hat to instead roll out the tanks. This should not be this way.

This is the information age. Let us start using information for good instead of evil. Talk, don't kill.

1. Promote the use of diplomatic relations.

2. Decrease spending on weapons and increase spending in human rights on a global scale.

3. Make the world less bloody, and give all human beings a chance at a life of peace.</description>
