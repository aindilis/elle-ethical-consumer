  <description>Hey folks, as you probably do not know but a person very close to me has MS for quite a while. It is a very sad thing to see when this person struggles to do things that you and I take for granted like walking to the mailbox to get the mail, to drive a car without becoming exhausted. I cannot tell you how much this hurts to see. I believe that the cure is near. I do not know if it will make a difference right away but eventually I believe they will find a cure. It would mean so much if you would join his cause and help me stad up for those with MS and to try to raise money to find a cure for this horrible life-taking disease.

1. To open the eyes if everyone to this disease

2. To fight to find a cure to this disease

3. To help those who have been diagnosed with this disease</description>
