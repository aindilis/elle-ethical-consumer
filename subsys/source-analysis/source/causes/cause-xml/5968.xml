  <description>Animal Crulety is carried as a felony in all states and comes with jail time and removal of the pets.  But it is still going on-many pets each day are beaten, starved, and abused.  
It could be the dog or cat that you own now or any pet that could have gone to a diffrent home and abused to death or near death and when removed the pet would no longer trust people and become hostile for in many of the cases the pets reomoved have such an agrivated attitude becuase of the pain caused by them they are put to sleep or they are so far abused nothing can help them and it is the most humane thing to do...
