  <description>Human relationships are absolutely essential to mankind, yet mankind has largely failed to respect the power contained in simply recognizing another person as such.  We advocate peace.  We advocate a recognition that to seek to destroy another only fosters further violence.  The only true path to peace is a fundamental shift in mindset, and the effort to better ourselves for the sake of the world.

1. War, even justified, is universally destructive.

2. Diplomacy and respect for life can and will generate a peaceful world

3. Peace is not only economically viable, but economically beneficial.

4. International relations must be conducted with an attempt to see the world like those sitting across the table from ones self.</description>
