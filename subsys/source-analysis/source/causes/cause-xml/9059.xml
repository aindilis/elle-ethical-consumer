  <description>Maybe the children out grew them, Maybe they can't keep up with a busy show schedual or 3 hour trail rides. After years of dedication and love, many horses and ponies are left and forgotten to sit in a field without proper care and love, or end up in auctions where they are bought for meat as their appearance shy's anyone away for a second chance. I find these animals and rehabilitate them and find loving homes where they will used by children and families who are looking for dedicated and safe mounts.These horses and ponies thrive off of their new found hope and love and end up to be diamonds in the rough.Any help to my Veternarians , where I always have a bill or my feed store greatly appreciated!! Or you can sponser one of these lovely animals and come spend some time and show them the love they so desperately need. I do not however beleive in keeping animals that will spend any of their life in pain or misery  just to have people feel sorry for them.Despite being under weight or some slight unsound issue all  of these horses and ponies can live a happy pain free functonal life in the future. Thank you so much Lainie and Family and Our Horses and Ponies.
