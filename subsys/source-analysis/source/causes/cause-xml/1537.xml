  <description>Since 2000, the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM) has been the meeting place and united voice of the dynamic grassroots movement advocating for comprehensive immigration reform and the civil rights of immigrants in America.

FIRM is a project of the Center for Community Change, a national organization dedicated to improving the lives of low-income people and people of color.  FIRM is led by its member organizations and brings leaders together across lines of race, issues and geography to multiply their power.

The hundreds of organizations involved in FIRM come from every state in the nation and have deep roots in their local communities. 

FIRM is deeply committed to long-term social change.  Every day, FIRM organizations feel the crushing impact that America&#8217;s broken immigration system has on immigrant families.  And every day, FIRM leaders personify and project the uplifting spirit of hope found in immigrant communities from New York to Kansas City to Los Angeles.
