  <description>Team In Training&#174; (TNT) is the world's largest endurance sports training program, allowing each athlete to run, walk or ride in honor of a patient with leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma. 

I am training to participate in the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon on October 7, 2007.  Please help me raise $5,000 to benefit blood cancer surviors.

Please visit my TNT sponsored webpage and donate to support The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.
