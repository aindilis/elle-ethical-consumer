  <description>On Jan 2-6, 2008, the Party for the Presidency will bring together one young activist from every Congressional District in the nation.  These 435 top activists of our generation will congregate in New Hampshire to learn from each other, receiving recognition and support for their work, and ensure that our issues are at the forefront of the Presidential debate throughout 2008.

1. Young people are the greatest resource of our nation

2. Young people have the ability to determine the 2008 election

3. Beyond the Presidential Candidates, our generation can organize to support local and state candidates who prioritize our issues</description>
