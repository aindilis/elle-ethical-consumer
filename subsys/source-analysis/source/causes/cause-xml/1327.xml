help save global warming today by doing nothing, keep driving 4X4's, leaving the tv on, and wasting as much plastic as possible.

1. endanger as many creatures as possible, no one likes competition.

2. ban recycling, recyclings for loosers.

3. drive the biggest monster truck you can find, people will respect you for it.</description>
