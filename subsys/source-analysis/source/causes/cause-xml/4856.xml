Kids on a BenchReading Is Fundamental, Inc. prepares and motivates children to read by delivering free books and literacy resources to those children and families who need them most.

Founded in 1966, RIF is the oldest and largest children's and family nonprofit literacy organization in the United States. RIF&#8217;s highest priority is reaching underserved children from birth to age 8. Through community volunteers in every state and U.S. territory, RIF provides 4.5 million children with 16 million new, free books and literacy resources each year. 

All RIF programs combine three essential elements to foster children's literacy: reading motivation, family and community involvement, and the excitement of choosing free books to keep.

RIF's accomplishments are due in part to the generous support of the U.S. Department of Education, corporations, foundations, community organizations, and thousands of individuals. 

1. Ensure that every child believes in the value of books and the importance of reading.

2. Assist children and their families with the fundamental resources children need to become motivated to read.

3. Lead in the creation and development of national, regional and local collaborations building strong community-based children&#8217;s and family literacy programs. </description>
