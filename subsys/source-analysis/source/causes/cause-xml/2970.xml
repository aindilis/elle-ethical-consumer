  <description>Abortion. 40 Million lives taken since 1973. Possibly a reason for a generation's job shortages. Many people fail to realize that a child living inside the mother is an individual. While not able to make choices for themselves, these children have the same rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as we have. How can YOU help?

As the 2008 election comes upon us, it is time for pro-life, people who wish to stand behind a cause for the ethical treatment of unborn children, to rise up and take a stand. Push for changes. Know what the candidate you are voting for stands for. It is time to make a change, an amendment if you will. We can stop the American Holocaust. We can put an end to this atrocity. Abortion, otherwise known as murder, must be halted. You can help. Join in, join the cause, take a stand for those who will never be given the chance to stand.

1. Abortion is murder and should be amended and outlawed.

2. Unborn children are separate entities from their mother, with his/her own heartbeat and DNA. 

3. Unborn children have the same right to life that we have, no matter the age or circumstances of the mother's pregnancy. Life is life, and abortion is murder.</description>
