  <description>Positive Foundations at Brandeis University is the premier student-led organization mobilizing universities around the UN Millennium Development Goals to eradicate extreme poverty by 2015. 

We are currently working with Professor Jeffrey D. Sachs, Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, Special Advisor to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the ONE Campaign. 

Our two main goals are:

1. To become the first student-led group at a single university to sponsor and partner with a Millennium Village in sub-Saharan Africa. (www.earth.columbia.edu/millenniumvillages). 
Help us reach this goal by donating now!

2. To create and maintaing a National Student Network on the MDGs, by mobilizing universities around the country and declaring them Millennium Campuses.
