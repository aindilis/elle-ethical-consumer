  <description>On May 16th 2007 Sean Kennedy was punched in the face by a self confessed "Skin Head" and later died from his wounds. Why is it that a kid who is 18 can get killed for being gay, and all I see on the news is Paris Hilton's new shoes, or about kids smoking pot. Sean and many other gay's and lesbians have been killed and nobody is saying anything about it in the media. For those of you who are my friends and those who arent. I ask that we bring light to this situation. I believe that by getting the word out we can bring light to the lack of justice to many people have recieved when it comes to hate in America
Please join this cause showing that you have read this and that you agree that Sean and others like him should have been at the top of the media, and that this subject needs to brought to the attention of every human being in the world

Sean Kennedy said it best in a poem entitled &#8220;Grin&#8221; he wrote that his mother discovered after his death, 

&#8220;I stand tall with all of my pride. You hate. You discriminate all who are not like you. 

Yes, your words do hurt.

But I stand in the end.

I&#8217;m a strong person, bigger than you&#8230;I&#8217;ll be standing there with a grin.&#8221;


1. To bring light to hate in the world

2. To fight for the rights for all humans

3. To bring love to everyone, not just those who are considered "Normal"</description>
