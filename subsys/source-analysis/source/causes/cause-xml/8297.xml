  <description>Photo Radar does not solve any problem.  Speed is not what kills, its the stupid driving habits and lack of ability to drive at higher speeds that kill.  If speeding was what killed, why are vehicles even allowed to over 100 KM/hr.  The technology exists to limit the vehicle's speed.  Why aren't vehicles made to withstand the impact of accidents at speeds the vehicles are capable of reaching.  It NASCAR drivers can hit a wall at over 200 MPH, and the driver walks away,  why can't normal vehicles offer protection that comes closer to that.  Photo Radar is just a means for governments to generate more revenue, not the solution to safer driving.
