  <description>This is a group set out to right the wrong we have believed since children. Dinosaurs aren't real and I don't believe in them. Everyone knows the Man invented Dinosaurs as a means to keep the black man out of the rural areas and instead in the over populated cities in the 1940's. It's another way of oppressing us all as a whole-- so the Man can have us to believe in something that doesn&#8217;t exist. No one ever finds a Bone in the US, and Fossils are not bones -they are rocks in the shape of bones and somehow these Scientist go over in the desert with a Make up brush and start brushing and supposedly find a bone... I give you all a challenge, go outside with a shovel and find one dinosaur bone, just one, you won't because they don't exist. All they do is have you too believe that one chip of a bone of a cow is some how the jaw of a T-rex, they say there are over 400 species of dinosaurs... that deserves a big...." COME ON"... so open the eyes of the people around you... just really think about it&#8230;&#8230;of course these guys are going to carve out rocks to look like bones. Wouldn&#8217;t you if all you had to do for a job was travel and play in the dirt occasionally? These people have a stake in making you believe.... Open the eyes!

1. Dinosaurs are a Farce

2. The earth is only 6,000 and change years old

3. People digging with make up brushes can carve anything out of rock</description>
