  <description>This is an organization that I'm putting into full swing this summer.  I'm almost finished with the website, which will have a link to Save A Life teachers (with designs I drew) and the money will all go to veterinary hospitals, local (California) animal shelters, reservations, and other independant care facilities.  I'll have a secified list of these soon.

1. Animals deserve better treatment

2. Too many species are becoming endangered

3. Animals are losing their habitats</description>
