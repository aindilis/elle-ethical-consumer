  <description>In Nicaragua, there are girls as young as 10, 12 years old who are pregnant. A great deal of these pregnancies result from rape...either by a stranger or by the girls' own family members.

21% of all newborn children have adolescents as their mothers (Proyecto Dos Generaciones 1996), partly due to near inexistant sexual education.

The purpose of the Nicaraguan Women &amp; Children's Fund is to help educate these young girls on how to care for themselves while pregnant and how to care for the babies after they are born.

The women &amp; children are educated about personal hygeine and helped to create maternity clothing to be worn during the pregnancies, baby clothes, socks, baby blankets, carriers, etc.

Please donate what you can--you will be surprised what $10 can do for these families.

1. We must help educate these women &amp; children.</description>
