  <description>I can no longer sit idly by while these two Border Patrol agents sit in prison. Here's the situation:
"Border Patrol agents Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos sit in jail for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler...... they were in the process of attempting to apprehend an illegal drug smuggler &#8212; and I believe he had, what, 800 pounds of marijuana with him. He fled across the border. The agents had claimed, in fact, that he had pointed a gun at them, and that's the only reason that they fired" - http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,249478,00.html
They're now being accused of covering up the shooting and the prosecutor has added a weapons charge as well. The statue under which they charged these agents is supposed to be used against felons using weapons in the comission of a crime, not against federal officers in the course of their duties.

The fact is that more and more criminals are getting the benefit of the doubt, and are getting better treatment than citizens in this country.
Did you know that if you shoot someone who is trying to attack you, they (or their family) can turn around and sue you? I can't be the only one to think this is absurd. Help me fix this

1. Fix the system so that these scumbags don't get 5 star treatment

2. Pardon the two agents</description>
