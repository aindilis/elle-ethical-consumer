  <description>We envision a world where all children are given a healthy start to life. This is a world where all children are given access to medical services, provided with basic education and guaranteed their fundamental human rights. It is a world where a basic respect for our children ensures that they will not be deprived of their innocence as a result of war, internal conflict, disease, discrimination, debt, trade policies, lack of resources or politics that perpetuate injustice. Direct attention to children&#8217;s issues would be a priority but so too would be connecting child survival to other global justice issues such as empowering women, improving access to basic sanitation services and creating political stability. Achieving this vision will require a renewed focus on our common humanity. It will mean struggling against political and societal norms that perpetuate apathy, indifference and a sense of powerlessness. Geography and economics cannot be used as excuses; we must acknowledge our responsibilities to our increasingly global community. We cannot allow thousands of children to die each and every day when we have the knowledge and resources to prevent those deaths.

1. Children's rights to heath and education should not be determined by the geography of their birth.

2. Rich governments have a responsibility to fund initiatives to reduce child mortality

3. Children, often the least protected members of societies, deserve special attention in the provision of foreign aid</description>
