  <description>"The best thing one can do when it's raining is to let it rain." -Henry Wadsworth Longfellow



Kissing in the rain
Singing in the rain
Dancing in the rain
Running in the rain
Driving in the rain
Swimming in the rain
Walking in the rain

...we must embrace the fact that EVERYTHING is simply more majestic in the rain. Everything.


Rain has the extradordinary power to either make us forget our fears or hide our tears when we can't force our worries to the back of our mind.
Rain makes us feel small (thunderstorms in particular.) It puts everything back into perspective.
Rain is cleansing.
Rain is beauty.
