  <description>Electric Vehicles or EV's are few and far between in Africa. 

The closest offering on the market here in South Africa is a hybrid petrol/electric vehicle. Namely the Toyota Prius. The cost of this vehicle is nearly that of a new Mercedes Benz putting it out of reach of a large percentage of the population. 

There is a stigma attached to electric cars that makes them not look appealing. They are perceived as being slow and under powered. The truth is that all of that has  changed.  Currently there is an electric sports car called the Tesla Roadster that is showing that electric cars can be even better than some normal sports cars. http://www.teslamotors.com/index.php

Another promising EV is the Zap X. http://www.zapworld.com/

These are high performance examples, what is needed is something that can be used for the daily commute.

There is a solution... convert existing vehicles to EV's.



Perhaps the only stigma that we need to get rid of is the sound of an engine.



1. An affordable electric vehicle is needed on the market

2. More hybrids need to be introduced to the market.

3. A simple car to be used for local innercity driving

4. Conversions of existing vehicles are needed</description>
