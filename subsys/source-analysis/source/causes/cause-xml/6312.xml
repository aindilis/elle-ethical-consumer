  <description>For those of you who know Galway, it has very little going for it. 

Home to most of the itinerant population of Ireland it make scenes from Gangs of New York seem like Alice's Tea party.

But now they have discovered that their water is in fact a diluted form of diarrhea. 

This is why galwegian have such bad breath. Which in turn is why in-breeding has risen to such dangerous levels. Consanguinity related disease is rising daily.

Now I ask you to join with me and eradicate this problem.  Education, more education, some new sewage filters and sexy sheep. That is all we need.

We cannot expect to fix the water scenario overnight, so in the mean time we are going to provide the locals with high quality hooker sheep.

Thank you for helping.
