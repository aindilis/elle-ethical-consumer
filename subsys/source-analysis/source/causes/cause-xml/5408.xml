  <description>For those of you who know me pretty well, know that in November of 2006 my father passed away from this terrible disease called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrigs disease.  This is one of the worst diseases to be cursed with. You start off noticing that your muscles are twitching a lot more than normal and that certain simple things in life such as opening a jar or holding a pen are becoming a little harder to perform. Then you start to notice that you are losing weight dramatically because the disease is killing the nerve cell endings in your muscles causing your muscles to disintegrate.  Which in turn causes you to waste away to nothing but skin and bone.  There is no known cause of this disease, what the doctors do know is that it is not genetic, not viral or bacterial and it is not infectious either.  There is also no known cure.  The only medicine for this disease prolongs life only by three to four months and causes miserable side effects.  There are few research facilities for this disease because of the relatively low number of people who have it and that needs to change.  

1. To promote education of the disease

2. To encourage more research of the disease

3. To find an end to this disease</description>
