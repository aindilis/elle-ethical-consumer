  <description>Meals For The Elderly is a private, nonprofit, charitable organization devoted to serving the homebound elderly of San Angelo with one hot, nutritious, home-delivered meal each weekday, while ensuring their individual well-being through personal contact.

1. It is our goal to enable the elderly to live independently, in their own homes, for as long as possible.

2. We support seniors in our community who are unable to prepare their own meals or are unable to attain meals.</description>
