  <description>SQUINA uses Sharks for one of their products, it is called SQUINA SHARK CAPSULE, it is supposed to prevent cancer, sharks are also used for food such as Shark fin soup.  I find it unfair.  do you?  Sharks unlike some animals only breed one baby at a time, also they catch sharks from the ocean.  Think of the sharks extincting!

1. People should stop catching Sharks from the Ocean.

2. Sharks should be protected under law.</description>
