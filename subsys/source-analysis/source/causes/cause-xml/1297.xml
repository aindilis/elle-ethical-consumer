  <description>Over the past 200 years since colonisation the Australian Aboriginal community has been exploited, ignored and in some extreme cases targeted by the imposed by international convicts and immigrants.

Too many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders continue to live without equal access to basic health conditions and the acceptance by the wider community that non-Indigenous Australians take for granted.

1. Australian Aboriginals must be treated as equals within the community. Racism must be stamped out within the non-indigenous community.

2. The Australian government and people must recognise the Aboriginal community as traditional land owners.

3. The Australian goverment must work towards a healthy, educated aboriginal population using both financial aid and social change within both the indigenous and non-indigenous communities.

4. DO NOT DONATE HERE!!! Donate directly to OXFAM Australia. Facebook does not support Australian charities.</description>
