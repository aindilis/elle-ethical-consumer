  <description>CLSACC serves more than 1,000 clients each year, largely through the efforts of its nearly 100 volunteers.    CLSACC helps counter the effect of poverty and violence on some of the most vulnerable members of the community: battered women and their children; people with disabilities; those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness; immigrants seeking political asylum; the uninsured and underinsured who cannot find the mental health counseling they need elsewhere.

1. Legal assistance and affordable, quality mental health counseling should be available to all.</description>
