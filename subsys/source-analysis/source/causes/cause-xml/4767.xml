  <description>Whenever I walk past homeless people I always want to give something, but never money, because you never know what their situation is.

So, one day I decided to give a sandwich instead. That way I know they'll have something to eat that day.

Let's see if we can all do the same thing.

1. Give Homeless People Food Not Money

2. Homeless People Need Food Too

3. Sandwiches for Homeless People</description>
