CHOSA takes a holistic approach to the community development process.  We operate through partnerships with local organizations, enabling them to address the immediate needs of the children while simultaneously striving for long-term transformation of the social environment.  This comprehensive approach is rooted in the realization that sustainable change will come from within the community when participation leads to local action, self-empowerment and community-owned development.
