  <description>In early 2007, Thompson embarked on what he calls a &#8220;dialogue&#8221; with the American people, through his various venues, to determine whether there was a desire among American voters for him to enter Republican Presidential race. Along the way, sites such as &#8220;Draft Fred Thompson,&#8221; &#8220;Fred Head&#8221; and &#8220;Fred Facts&#8221; proliferated online. In June, Thompson filed papers that would allow him to raise funds to further explore a presidential run. 

One can&#8217;t help but see that Thompson again might be hearing the call to serve. As he discussed less than six months ago, a door is opening and this time Fred Dalton Thompson may lead all of America through it.
