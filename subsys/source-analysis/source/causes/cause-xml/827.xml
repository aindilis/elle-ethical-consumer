  <description>This cause is about becoming aware of and combating the imminent destruction of a critical site of world heritage.

The Hill of Tara is Ireland's ancient capital, with a complex of approximately 200 monuments on and around it. Now the Irish Government is building a motorway through it.

Please visit http://www.tarawatch.org for more information or email info@tarawatch.org

1. UNESCO should declare the Hill of Tara a World Heritage Site,  but insist the M3 motorway is rerouted first

2. World Monuments Fund placed Tara on the 2008 List of 100 Most Endangered Sites 

3. The Irish Government should halt works at Tara until the European Court of Justice decides if they are legal

4. We only want the M3 re-routed, and are not opposing the motorway per se

5. For more information please visit http://www.tarawatch.org and http://www.hilloftara.info and email us at info@tarawatch.org</description>
