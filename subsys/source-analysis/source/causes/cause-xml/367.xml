  <description>Genarlow Wilson, who is but one of the many victims of the judicial system was convicted of aggravated child molestation in 2004, at the age of 17. This charge stems from a New Years eve party that occurred in 2003, in which a 15 year old girl engaged in consensual oral sex with Genarlow Wilson. Originally Genarlow Wilson was charged with rape also, but this charge was dropped once a video of the incident surfaced. Since Genarlow Wilson refused to take a plea bargain, which would have resulted him being labeled a sex offender for the rest of his life, and not being able to have contact with his little sister, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
	 The thing is if Genarlow Wilson had intercourse with said victim instead of oral sex, he would have only been subject to a minimum of 5 years in prison. Jury members have even stated that they were not even aware that Genarlow Wilson would be subject to a 10 year prison term. Ironically after Genarlow Wilson was convicted of this crime, this law was then changed to a misdemeanor where said convicted person would receive a maximum sentence of one year in prison, and would not have to register as a sex offender. But since laws are not retroactive, Genarlow Wilson who was a star athlete and had a gpa of 3.2 still remains in prison after three years.

1. Genarlow Wilson's struggle must not be forgotten.

2. Genarlow Wilson must be set free from prison.</description>
