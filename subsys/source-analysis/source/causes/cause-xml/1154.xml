  <description>This is a double trip both at 6 months and most likely will continue past the first two trips. The trip is to film a documentary on  global warming, animal abuse, spousal/child abuse, torture, war, genocide, the preservation of wildlife in their natural ecosystems, religion, famine, and the biggest thing of all, peace. A lot of people say that a few guys cannot make a difference by filming all of this or doing that. However, they are incorrect. The more support from you guys, the more this spreads, the more it will make a difference.

1. Global warming is an issue that needs to be immediatly addressed in order to ensure the salvation of humanity

2. The Genocide in Africa is much bigger then WW2 but we do nothing

3. Every Human is entitled to, food, shelter, clothing, security</description>
