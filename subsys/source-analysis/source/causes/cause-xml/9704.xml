  <description>Please support me as I Walk for Justice on September 16th! The Walk is an annual fundraising event sponsored by Headwaters Foundation for Justice for local organizations and community programs to raise money for THEIR work! It's truly a unique opportunity for groups to raise much needed funds for the community building work they do. 

I am raising money for Indigenous Peoples Task Force. My goal is $500. This year, Indigenous Peoples Task Force is working to raise $10,000 to support the transition of the Maynidoowahdak Odena housing complex to serve Native Americans with disabilities, including but no longer limited to people living with HIV/ AIDS.

Thanks to all of you for supporting the agency I work for and Native people with HIV and or other disabilities.
