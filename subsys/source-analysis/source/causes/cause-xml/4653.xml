  <description>The ASA's vision is to have science and theology interacting and affecting one another in a positive light. The organization was founded in 1941 by five men: Irving Cowperthwaite, F. Alton Everest, John Van Haitsma, Peter Stoner and Russell Sturgis. There are 2,500 members and subscribers in the American Scientific Affiliation. ASA sponsors an annual meeting, a quarterly journal ("Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith"), a bimonthly newsletter, and local section meetings across the U.S. Affiliated with ASA is the Canadian Scientific and Christian Affiliation (CSCA). ASA has a listserv and Web site. The benefits of the organization accrue at the Faith/Science interface.

1. 1.	We accept the divine inspiration, trustworthiness and authority of the Bible in matters of faith and conduct. 

2. 2.	We confess the Triune God affirmed in the Nicene and Apostles' creeds which we accept as brief, faithful statements of Christian doctrine based upon Scripture. 

3. 3.	We believe that in creating and preserving the universe God has endowed it with contingent order and intelligibility, the basis of scientific investigation. 

4. 4.	We recognize our responsibility, as stewards of God's creation, to use science and technology for the good of humanity and the whole world. </description>
