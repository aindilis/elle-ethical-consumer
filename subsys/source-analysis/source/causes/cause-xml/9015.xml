  <description>Throughout history, zombies, amongst other Undead Creatures, have been discriminated against and been the targets of racism for millenia. With the creation of games such as "Resident Evil", TV shows such as "The Dresden Files", and books such as "The Zombie Survival Guide", the children of today have been brainwashed and trained to participate in the genocide of The Undead. 

We have told ourselves for nearly 60 years, "Never Again." After the Holocaust, after Bosnia, after Rwanda, after millions of innocent people died, we said we would not allow it to happen again. Now, we must make good on that promise, and make sure that The Undead can live freely and peacefully in any Realm they choose.

1. The gross misrepresentation of Zombies must end now.

2. Zombies were people too!

3. The Natural Rights of life (before and after death), liberty, and the persuit of happiness (be it eating brains or otherwise) should be guaranteed to everyone and everything in existence.</description>
