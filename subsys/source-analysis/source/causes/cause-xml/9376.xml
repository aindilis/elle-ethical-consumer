  <description>People all over the world are being infected FSD everyday.  But no one takes it seriously because the only symtoms to FSD is an extreme craving for fruit snacks.  Scientists have been researching FSD for many years now and have finally found the cure.  The cure is in the Fruit Snacks themselves.  Just like diabetes victims who need insulin, FSD victims need a dose of fruit snacks every day.  Please donate fruit snacks to Brian Miller who is currently infected with the worst case of FSD the world has ever seen.  If you know any other FSD victims, or potential FSD victims, please give them fruit snacks.  Thank you.  Gushers Triple Berry Shock, and Twistables (mixed berry, or strawberry NOT sour apple) are the best known fruit snacks, and usually hold an FSD victim over for a couple days.  Thank you.

1. Fruit snacks must be given to FSD victims all the time.

2. Fruit snacks are awesome.

3. MmmmmmmMMMmm... Fruit Snacks!</description>
