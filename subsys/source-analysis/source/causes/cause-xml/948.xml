  <description>The ITL Hall is the new Exam Hall in a selected few Choueifat Schools. It is all computerized and we have to do our exams on the computer. It always reduces our marks and lowers our school's (ISC Dubai) average than the other schools who do not have the ITL Hall.

1. Demolish ITL Hall.

2. Only do AMS there, not weeklys.

3. Turn down the A.C.

4. Fix the stupid computers that break down everytime.

5. Remove the mike wielding people who say the same thing over and over again.</description>
