  <description>Since 1987, there has been a rebel group in Uganda, called the Lords Resistance Army (further referred to as the LRA). The LRA is an army that has previously started to lose support from adults, and has taken to kidnapping children in order to feed their army. During the night, the LRA comes into the city and kidnaps children as young as six years old to serve in their army. They then train the children to kill and fight. Not only is there a brutal training process, but if children try to escape, or do not meet the satisfaction of the older soldiers, they are then killed. 

We hope to spread this story using the power of music. We want to show teens that they can make a difference.

1. Music is a power that can be used to raise awareness

2. The children in Uganda need attention and support--NOW

3. Seeing a concert with amazing music can be made into a way to increase support and raise money</description>
