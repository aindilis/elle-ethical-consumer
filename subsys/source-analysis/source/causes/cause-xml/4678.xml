  <description>The Breast Cancer 3-Day is a 60-mile walk that takes place in the Twin Cities in August over the course of 3 days.  Training for this walk and walking it in August will be brutal on our bodies, unbearably hot, and most likely very uncomfortable especially because we will be sleeping in tents, waking up at 5 a.m. to walk 8-10 hours each day and showering in semis.  Being uncomfortable for 3 days, however, is nothing compared to the everyday battle in the lives of women, men and their families dealing with breast cancer.  

So please support me as I take on the wonderful challenge of raising $2,200 and walking 60 miles (a few hundred with training!). Net proceeds benefit Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the National Philanthropic Trust, funding important breast cancer research, education, screening, and treatment.  And all donations are tax-deductible.

I will be walking in memory of my wonderful grandma who passed away due to breast cancer 9 years ago.  I am walking so others, like me, aren't denied time with their mothers, grandmothers, sisters, friends or daughters.  Please help me in this journey!

1. Breast Cancer Sucks!

2. There will be an estimated 180,510 new cases of breast cancer in women AND men in 2007.

3. 1 woman is diagnosed with breast cancer every 3 minutes, and 1 woman dies from it every 13 minutes in the U.S.</description>
