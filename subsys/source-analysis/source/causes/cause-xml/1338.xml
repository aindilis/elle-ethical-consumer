Millions of people each year are diagnosed with cancer; thousands will die within the first six months.  Statistics say that everyone will eventually be affected someway by this disease - whether it be a family member, friend, or even being diagnosed themselves.

Cancer is NOT always terminal.  These children, these adults, these people deserve a fighting chance to live.  Give them ten-fifty more years with their familes by supporting cancer research.

Arkansas Childrens Hospital (ACH) is a non profit organization located in Little Rock, AR that has become world renowned for it's efforts in cancer research. It is the only pediatric medical center in Arkansas and one of the largest in the United States serving kids from birth to age 21.  

Please help support this amazing foundation so that millions of children and adults alike can fight this disease.
