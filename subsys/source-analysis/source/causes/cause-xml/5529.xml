  <description>Hey,

This is Scott Kirkwood and this past friday and saturday I held a party at my house and my mom called me on my phone soon after getting home saying that thousands of dollars in Tiffany's Gold as well as other high quality gold necklaces were stolen from her jewelry drawer. I also had a clock radio stolen which although not as expensive is of value to me and costs around $100. The jewelry on the other hand, is valued in the thousands and I just want to get the word out and have anyone who knows anything about this to please contact me. If the holder of the jewelry does hear about this or ends up reading this please return the jewelry to the house with no questions asked. I also strongly urge this person to return these items or police WILL BE involved, in which case there will be consequences. 

1. I allowed kjids to be at my house.

2. I trusted everyone who showed up.

3. I didn't know some people who showed.

4. Police will be involved if someone does not come forward!</description>
