  <description>My mother was diagnosed with ovarian and melanoma cancer. I don't remember the exact year, but I do remember how hard it was for my mom to go through this. She did survive this cancer longer than the doctors expected. Even though she survived, the cancer never fully went away.

I want people to know that majority of women find out too late that they have this cancer and have the possiblity of dieing.

1. Ovarian cancer needs to be known.

2. Find a cure</description>
  <mission>To help find a cure, and spread the word to women about this cancer.</mission>
