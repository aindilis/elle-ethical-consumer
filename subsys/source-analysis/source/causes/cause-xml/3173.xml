  <description>My causse is for every person  of legal age in there  providence or  territory to donate  1$ each to help get  people off the streets get  them a place to live.Give them a chance  to get back on their feet.Or  go back to  school or get there ged.If we all help we will end homeless living on the streets dieing in the winter,rember some of these people have children with them going sometimes not eating for days.So if your like me send this to all your friends and help out our fellow  canadians becase our goverment only worries about getting raises while our elderly eats dog and cat food..So lets help build affordable housing and get these people off the streets and our eldely eating proper  because were only  young once.
