  <description>We must respect, love, honor, cherish, and represent ourselves. We must be true to ourselves, and realize that only true love comes from within. We have to love ourselves and be true to ourselves. When we are  true to ourselves, we don't have to feel insecure around others or change when certain people come around. 

We are Leaders and We stay true to ourselves.

All those who fall short, must then follow. Maybe one day they can then lead like we are doing today....But they must figure out who they are first!

To Thine Own Self be True!!!

1. Honesty must be in the hearts of us all.

2. Having knowledge of yourself is key.

3. We must be true to ourselves!</description>
