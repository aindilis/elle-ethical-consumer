  <description>Hey guys,
I am in need of your help! So I am going to the Dominincan Republic Tuesday, July 31st. For some time now I have been working on finding a way to get the clothes down there.

I have $600 from Kiwanis but it is going to cost more due to the amount of clothing donations I received.

If you would donate $5, I would be able to get all the clothing down there. They would benefit so many people. Thank you!

Invite others to Donate. Thank you, again!


1. Every Child no matter where they live deserves a pair of shoes!

2. Children should not have to walk around without underwear or pants!

3. We can help everyone, by doing it one person at a time!</description>
