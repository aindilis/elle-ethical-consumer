  <description>I'm looking to  find anyone that's eager to create a disease that turns people into zombies. If we could turn ordinary people into flesh-eating lurching zombies, it would be cool. Zombies have long been the subject of various movies, which have been cool. But what if we could actually DO it? That would be cool. This is a serious matter and is no joke. 

Im looking for anyone thats eager to help me with this project and can donate their time and money. Any proceeds will be greatly appreciated and by just joining you can help!

So join up now and change the world! Ordinary people have been around for too long.



1. Zombies are cool 

2. Zombies are better than rocks

3. The Mars Volta is a cool band</description>
