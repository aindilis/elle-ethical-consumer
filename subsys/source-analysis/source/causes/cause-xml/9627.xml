  <description>Canada's Boreal forest is one of the largest tracts of ancient forest left in the world. Almost 80 per cent of the Earth's original forests have already been degraded or completely destroyed, making the protection of our Boreal forest all the more important. 
One of the major threats to Canada's Boreal ecosystem is clearcut logging to make disposable products such as toilet paper and facial tissue. Greenpeace is working to stop the destruction of Canada's largest intact ecosystem by trying to persuade consumers, institutions and companies to choose ancient forest friendly tissue products - ones made from 100 per cent recycled content.
