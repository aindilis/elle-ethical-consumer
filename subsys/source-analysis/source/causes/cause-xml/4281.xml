  <description>VH1's Save the Music Foundation has been in existence since 1997. 

Save the Music provides new music instruments to schools which have had budget cuts in their music departments. 

According to their website, http://www.vh1.com/partners/save_the_music, since 1997 they have provided nearly $34 million worth of musical instruments to 1,400 public schools in 80 cities. 

1. Save the Music believes that providing instruments instead of funds, their contributions will go 100% towards restoring music programs in public schools. 

2. Research shows that participating in music education allows a student to excell more in math, self-esteem, discipline, SAT scores, and other various areas that can help a student succeed in school. </description>
