  <description>"Outside In" is a Portland-based not-for-profit organization aimed at helping homeless Portland youth. The organization provides all kinds of very important support, such as housing, medical clinics, a needle-exchange program, transgender/sexual identity services, and scholarships, among other things, for street kids. According to their website, 80% of homeless youth who go through their transitional housing program never return to the streets. Think about that statistic- this organization is changing kids' lives in the biggest way possible- taking them off the streets and getting them started on a new, safe path through support and love.
