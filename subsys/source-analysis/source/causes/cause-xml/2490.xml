  <description>I will be running the 26.2 mile Maui Marathon on September 16th, 2007 for the Arthritis Foundation as a member of the Joints in Motion training team.  Prior to this marathon, I will raise $4000 in support of arthritis research and community-based education programs for the men, women and children affected by arthritis.

Please assist me in achieving my fundraising goal by making a donation to the Arthritis Foundation. Your generosity ensures that the Arthritis Foundation continues leading the way toward prevention, control and a cure of the number one cause of disability.  You can make a donation using a credit card by visiting my webpage at

Thank you very much for your support!


1. Arthritis is the leading cause of diability in the US and we need to work together toward prevention, control and a cure.  

2. Arthritis affects one in three people, including men, women, teens and even children.</description>
