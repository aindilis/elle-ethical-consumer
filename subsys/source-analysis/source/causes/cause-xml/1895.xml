  <description>The Haitian culture is beautiful and worth millions. so why are the people starving and homeless?

People need to raise awareness for this beautiful country.  Only one cruise line visits the country because of the political unrest and the fear that people have for the place.  But think about this.  Since that Cruise line started coming, they began to hire people from the nearby villages to come and work for them on the island.  They are a huge chunk of the money that Haiti takes in yearly.  Royal Carribean Cruise lines has been going to Haiti for approximately ten years and when they started, only 10% of the nearest villages population was able to afford school.  Now 90%can.  think of the amount of help that can be done with just one more Cruise line going there.

People are frightened of the place because of the political unrest ad yet the reason it stays that way is because Visitors are their main income and no one visits.  So join the cause and help save a land of ancient beauty and culture from imploding.

1. People deserve education and housing

2. Awareness of the Haitian need has to be spread

3. Every little bit helps in a place where 200 dollars is a high yearly wage.</description>
