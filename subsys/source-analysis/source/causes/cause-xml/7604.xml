  <description>This summer my life was touched at a Church camp in Panama City Beach, Florida called BigStuf. This camp is a sponsor of Compassion. Compassion is a program that allows people all over the world to sponsor kids and help change the qualites of their lifes. These kids need our help, God is calling us to help keep the Rhythm of the World. Please do what you can do to help. : )

1. Kenya's lack of clean water must end to save millions of life's.

2. Children need our help to be able to succeed in their lifes and fullfill their dreams.

3. These amazing people need our help to give them medicine for their illnesses.</description>
