  <description>Many have heard of the concept of the "Hydogen Highway" that is being pushed by Canadian and American goverments today. The idea is all based around hydrogen cars.

Although it is true that the cars themselves will not produce CO2 THEY RUN ON HYDROGEN!

WHERE DO THE GOVERNMENTS PLAN ON GETTING THE HYDROGEN FROM?

FOSSIL FUELS!

This process of dissociating the hydrogen from fossil fuels releases the carbon which then forms CO2. How much CO2? THE SAME AS BURNING THE FOSSIL FUELS!

This is a front. Although hydrogen can be obtained from water through a electrolysis process this takes far to much energy and the ONLY economically viable source of hydrogen is fossil fuels. Don't buy into this scam.



1. Governments can't come up with a true solution to the burning of fossil fuels so they alter the process of harvesting  energy from fossil fuels to divert public interest.</description>
  <mission>Force the governments to find a real solution to the emissions problems instead of diverting the public's view.</mission>
