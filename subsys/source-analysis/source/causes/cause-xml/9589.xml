  <description>Childhaven's programs are designed to help abused, neglected and at-risk infants, toddlers and preschoolers ages one month through five years form healthy emotional attachments, learn to know and trust adults and develop interactive skills necessary to form other secure relationships.  Many of our children have experienced neglect or abuse due in large part to their parents' untreated substance abuse, mental illness or abuse and neglect they experienced as children.

Research indicates that if left untreated, abused and neglected children are six times more likely to commit serious and violent crimes as teenagers.  Early intervention is key to breaking the cycle of abuse and neglect.  We are a part of their lives during the critical period of brain development.  Childhaven's programs have a proven and positive long-term impact on these children.
