  <description>St. Baldrick's began as a casual conversation between friends and has exploded into the world's biggest volunteer-driven fundraising program for childhood cancer! Events have taken place in 10 countries and 42 US states, raising over $20 million, and shaving more than 26,000 heads.

Despite the more than $20 million raised in our first seven years, the St. Baldrick's community understands that our mission is far from over. Worldwide, 160,000 children are diagnosed with cancer each year, and while the challenge to treat them has never been greater, scientific research has also never been more promising.

Our goal is to fund cures which assure each child a long and healthy life. We also wish to make the St. Baldrick's program available to the best childhood cancer organizations throughout the world, so all can baldly stand in solidarity with these special children, encouraging medical collaboration which will speed progress in research.

We need your help to spread the word that all are welcome in the St. Baldrick's community. We vow to keep shaving until every child can be cured, and as always, you can expect us to be faithful to our founding principles of trust, integrity, efficiency, and a pioneering spirit and sense of fun.

Join us and be a hero for children with cancer.
