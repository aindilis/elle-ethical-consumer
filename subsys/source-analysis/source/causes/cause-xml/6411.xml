  <description>What is a micronation? People may think a micronation is simply a form of goofing off with a formal flair, but it is not. A micronation is a group of individuals who share common beliefs and political principals who wish to break off from a country that is already established to live in and run their own society. Starting a micronation is no different than how Canada or even the US started; people with their own ideals came to North America (Puritans) to live unpersecuted for their beliefs. Then more and more people began coming to the New World. They declared their independence, and Britain came over to put a stop to it. Even though it's a well-known story, I consider where we live today in North America as micronations; but that's the thing, they aren't Micro- as they are full-sized nations. A micronation can be the size of someone's backyard to 100's of acres of land. As the Vice President of an already-running micronation (Durkadurkagradstania), I believe it is the people's right to choose to break off and live in their own society. If you already run a micronation, or now wish to do so, join this cause. Together we will fight to make our voices heard, and hopefully make a change in the future. 

1. To have all micronations, no matter how big or small, to be recognized by major-world powers.

2. To establish a form of communication and peace between all micronations.</description>
