  <description>Every day, we lose more and more battlefield land. This resource is non-renewable and as we plow over this hallowed ground, we will never again be able to fully appreciate its integrity. The lands on which battles were fought provide all Americans with an understanding of its history, heritage, and national identity.

Urban sprawl threatens to eradicate many battlefields and if the American people do not address the issue, they may be lost for all time.

Honoring those that gave their lives so that we may live the way we do may first begin through the preservation of the land these men fought on. Whether it is the Revolution, War of 1812, Civil War, or any other, the battlefields here in America deserve protection and preservation to ensure future generations enjoy them as we do today.

1. Civil War battlefields are a resource which we lose more and more of every day. This resource is non-renewable and must be preserved for future generations.

2. The value of battlefields is multi-faceted and provides many services to Americans of all races and ages. 

3. As an example of the American experience, we must save battlefields to honor those who made the supreme sacrifice for what they believed.</description>
