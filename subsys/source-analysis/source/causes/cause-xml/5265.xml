  <description>For ten years the Lions and Leo clubs in Norway have supported the foundation of PRR in Constanta, Romania. The ultimate goal is to finish and open the orphanage and educational centre now sitting in a village near Constanca. Only a few more things need to be in place for thiswonderful place to have all the necesary documents and permits to open its doors to 20 - 30 street children, give them a place to stay, teach them a trade, and eventuallt get them a job and a home of their own.

This way of collecting, will send the money to a US lions club, who then will forward the funds to us in Lions MD104 Norway.

This will provide hope for the future for children that today are destined to live on the street, steal from tourists, and end up either as dead, or in prison.

Help the young kids get a life.

1. Children must have a future

2. International humanitarian aid

3. Education, food and house for children.</description>
