  <description>Citizens of this Country must rise up with a united front against Crime, Criminals and the utter disregard the system has for the Victims. This country is slowing drowning in Crime and all of it's effects. The government seems to want to pretend that things are improving but it is just a BLATENT lie. Everyone I speak to, including the police and armed response companies, agree that the number 1 problem facing the future of this beautiful land is Crime. Lord only knows what would happen if the middle classes were not spending so much money on security, alarms, private guards, etc. It would be total anarchy. Mr Mbeki and his followers need to wake up and admit that they are losing control. The Fear of Crime, let alone the actual act itself, means people are afraid. Afraid for their lives, their children, their property and most of all their sanity. FFS do something!!!!!!

1. Every Law Abiding Citizen has the right to live without Fear.

2. Criminals must be punished. 

3. Victims must be supported.

4. We need more Police.

5. The Police need to be better trained, better resourced and better paid.</description>
