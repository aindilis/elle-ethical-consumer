  <description>The Texas &#8220;Baby Moses&#8221; or &#8220;Safe Haven&#8221; law provides a responsible alternative to mothers who might otherwise abandon, neglect or harm a newborn child. It states that a parent may leave an unharmed infant, up to 60 days old, at any hospital or fire station with &#8220;no questions asked.&#8221;

Since the legislature provided no funds to publicize this law, privately funded non-profit groups in every metropolitan area in Texas have instituted public awareness campaigns. In Dallas County this group is called Baby Moses Dallas.

1. Every woman deserves to be educated about her rights and options.

2. Every baby deserves a chance to live.</description>
