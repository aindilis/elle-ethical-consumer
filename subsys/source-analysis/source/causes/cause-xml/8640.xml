  <description>There are groups on Facebook that are working to help make Canada a more accessible place. If the smaller groups come together under a larger umbrella, maybe we can make a stronger impact. 

If you're American, please join us as well. The ADA has been in place for years, and some people might argue the need for legislation on accessibility issues in Canada due to their perceptions of the ADA's effects in the States or their perceptions of the ability of Canadian human rights laws to accomplish what we're trying to do.

Other recommended groups are Toward an Albertans (and Canadians) with Disabilities Act, I want to make Canada the most accessible and inclusive country, and Making Bars and Clubs More Accessible (I have to check the name of that group to make sure it's right.)


1. Canada must work toward making our country more accessible for people with disabilities.</description>
