  <description>This lovely outdoor theatre is really suffering from the rain. The news really caught my attention last week. I really would like to at least contribute to this program which I eventually hope to work for in the future as a professional actor.

1. Save any theatre in need.

2. Support DFW proffessional theatre.

3. Help every actor.</description>
