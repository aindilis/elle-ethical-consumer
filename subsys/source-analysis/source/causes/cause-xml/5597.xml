  <description>The National Wildlife Refuge Association (NWRA) is the only national organization dedicated solely to protecting the Refuge System. With the guidance of retired refuge professionals and experienced volunteers, NWRA is uniquely positioned to address the challenges and become the System's most vocal and consistent advocate. Our strategy:

    * harness the power of the 220 local "Friends of the Refuge" volunteer groups;
    * forge partnerships with other leading national organizations around targeted refuge issues; and
    * capture the national and local media spotlight to draw attention to refuges.

By acting now, we can reconcile the needs of people and wildlife and ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy our unique natural treasures. By building support among the American people, we can protect this most valuable resource - our nation's wildlife trust.

1. Protecing, enhancing, and expanding the NWRS is more important than ever.

2. Keeping our environment and wildlife diverse is an integral part to all life, including ours.

3. Helping our lands remain beautiful, natural, and pristine will help future generations apreciate nature and the world around them.</description>
