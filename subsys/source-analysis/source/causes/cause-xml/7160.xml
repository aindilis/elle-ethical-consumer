  <description>Everyone is special, beautiful, and unique no matter what anyone else says. 

Other people have put  false notions about love into our minds and I want everyone to know that we all deserve a chance at love, and will find it one day. 

Many relationships are bulit on physical elements, and with all the divorce, anger, and evil in this world it seems like people no longer believe in true love and happy endings; but they exist.
So for our generation and those that follow, we need to reach out and stand together and fight for love. 

They may have said you weren't good enough, attractive enough, smart enough, but the truth is you are. You're amazing! 

All you need is hope, faith, and love 

Tomorrow will be a better day and you are never alone I promise!



1. Everyone deserves a chance at love 

2. Love can only be seen with the heart 

3. Find out who you are and be happy with yourself </description>
