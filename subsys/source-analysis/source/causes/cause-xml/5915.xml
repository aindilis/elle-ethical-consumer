  <description>MRKH Syndrome, or Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome, is an uncommon variation in the prenatal development of the female genital tract.  Girls who are born with this are born with a short or nonexistent vagina, no cervix, and a partial or absent uterus. The causes are unknown. 

This is to bring awareness of MRKH Syndrome, and the girls who have it, or have something like it. 

1. Gender and Sexuality are much more complex than what we call "normal"

2. 1:2000 children are born with a medical condition that does not conform to gender and sexual norms and diagosed with a "sexual abnormality." The stigma of diagnosis is often more harmful than the condition.

3. Having a genital defect like this does not in anyway make them less of a woman.  

4. When medical personal come up across a girl like this, they need to treat her as someone normal, and not some kind of freak.</description>
