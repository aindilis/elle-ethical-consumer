  <description>We believe in the fundamental right of all children to have the security and love of a family and as such, we resolve to facilitate adoption of special needs, older and sibling children by providing financial grants to special waiting children; to actively seek out healthy and happy families who can offer love and support to waiting children; to raise public awareness of the need for healthy homes for special needs, older, and sibling children and to raise public awareness of the unique joys of parenting a special child.
