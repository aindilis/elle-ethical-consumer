  <description>The American Cancer Society has a long-standing tradition of mobilizing volunteers to address cancer issues within communities across the United States.  Recently, the Society has turned to you, COLLEGE STUDENTS, to increase cancer awareness on campuses across the United States, to help raise money to fund cancer research and patient service programs, to lobby Congress, and to help reach out to cancer patients.  

These new opportunities are changing the lives of cancer patients and giving college students valuable volunteer experiences.  As a Colleges Against Cancer volunteer, you can gain important experience that will help you as you begin to look at graduate, law, or medical school...or as you seek your first job.



1. Cancer does not discriminate.  It doesn't care how old you are, what race you are, or whether or not you are insured.

2. Everyone knows someone touched by cancer.

3. Cancer prevention and education are SO IMPORTANT in eliminating this disease.</description>
