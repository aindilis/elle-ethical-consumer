  <description>In August of 2005, Kala Hawkins was diagnosed with Leukemia. She was originally supposed to undergo eight months of chemotherapy, but she only made it through three. On November 3, 2005.. she passed away. She was a great influence on many around her, and is a hero to tons!

I've started numerous fundraisers and such towards this disease.. and you can check them out.. more are to come! Things are being scheduled now. :)
