  <description>In 2005 a group of high school students decided that they wanted to raise awareness of the HIV/AIDS epidemic that affects their brothers and sisters in Africa. The goal: Raise 23 million pennies (230,000 dollars) each representing one of the then, 23 million people infected with HIV/AIDS living in Sub-Saharan Africa/Build bridges across cultures and oceans in support of a greater world community.

The lives of over 23 million people are involved in this project and you may be asking, "what can I do?" The currency of this project ultimately is the smallest (qualitative) coin. This is a project in which even the simplest donation is represented in a BIG way. By giving a penny, not only are you contributing to the total amount of money invested in the project, supporting those in need and joining/creating a larger world community but you are recognizing a growing problem, learning about it and actively working to change it. If your heart is warmed at all by this cause, then this is a success.
