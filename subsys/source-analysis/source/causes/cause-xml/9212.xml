  <description>It feels like it takes a lot of strenght and character to survive the media pressure of the "who to be and look like". 
This media managed raw model has become the biggest hunting nightmare since the inquisition and the source of many life threatening conditions such as low-selfesteem, anorexia, drug-addiction, depression and even suicide.
Myself having been a victim of this invisible enemy my whole life, feel like I want to strike back by launching a campaign against the lack of real values that "modern society" and publicity are impossing and promote the rising of TRUE BEAUTY instead. The one that comes from inside and it's different and beautiful in each one of us. The one that really matters, makes us special, who we are and lets us shine.
Don't know how far I'll get with this in life, but have been picturing this for a long time and well... FACEBOOK is a start.

1. REAL BEAUTY COMES FROM INSIDE

2. NO ONE TELLS ME HOW OR WHO I SHOULD BE LIKE

3. IT'S WHO YOU ARE AND NOT WHO YOU SEEM TO BE WHO I CARE ABOUT 

4. DON'T NEED NOR WANT ANY DONATIONS, only allies; so if you decide to join you can skip the last step and just become a memeber.</description>
