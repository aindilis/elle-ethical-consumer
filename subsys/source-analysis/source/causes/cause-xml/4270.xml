  <description>I have just finished my undergrad at UC Davis and will be going into full-time missions starting in September with an 11 month mission trip to 11 different countries called THE WORLD RACE. I will travel minimally with my teammates carrying everything we need for the year on our backs and sleeping on the ground in order to better serve the people we will be ministering to. For more information go to http://www.theworldrace.org/. 

I have to raise approximately $18,000 in order to go so I need your help! If every one of my friends on facebook gave $10 I would be significantly closer to my goal.

If you would like to support me please go to:
https://www.adventures.org/give/donate.asp?giveto=worldrace&amp;desc=For%20Kelly%20O'Bar

and fill out the form!

I will also be keeping a blog during my preparations and after I leave. Check it out and sign-up for e-mail updates at: http://kellyobar.theworldrace.org

If you're interested in committing to pray for me regularly please send me a facebook message and I'll give you the details!

Thanks again. Much Love,
Kelly
