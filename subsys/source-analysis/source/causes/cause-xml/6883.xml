  <description>The Association of Gospel Rescue Missions (AGRM) represents 300 rescue missions and other ministries that minister to homeless and poor people in communities in North America.  Since 1913, AGRM member ministries have offered emergency food and shelter, youth and family services, prison and jail outreach, rehabilitation, and specialized programs for the mentally ill, the elderly, the urban poor and street youth.

Vision Statement

AGRM will foster and feed a movement of diverse energetic disciples who will see the practice of hospitality to the destitute as both a catalyst for life transformation in Jesus and a fundamental expression of their Christian faith, thus propelling the church into the lead role in society's quest to alleviate homelessness.

1. Rescue - Pulling people to safety from adverse conditions, and from choices and habits that lead to damage and death.

2. Redemption - Presenting people with a gospel that is about life transformation in Jesus, and the reclamation of His creation.

3. Rehabilitation - Helping people break the bonds of addiction and desperate behavior, and experience healing and wholeness.

4. Re-assimilation - Preparing people to dwell in community, and to have meaningful roles that lead to stability and missional living.</description>
