  <description>Dear Friends:  
 
Kenya project needs  about TWO hundred 128 megabits - 133 MHz speed and ONE hundred 256 megabits - 133 Hz speed   Without this help Kenya Project will not be able to ship about 300 computers. One memory card costs about $40.00 each. Willing donors can purchase the memories and ship them to us through the school address:
 
IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS HOW I CAN GET SOME OF THESE MEMORIES PLEASE ADVISE ME.
