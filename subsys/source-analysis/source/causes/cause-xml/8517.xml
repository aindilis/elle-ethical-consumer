  <description>Emo for the most part is disgusting!!!! Fall Out Boy epitomize this. From the cheesy song titles (thnks fr th mmrs wtf?????????), to their superficial lyrical approach, it all stinks.

It's fairly obvious that their label pays stations toplay their retarded watered down purile crap...this ain't a scene....wtf.

Let us all unite to rid the world of such soft 'art". Grow a ball bag, learn to write some decent songs!!!!!

1. Fall Out Boy are shit. period.</description>
