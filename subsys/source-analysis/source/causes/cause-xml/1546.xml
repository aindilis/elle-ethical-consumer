  <description>Without education in Africa, children have a bleak future - begging, prostitution, hunger, abuse, aids, poverty, starvation and premature death.

We can make a difference, educating many thousands if YOU get behind this campaign.

The aim is for a &#8220;tick box&#8221; to be added to every Independent School invoice, giving parents the opportunity to make a gift of &#163;40.00 a term (plus the tax relief &#8211; &#163;8.80) - "pairing" the education of their child with that of a child in the 3rd world - where school fees are about &#163;40 a term.

UK school fees are &#163;2000-&#163;8000 a term. Adding a &#163;40 gift is tiny, but the impact could be huge: life changing...... life saving.

Through FACEBOOK we want to show there is good support for the concept, encouraging schools and governors to get involved, ultimately saving children's lives.

PLEASE JOIN THIS PRESSURE GROUP!

Thanks for your support.
