  <description>We are the political arm of the pro-choice movement.  We develop and sustain a grassroots constituency that uses the political process to guarantee every woman the right to make personal decisions regarding the full range of reproductive choices, including preventing unintended pregnancy, bearing healthy children and choosing safe, legal, accessible abortion.

In the face of severe national threats to our right to choose, NARAL Pro-Choice Wisconsin is working on many fronts to protect reproductive freedom - in elections, in the state capitol, in local communities, and in the media. We need you to stand with us to stop abortion from becoming illegal in Wisconsin - which, under laws currently on the books, will happen immediately if Roe v. Wade is overthurned.  Help us put a pro-choice majority in the state assembly in 2008 and pass laws protecting our health, privacy, and rights!

NARAL Pro-Choice Wisconsin is leading the fight for choice on behalf of the women and families in our state. With more than 30,000 members throughout the state, our pro-choice constituency is strong.

1. Every woman has the right to make personal decisions regarding the full range of reproductive choices

2. All people deserve information and access to reproductive health care</description>
