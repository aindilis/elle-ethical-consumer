  <description>Seriously, why the hell not? He's funny, masculine [kinda] and above all a stud. Besides, he's also an amazing cook. Best kraft dinner you'll ever have. Ever...

oh, and any money you donate to this cause will go straight towards gifts for therrols partner. And by gifts I mean pot. And by "therrols partner" I really just mean therrol.

News:

June 14th: Congratulations team! We've got more members than the "pave over trees" cause! Keep recruiting and we'll try to beat those bastards from the "prevent global manbearpig attacks" (it's half man, half bear and half pig. Thats 1.5 times more deadly than your average animal)

June 15th: because of a few messages i've gotten, when I say "significant other of some form" I really wouldn't include livestock. Sorry, you freaks.

June 29th: PEOPLE ARE LEAVING?!? why would you do such a thing? Oh well, I suppose the jokes getting old. Recruit some people if you are feeling inclined.

July 29th: hmm.. long time since I said anything. I suppose I need a girl on vancouver island now. Also, ignore the pic. I don't have long hair anymore. Or braces.

I have been receiving very odd messages from people I don't know. 

1. Therrol is hillarious

2. If you run your fingers through therrols hair you can poof it out into a giant afro. What girl wouldn't want that?

3. Therrol will make you the best mixtape you've ever received. Is there anything more romantic than a mixtape?</description>
