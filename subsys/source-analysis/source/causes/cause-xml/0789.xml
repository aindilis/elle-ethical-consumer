  <description>Grab a sign a marker and yourself and make a "Free Hugs" Poster....now go out and start ging hugs!!!

we are the official "unofficial" FREE HUGS campain Cause on Facebook. We take our inspiration from the Sick Puppies Music Video and the example set by Juan Mann.

FYI the proceeds would go to Free Hugs if they were a non profit group. When i first made the group i did not think it would get this type of response so i just picked one which sounded nice. So the St. Louis Children's Hospital is our "offical non-profit" organization
