  <description>All of the tigers in the world are endangered.....about 3 subspecies are extinct already.Without help, this will only continue.  Wolves are also being killed just because of their need to kill for food.  Also, a mass number of elephants are still being killed for their tusks.  The rest of the elephant then goes to waste just laying there, mutilated.

1. animals are living beings too and deserve to live

2. if to many prey or preadators die,there will be an overpopulation of prey or not enough prey,therefore killing the predators who eat that prey</description>
