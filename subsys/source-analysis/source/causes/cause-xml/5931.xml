  <description>i want all bands to join this cause because i believe that if all bands get together we could start something huge! and im in this because if i could get my band and other bands together i would wanna play for the kids out there that are sick and that cant afford anything and that cant go to rock shoes or what ever music they like! i wanna play for kids with cancer i wanna play for anyone with cancer and i wanna play for the homeless and the people that have nothing! i wanna do something for somone else! whos with me?!?!

1. music dosnt just belong to celebrities it belongs to everyone!

2. people with nothing deserve something!

3. there are people out there that have more problems than we do, so why not give them something?</description>
