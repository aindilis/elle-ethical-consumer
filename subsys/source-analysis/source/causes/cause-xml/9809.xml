  <description>&lt;a href="http://onemillionwitnesses.com"&gt;
Onemillionwitnesses.com&lt;/a&gt; is a faith experiment, in which the goal is to post 1,000,000 stories of God's love and blessings.  

In doing so, each story on the witness wall will bless others, with the minimum $10 donation going towards humanitarian efforts such as water projects, feeding the hungry or rescuing kids from the diamond mines.   

We pose the question...Where is God, right here and right now?  We want to hear everything from miracles to everyday blessings.  We want to see people choose to buy a 4 foot pipe for a well instead of going to Chipotle for dinner.  God is near and he works through us to help those in need.

Do your part, we need you.  Go to &lt;a href="http://onemillionwitnesses.com"&gt;
Onemillionwitnesses.com&lt;/a&gt;, share your story and choose a mission to donate to.  If this project works, we really will change the world...One Story at a Time.

1. God does exist, here and now.
