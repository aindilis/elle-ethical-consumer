  <description>I'm taking the great Sensenbrenner's place whenever he steps down.  I'm a grassroots AMERICAN, and so what else do you need to know!?

By the way...I cannot run till like a billion years, so keep me in mind for the future, plus I'm just really bored right now!  But see- I'm even productive whenever I'm bored!

Vote 4 Me!

1. to clean up the streets, and make everyone united and one- because we are all Americans afterall!

2. to bring 'god' back- whether it's the christian one or another religion's view on the three letter word

3. to preserve the land, and keep it from being all developed</description>
