  <description>Spoke Folk is a 12-day biking and musical ministry tour for up to 30 participants (15-20 years old) and 10 adult counselors (21 and above). All these people are from different states all over the country. Each of the tours bikes during the day and shares an evening concert/worship service with each host congregation. Spoke Folk is very passionate about sharing and living the Gospel through biking, music, service and community.

1. The Gospel of Jesus is to be lived out in Christian Love and Fellowship.

2. Christian youth have an important role in the strengthening of Christian community.

3. Biking is an amazing way to build lasting friendships!</description>
