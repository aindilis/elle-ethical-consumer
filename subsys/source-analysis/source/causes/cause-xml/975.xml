  <description>Racism as you know is very popular amongst alot of different cultures, It's also the reason people fight with each other because they "Hate" the other race, from black on black from white on black and black to brown there is so much hate amongst us and we need to stop becasue if we do little's can stop getting hurt by getting teased by the color of their skin or if they're half white and half-black or any othere race then they get made fun of Im not sure you can donate any money towards this cause but if you want to then go ahead but just know that Racial Supiriority is a mere pigment of the Imagination.
