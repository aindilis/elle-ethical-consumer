  <description>St. Joseph, MO &#8211; With the cost of a transplant often exceeding $500,000, many transplant patients are unable to shoulder the financial burden of such a procedure.  The Children&#8217;s Organ Transplant Association (COTA) is a national charity dedicated to organizing and guiding communities in raising funds for transplant-needy patients.  In St. Joseph, volunteers are raising funds for transplant patients like local teen Dekoda Neill.  
      Born on November 12, 1993, Dekoda was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis, and doctors at St. Louis Children&#8217;s Hospital in Missouri recommended a life-saving double-lung transplant.  An estimated $65,000 is being raised by St. Joseph volunteers.
