  <description>The Hearts on a Sleeve &#169;2007 foundation is a charity organization devoted to helping orphans, teen mothers, and victims of domestic abuse through donations and design commissions.

As said by our co-founder, Dominique Zamora: 

"The idea behind the whole thing is this: Wearing your heart on your sleeve means showing you care. This is for those who have forgotten what that's like, those who have to be strong for themselves and their families. Sometimes people really can't afford to 'wear their hearts on their sleeves.' But maybe what they need most of all is someone who will."

Each shirt costs $12, with 70% of the profits going to charity and 30% to production.
