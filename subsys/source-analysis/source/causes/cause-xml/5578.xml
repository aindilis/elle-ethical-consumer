  <description>MALARIA FACTS:

- Malaria kills 1-3 million people annually.
- Deaths predominantly occur in children under five years of age and pregnant women.
- Approximately 90% of deaths occur in Africa.
- 500 million people per year get malaria. When people are sick with malaria they have a hard time working and drag down their caregivers/family members.
- People who die from malaria will never again have a birthday.

BIRTHDAY FACTS

- Almost all of us were born on a day.
- Many of us get birthday cards from friends.
- Many of us get birthday greetings and messages via the web and email.
- It is a time of joy and love.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY NETS 

- For your birthday ask your friends and family who would ordinarily buy you cards to buy a net instead.
 100% of the funds donated here are used to buy a long lasting net for $5.
