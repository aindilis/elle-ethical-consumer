  <description>There is a notion or in fact a revelation that has been had during Hillsong United's travels &#8211; that you cannot worship God without having an urge to carry out his will &#8211; to love people, to see His justice on earth. 

The I Heart Revolution therefore is a generation of people expressing their heart for worship &#8211; and realizing God&#8217;s purpose for all of us - to love people and be his hands and feet. This is not something new, however it is something that we have seen happening all over the world &#8211; we just gave it a name and want to be a part of it!

Please note: We are not encouraging people to donate through this site. You do however have to have a beneficiary.
