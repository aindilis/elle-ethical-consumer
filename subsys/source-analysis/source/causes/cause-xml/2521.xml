  <description>Why breastfeeding?

UNICEF stated (2005) that six million lives are saved each year as a result of exclusive breastfeeding. It provides lifelong benefits for both child and mother that cannot be replicated by artificial means. Human milk is uniquely suited to an infant's developmental needs and provides complete nutrition, increasing the survival rate of infants born around the world&#8212;especially in developing countries.

Breastfeeding also lowers a mother's risk of developing breast cancer throughout her life, according to the American Institute for Cancer Research.

Furthermore, it's environmentally sound and economically advantageous to the family and local economy because it reduces health care costs and conserves energy.

1. Mothering through breastfeeding is the most natural, effective way of satisfying a baby&#8217;s needs.

2. Mother and baby must be together early and often to establish a satisfying relationship and adequate milk supply.

3. In early years a baby has an intense need to be with mother, as basic as the need for food.

4. Breast milk is the superior infant food.

5. For the healthy, full-term baby, breast milk is the only food necessary until the baby shows signs of needing solids (~6 months).</description>
