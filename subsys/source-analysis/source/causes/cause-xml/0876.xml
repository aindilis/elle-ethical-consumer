The Matthew Shepard Foundation was founded by Dennis and Judy Shepard in memory of their 21-year old son, Matthew, who was murdered in an anti-gay hate crime in Wyoming in October 1998.   

Created to honor Matthew in a manner that was appropriate to his dreams, beliefs and aspirations, the Foundation seeks to "Replace Hate with Understanding, Compassion &amp; Acceptance" through its varied educational, outreach and advocacy programs and by continuing to tell Matthew's story. 

The Foundation focuses on three primary areas: Erasing Hate in our society, putting GLBT Youth First and ensuring Equality for all GLBT Americans.


1. OUR MISSION - To support diversity programs in education and to help youth organizations establish environments where young people can feel safe and be themselves. 

2. OUR VISION - To educate and enlighten others on the importance of diversity, understanding, compassion, acceptance and respect. Everyone must participate in developing solutions to problems that are rooted in ignorance and hatred.

3. OUR GOAL - To replace hate with understanding, compassion and acceptance.</description>
