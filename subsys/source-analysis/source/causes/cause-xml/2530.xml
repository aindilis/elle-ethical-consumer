  <description>Inspired by a traditional Argentine shoe and challenged by the continent's poverty and health issues, Tom's was created for a singular mission.

Tom's unique commitment is to match every pair purchased with a donated pair to a child in need...no complicated formulas...it's simple.  

The best way to give, as well as find out more info, is to go to www.tomsshoes.com.  For every pair of Tom's that you purchase, a child will be given a pair on your behalf.
