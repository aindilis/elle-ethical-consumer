  <description>My names Paige. I have been a type 1 diabetic for about 5 years now. In that time I have learnt ALL there is to know about the disease. It is not a pleasent one to have and what people don't know is that Diabetes can be prevented ... but only to an extent. If you concentrate on your intake of food and you exercise regularily, you can increase your chances of staying healthy up to about 20% more than if you dont care what you eat. What people dont know is that diabetes is the second most epic plague that the world is known to. Diabetes is a complicating disease, but with the rigth treatments, diabetes can be a liveable disease. It acually all relies on you. If you are willing to give it 100%, you can live a long healthy life, but if you dont care, your not helping yourself in anyway. So be smart, and make right choices!

1. Diabetes Affects People Everywhere in The World

2. Needs to come to an End.

3. Diabetes can happen to Anyone, Anytime. It needs to be cured</description>
