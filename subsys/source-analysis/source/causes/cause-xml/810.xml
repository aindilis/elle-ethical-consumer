  <description>Stand up!  If you are a Catholic, then you hope for peace in all aspects of life.  Peace in the hearts of your fellow man, peace of mind, but most importantly an end to global violence.  Let's join our voices and shout out against the atrocities that we see!

1. War must end.

2. Victims of war should be aided.

3. Troops should be protected by honoring them, and saving their lives. </description>
