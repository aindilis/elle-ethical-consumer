  <description>I, Bryan Justin, have Emery Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy [EDMD] and was diagnosed when I was about 11 years old.  It is one of the rarest forms of Muscular Dystrophy that exists today.  It is a less severe form, however, it is still a progressive neuromuscular disease that slowly wastes away the muscles, causing them to weaken.

Help in the fight against MD in donating money, by showing your support, or just by spreading the word about the disease.  Even you can help to find a cure.
