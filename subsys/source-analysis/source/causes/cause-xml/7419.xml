  <description>Mike Huckabee for President

Watch Mike Huckabee on the Daily Show: http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/index.jhtml?ml_video=80701

and on the Colbert Report: http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/index.jhtml?ml_video=63633


Mike Huckabee is running for the Republican nomination for President.  He is the former Governor of Arkansas and is from Hope, Arkansas which is coincidentally also where Pres. Bill Clintion grew up.  He is a Baptist minister who credits his Christian faith for his diligent work to help victims of the Katrina disaster.  

Huckabee is fiscally conservative and a strong supporter of the Fair Tax.  He belives that all life is imporant and sacred whether that life be in the womb, a child in school, or a person needing decent healthcare, and that as a society we should treat all human life with dignity and respect.  

Don't settle for a candidate who's not a real conservative!  Don't settle for a candidate who has a ton of political baggage!  Don't settle for a candidate with no charisma!  Let's breathe some life back into the Republican party with a candidate who stands by his values and fights for conservative ideals.

Mike Huckabee for President!
