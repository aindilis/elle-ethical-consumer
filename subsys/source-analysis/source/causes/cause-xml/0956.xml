  <description>Founded in 1984 after the tragic death of Charlie Howard, a 23-year old Bangor man who was murdered simply because he was gay, EqualityMaine effectively lobbies the State Legislature, provides campaign support to candidates for elected office, and works to educate the public on a wide array of topics affecting the LGBT community, including workplace, family and discrimination issues. Over the last two decades, EqualityMaine has worked to secure civil rights legislation, pass hate crimes protection laws, promote workplace equality, and ensure sound and responsible HIV/AIDS policies.</description>
