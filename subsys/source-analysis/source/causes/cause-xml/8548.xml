  <description>As you read this, hundreds of mice, rats, cats, dogs, birds, rabbits, monkeys, and other animals are dying in cruel and unnecessary medical and product-testing experiments. In fact, 219 animals are killed every minute in a U.S. lab. They die in pain, alone, without a gentle touch or a soothing voice. Animal studies teach us nothing about the health of humans because animals of different species absorb, metabolize, and eliminate substances differently than humans do. The truth is that testing on animals is bad science: It is unreliable and unnecessary.





1. Animals are not a reliable source on which to base scientific results.

2. Animals deserve compassion.

3. We can definately decrease the amount of animal testing by changing food, medicine and other brands that we purchase.</description>
