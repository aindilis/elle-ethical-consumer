  <description>Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are inflammatory bowel diseases that are characterized by inflamation of the gastrointestinal tracts (anywhere for Crohn's and specifically the colon for people with colitis).  The main gastrointestinal symptoms are abdominal pain and weight loss.While ulcerative colitis is curable through the removal of part of all of a patients colon, Crohn's is not. Instead, a number of medical treatments are utilized with the goal of putting and keeping the disease in remission. These include steroid medications &amp; immunomodulators. Crohn's disease affects between 400,000 and 600,000 people in North America. Although the cause of Crohn's disease is not known, it is widely believed to be an autoimmune disease. Crohn's disease often develops in the teenage years, though individuals in their 60s and 70s are also at increased risk. Ulcerative colitis is a rare disease, with an incidence of about one person per 10,000 in North America. There is no known cause for these two diseases though it is thought to be genetic.
