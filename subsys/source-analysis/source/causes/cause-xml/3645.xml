If you haven't already, check this website out!
It is by far the most artistic website I've seen, as well as most influential. The books are great too! To me, this website promotes such an intense amount of compassion, it's too hard to ignore. Maybe you'll feel the same? 

To send in a postcard, simply make a 4x6 postcard out of of whatever [mine was cardboard, but poster paper or photographs work too], write your secret down, and send it to:

PostSecret
13345 Copper Ridge Rd.
Germantown, Maryland
USA 20874-3454

New secrets are posted every Sunday on the site, so check it out!
