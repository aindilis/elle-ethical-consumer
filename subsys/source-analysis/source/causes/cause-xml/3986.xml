  <description>Becoming a Jedi requires the most profound commitment and astute mind, as Jedi instruction is rigidly structured and codified to enforce discipline and hinder transgression. The Jedi are keepers of the peace of an ancient and noble monastic organization, known for their talent in and observance of The Force. Using the living things around them to manipulate the Force and wielding their signature lightsabers, members of the Jedi Order fought for peace and justice in the Galactic Republic for between 20 000- 25 000 years prior to the Battle of Yavin. Their philosophical rivals and opposites are the Sith.


    There is no emotion; there is peace.
    There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.
    There is no passion; there is serenity.
    There is no death; there is the Force.

1. Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.

2. Jedi use their powers to defend and protect, never to attack others.

3. Jedi respect all life, in any form.

4. Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.

5. Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.</description>
