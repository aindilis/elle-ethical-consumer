  <description>I (Jamie O'Brien) am planning on riding my bicycle across the US next summer for PUSH america. PUSH America is a national philanthropy started by Pi Kappa Phi fraternity to raise money and awareness for people with disabilities. I am planning on doing a bike ride called the Journey of Hope, which will start in San Fransisco, Cali. and end in Washington D.C. This trip will take us about 63 days to complete. Before I can make this ride I must raise $5,000 dollars as my donation to PUSH America. This is a ride I have been planning on doing for 4 years but have never been able to do. With your help I can make this dream come true.

1. People with disabilities are still people and should be treated with the respect they deserve!</description>
