  <description>Our international reputation as a healing center for children from birth to age 21 was created by the compassionate people and doctors who have touched so many lives through these many years. From classroom-based programs to sophisticated laboratory research, no other organization comes close to providing the state-of-the-art equipment, array of pediatric specialists and all-inclusive care that makes Le Bonheur such a valuable regional resource. Parents seek out our special brand of care for their children, routinely traveling from more than 95 counties in six states.

Le Bonheur is currently raising $100 million dollars to build a state-of-the-art facility.  The hospital will be a 12-story tower with over 1 million square feet of space to serve more than 130,000 children each year.
