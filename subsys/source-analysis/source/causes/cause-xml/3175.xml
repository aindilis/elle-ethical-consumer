  <description> Stop the Violence against Latinas is a group that not only Latinas can join but anyone from any race. The abuse of women not only in the U.S. but globally is increasing. No one has the right to hurt you emotionally, mentally, physically or in any other way. Joining this group is just simply saying that your against the abuse of Latin women or of any women. There is no obligation if you choose to read this and still decide that "Hey this group is just not for me," then that&#8217;s your choice but if at any moment while reading this you've agreed with something that was said join this group. Nothing is required of you...This is just another way to lend a helping hand to the VOICE against the abuse of women.

                       Cu&#237;date mi gente.

1. Abuse is wrong in any case.

2. If you&#8217;re being abused don&#8217;t keep quiet tell someone that you can trust and will help you

3. It&#8217;s not your fault. If someone is hurting you there is something wrong with them not you.</description>
