  <description>No national or international medical association recommends routine circumcision.

Only the USA circumcises the majority of newborn boys without medical or religious reason.

Circumcision began during the 1800s to prevent masturbation, which was believed to cause disease.

Today's parents are learning that the foreskin is a normal, protective, functioning organ.

Today's parents realize circumcision has risks and is unnecessary. 

Circumcision denies a male's right to genital integrity and choice for his own body.

1. Breach of bodily integrity

2. Breach of human rights

3. Because it aint broke: don't fix it</description>
