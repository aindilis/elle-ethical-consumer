  <description>After the Hosti v Carter decision stemming from an incident at Govenor's State University, college newspaper's and other publications were deemed to be independent of school censorship only if they were 1. Wholy student run and 2. An independent public forum, not part of an acedemic experence.

In reaction to this ruling the Illinois House and Senate passed the Illinois College Free Press Act which would designate all college publications an independent public forum and in so doing protect them from censorship by university administrators who might not like a story. 

The bill is now on Gov. Blagojevich's desk to be signed or vetoed. Please call the govenor's office and urge him to sign this important piece of legislation. 

1. The college press must be able to work freely with out threat of censorship </description>
