  <description>We believe the war on drugs is doing more harm than good.  In our vision of tomorrow, people are not punished simply for what they put into their bodies but only for harm done to others.  We fight for drug policies based on science, compassion, health and human rights.

1. Marijuana use should not be criminalized.

2. Drug problems should be addressed by treatment, not the criminal justice system.

3. Drug education should be based on reality and not scare tactics.</description>
