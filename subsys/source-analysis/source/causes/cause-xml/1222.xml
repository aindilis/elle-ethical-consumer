  <description>Endometriosis is a reproductive and immunological illness affecting millions of women and girls around the world.  Mistakenly stigmatized as merely painful periods, Endometriosis is far more than just "killer cramps".  The far-reaching effects of this Endometriosis can negatively impact all of society.  The ERC strives to make a positive difference in the lives of all those affected by the disease.
