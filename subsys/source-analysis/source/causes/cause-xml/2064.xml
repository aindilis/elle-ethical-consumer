  <description>We have all suffered through Westminster School's annoying teachers and strict rules of living. They always taught us that we should give back to the community and this is the way we can give back. Please donate money to pay for tution of new students to go to new schools. Pay Flint Hill so they can accept potential Westminster students that can go there free.


Note: This cause doesn't care if you donate money or not. In fact, it would be easier if you DIDN'T donate money because Flint Hill doesn't need the money anyway. But if you feel the need, go ahead.

1. Westminster School is torture to kids.

2. The Westminster way of teaching must be stopped.

3. Children should not be educated and raised this way.</description>
