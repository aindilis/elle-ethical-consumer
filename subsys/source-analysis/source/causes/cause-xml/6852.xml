  <description>The pro-progress cause was founded to stop people like hippies. We want to keep abortion legal in order to cleanse the world for genetic deformities and problems, keep animal testing strong for medical and scientific research (no makeup or crap like that research) and of course to support social darwinism (like capitalism) - if you don't have skills, you starve. That's life. Equal opportunities, but only those with brains survive.

The picture is taken by Maddox, its his right to use it, but I'm sure he'd support this cause!

1. Keep abortion legal.

2. Support animal testing.

3. Support Social Darwinism</description>
