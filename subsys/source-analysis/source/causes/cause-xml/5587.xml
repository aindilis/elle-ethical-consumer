  <description>Founded in 1957, Friends of Animals (&#8220;FoA&#8221;)
is a non-profit organization working to
cultivate respect for the interests of all animals in living on their own terms. FoA has active members throughout North America and beyond.

From its beginning in 1957, FoA has facilitated
low-cost altering to prevent births of domestic
dogs and cats and, in turn, to prevent shelter
killings. Every autumn, we launch a fresh
and dynamic campaign to encourage people
to pass up fur garments and build a peaceful
wardrobe. Concurrent with our anti-hunting
campaigns, we publish up-to-date, practical
guides to explain the tremendous benefits of,
and facilitate adjustment to, a pure vegetarian
diet.

We work to transcend the traditional
conservation perspective which sees animals
as either resources or predators to be
controlled rather than beings with inherent
and individual worth. And because we
envision a society capable of transcending the
paradigm in which controlling groups terrorize
vulnerable groups, we know that meaningful
change must come through peaceful action.
