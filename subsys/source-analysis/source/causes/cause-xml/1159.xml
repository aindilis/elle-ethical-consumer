  <description>"To provide a better life for Thoroughbreds, both during and after their racing careers by supporting retirement, rescue and research and by helping the people who work with them."

This mission guides us to aid other non-profits

TCA is a fund raising organization which follows a "United Way" methodology, by providing the Thoroughbred Industry and supporters a way to give to one entity which then distributes annual grants to hundreds of non-profits within our mission.

1. Thoroughbred rescue, rehabilitation and retraining for secondary careers post-racetrack

2. Equine educational organizations including those who provide equine-based scholarships and those who utilize Thoroughbreds in their educational programs

3. Therapeutic riding programs which include the use of Thoroughbreds in their programs</description>
