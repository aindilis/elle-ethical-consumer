  <description>This is a place were everyone who has felt like they've been misunderstood. Everyone who has felt like they don't belong, and that they won't measure up to what everyone says that they should be. 

This is a place were we can fight all the messeges that we get from the media, and our soceity. We don't have to take in everything that we hear. We can stand and say that we're different, and we don't have to fit the mold.

Here we eliminate all prejudice and discrimination and see each person for what they are, not what they look like.



1. Everyone is a person.

2. Acceptance.

3. Understanding.</description>
