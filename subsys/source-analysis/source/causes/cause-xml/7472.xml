  <description>2010 will mark the turning point to the 
world&#8217;s promise of ending extreme poverty 
that was established 5 years before at 
Gleneagles. Canada will be front and center 
on the world stage not just for the Winter 
Olympics in Vancouver, but because it&#8217;s 
Canada&#8217;s turn to host the G8 Summit in a 
location that is yet to be announced.

Ironically Canada is the only country 
among the developed world with a 
surplus. Governments in developed 
countries have the responsibility to 
commit to .7% of their GDP to the 
developing world. And yet time and 
time again it has given the thumbs 
down by critics and politicians that 
governments are not doing enough. 
Bob Geldof said profoundly on Canada&#8217;s 
contribution at this year&#8217;s G8 Summit in 
Germany, "A man called Stephen Harper 
came to Heiligendamm...but Canada 
stayed at home.&#8221;

G8 Make Promises Happen is global movement 
to organize events and initiatives leading 
up the meetings in 2010, to engage the 
public on the issue of extreme poverty, 
AIDS, and climate change specifically in 
Africa, and to let the G8 leaders (Canada, 
US, UK, Italy, Germany, France, Japan, 
Russia), their invited leaders (Brazil, 
China, South Africa, Mexico, India), and 
all international organizations renew their 
commitments to the following: 



1. MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS 

2. ENDING DISEASE - HIV/AIDS, TB, MALARIA 

3. MORE BETTER AID 

4. EDUCATION FOR ALL
