  <description>Look, Minimum wage basically creates fewer jobs; more unemployment. If a company can hire unskilled laborers who are willing to work for $3 an hour, and suddenly, minimum wage requires $6 an hour, do you think they're going to pay twice as much to that guy for $6 an hour? NO! They're going to lay him off and find a skilled laborer and keep him down with $6 an hour. Ultimately, they'll lay off more and more people to keep profits until the remaining laborers are creating income by increasing productivity, but that leaves many more people out of work AKA UNEMPLOYED. It may appear that raising the minimum wage increases standard of living, but only for the people in work. Everyone else gets laid off or not even hired, and unemployment soars. 

1. Minimum wage creates unemployment. 

2. The market will decide wages for people that want to work.

3. If people are willing to work for low wages, why woudn't you let them?</description>
