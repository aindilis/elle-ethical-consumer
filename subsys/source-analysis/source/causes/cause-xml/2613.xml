  <description>The IFOPA is a nonprofit organization committed to creating a future without FOP.  This organization supports families dealing with a rare genetic condition known as Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP). Simply stated, FOP causes muscles and other connective tissue to turn into bone, eventually causing immobility as FOP bone fuses joints.
