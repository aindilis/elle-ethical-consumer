  <description>This isn't a religion, this isn't atheists for the end of faith. This is my simple view that I must share.
Religion kills people, so end it. This is a personal decision that should be based around families, not countries, enemies, and differences. They all have glaring similiarities, why not focus on those instead?

1. End organized religion

2. A world without war

3. Make this a personal decision only</description>
