  <description>Quebec, ever since the Confederation, was a Canadian province. The Quebequois are French CANADIANS, in fact, they were the first to be called Canadian. The distant heritage does not matter, we should live together in peace and harmony instead of complaining about our different languages or cultures. For any territory to seperate from its country is stupid, because unity strenghens and seperation weakens from both an economical and political point of view, as history has demonstated many times. 
Less French Canadiens want Quebec to seperate now, but as time goes, the idea might revive. People must understand that cultural and liguistic differences are not a reason for seperating.  

1. Quebec must remain part of Canada.

2. The seperatist movement in Quebec must cease to exist.</description>
