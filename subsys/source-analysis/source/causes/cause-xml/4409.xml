  <description>TOPSoccer(The Outreach Program for Soccer) is a nonprofit program that allows kids with mental and physical disabilities to join in on the most widely played and well known sport in the world, soccer.  To participate in this cause it takes no money, just a little bit of your time and a ball and you can include some kids in a sport, team, and group of friends that would otherwise not be available to them.

Just a simple weekly scrimmage on the weekends and/or an easy practice during the week is all that is needed.

1. Soccer, the sport for ALL not just the "able!"</description>
