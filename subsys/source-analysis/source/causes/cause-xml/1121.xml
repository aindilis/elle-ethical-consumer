  <description>We proclaim Jesus Christ and promote communities of joy, hope, love, and peace.

Our mission is about sharing the peace of Jesus Christ in all its dimensions. &#8220;The peace of Jesus Christ&#8221; encompasses all of the promises, hopes, and blessings of the gospel as revealed by Christ and as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, his promised presence with us. 

Worldwide, each of our congregations is a warm, participative community where we respect&#8212;and use&#8212;the gifts and talents of each person, from oldest to youngest in celebration of our mission. 

In neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, and organizations, we share the peace of Jesus Christ by caring for each other, for all people, and for the earth itself.
