  <description>The New Voters Project is a non-profit, non-partisan, grassroots voter mobilization project that works to turn 18-24 year olds out to vote.  Since 2003, the New Voters Project has registered over 650,000 young voters and made over 600,000 get-out-the-vote reminders.  Support the New Voters Project, and help us turn out the youth vote in 2008!

1. Voting is vital to the health of our democracy.

2. Young people will vote if politicians talk to them about the issues they care about.

3. Young voters will turn out to vote if urged to do so by their peers.</description>
