  <description>Every year school starts earlier and ends later. This is a  cause for all those that wish to stand up and say they want their summer break to be as long as it used to be. Our view is when people want to go to school they preform better and burned out students are not happy students.

1. Summer break should not start earlier than August 15th(unless on "year round" schedule)

2. School ALWAYS end before Memorial Day.

3. Our breaks should not be cut as a result.</description>
  <mission>keep our summer breaks from continuing to get cut short.</mission>
