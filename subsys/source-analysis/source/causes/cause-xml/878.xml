  <description>The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity was established by Elie Wiesel and his wife, Marion, shortly after he was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize for Peace. The Foundation's mission, rooted in the memory of the Holocaust, is to advance the cause of human rights by creating forums for the discussion and resolution of urgent ethical issues. Through all its activities, the Foundation seeks to combat indifference, intolerance and injustice.
