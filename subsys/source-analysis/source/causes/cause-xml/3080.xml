  <description>love.f&#250;tbol is a 501(c)3 social-profit organization that empowers underserved communities to build simple soccer fields where at-risk youth have no safe place to play.  

We envision a day when all children have a safe place to fulfill their passion for soccer. The game provides hope, inspiration and is a platform for personal and community development.

love.f&#250;tbol engages, mobilizes and empowers communities to build their own soccer fields. We finance raw materials, provide guidance and ultimately serve as a catalyst; locals donate land and labor, and plan and execute their own project. The success of our work is dependent on the community.

Since 2006, love.f&#250;tbol has catalyzed seven community-driven soccer field projects that currently serve thousands of children throughout Guatemala. In each case, locals have been of a distinct language and culture.

love.f&#250;tbol will be significantly expanding operations in 2011. We anticipate further expansion throughout Central and South America, and expect to be operational in Honduras and Brazil by 2012 for the 2014 World Cup.
