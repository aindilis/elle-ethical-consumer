  <description>Call your radio station up and tell them to stop the audio blood fest!  Aren't you sick of liking a song alot, and then hating it after you hear it 10 times a day?

Also, donate your riches to a very awesome ministry!

1. The same song can't be played more than once per day/3 times per week.

2. The song must be played at alternating times of the day when played more than once per week.

3. Stations who violate this should be fined heavily among other things.</description>
