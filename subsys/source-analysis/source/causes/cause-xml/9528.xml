  <description>The Rams Club - also known as the Educational Foundation - is an organization of more than 13,000 members who are committed to supporting Carolina's student athletes with their gifts to the athletics scholarships program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

UNC sponsors a broad-based program, proudly enjoying tremendous success in each of its 28 varsity sports. Among the achievements are 32 team national championships, 50 individual national championships and numerous All America and All-Conference performers. To achieve this degree of success requires incredible commitment from the more than 450 student athletes receiving financial assistance while representing Carolina. It also requires a high level of support from the Carolina faithful.

In addition to raising scholarship funds, the Rams Club also spearheads efforts for capital projects and other select initiatives.
