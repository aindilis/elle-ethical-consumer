  <description>According to the RIAA, the music industry has seen a steady decrease in sales over the last five years or so. It is crucial for every musician, whether up-and-coming or a veteran, to support the legal downloading of songs. The acquisition of music should always be legal. Even if you're not a musician, help out by purchasing your music legally through a variety of websites and programs. Or support your local CD store and buy one there. Allow musicians to be compensated fairly for their work.

1. Music downloading should always be legal.

2. Musicians deserve fair compensation for their music.

3. Downloading music fairly would help to improve the declining state of the music industry.</description>
