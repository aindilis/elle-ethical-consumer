  <description>We must find a way to eliminate all the unnecessary emitions in the atmosphere within a 10 year span, or we are never going to be able to save our environment. Thats right, there will not be able to reverse the damage that we have caused. 

If every American and Canadian would change just one light bulb with an eco friendly bulb, it would be the equivalent if 950,000 cars off the roads. 

Recycling all cardboards, glass, aluminum cans, paint cans, etc. 

Use reusable bags when shopping,do not use plastic bags, they do not decompose, and their oils get back into our water systems.

Dont use paper bags either, they do decompose, but destroy rainforest's in Canada and worldwide.

Use eco friendly cleaning products.

Unplug all electronic equipment when not in use. Even though they are off, they are still using a huge amount of electricity. 75% of your electronics life is when you are not even using it. 

Take public transit, or carpool to work, school, events. There is no reason to clog out streets/freeways with cars.

Fight for transportation to go by freight train, not transport, or plane. Trains use the same amount of gas/diesel, but carry triple the amount of freight.

Do not fly! Airplanes emit in one cross planet trip in emitions that a automobile does in 86 years.
