  <description>Seedlings Braille Books for Children was founded in 1984 by Debra Bonde because braille materials for children were scarce and expensive. Her goals were to increase the availability and lower the cost of braille books for children in order to promote their literacy skills and the love of reading. Seedlings' ongoing goal is to increase the rate of braille literacy by ensuring blind children access to many of the the same books that their sighted peers enjoy. By making popular children's books available and affordable in braille, Seedlings offers visually impaired children equal opportunity to develop their literacy skills, and the tools to become lifelong readers and literate adults.
