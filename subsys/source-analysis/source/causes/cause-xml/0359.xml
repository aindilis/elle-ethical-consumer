  <description>Libertarians believe in, and pursue, personal freedom while maintaining personal responsibility.  The Libertarian Party itself serves a much larger pro-liberty community with the specific mission of electing Libertarians to public office.
 
Libertarians strongly oppose any government interfering in their personal, family and business decisions.   Essentially, we believe all Americans should be free to live their lives and pursue their interests as they see fit as long as they do no harm to another.
 
In a nutshell, we are advocates for a smaller government, lower taxes and more freedom.

Socialists and proto-socialists within BOTH major political parties are desperate to increase government involvement in your life. They hope  to increase government spending, control and power so that they can rule you more completely. Socialized healthcare will be a major platform in the 2008 election and it must  be stopped.

1. Gain widespread support for social and economic liberty

2. Fight the growing threat of socialism in today's politics

3. Return the freedoms that the country was founded on to the American People.</description>
