  <description>The reality is .. people die. Parents though, are not supposed to burry their children. 
Life after Death is a cause that is looking to raise money for services to help with the transition of the death of a child. Be it a death of an unborn child or the death of a grown child. 
More often than not, parents find themselves in a world of hurt not knowing what to do or how to live. 
I am hoping with the help of Life after Death , I can help ease the pain of such a loss. 
The main focus of this cause is to raise money for services that will take place in the hospital. 
So that these parents are attended to immediately. 
After the fact donations will be spread into services of councelling to these bereaved parent(s) and/or guardian(s)/family member(s)/friend(s).

1. No parent should ever have to burry their children.

2. Everyone has the right to aid no matter what their circumstance(s). </description>
