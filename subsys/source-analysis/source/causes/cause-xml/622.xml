  <description>So yeah, after being wrongfully persecuted by my own religion for many years (Christianity), I've decided to leave my religion and start a movement to stop religious fundamentalism. Victims of religious indoctrination are welcome, as well as those who have been wronged by a church member or leader.

My personal focus is Christianity, because for a lot of people claiming to be good and holy, they only say this for the purpose of putting others down and to shove their views down our throats. The United States President is a very good example of religious fundamentalism, as most of you all know.

MAJOR UPDATE:

Religious fundamentalism destroys a girl's hopes and dreams to go to college on an athletic scholarship, all because she is atheist.

1. Religious fundamentalism is wrong, hateful, and illogical.

2. Religious fundamentalism alienates moderates.

3. Religious fundamentalism has no positives. Fundamentalist Islam advocates killing others, whereas Christianity enforces a "shut-out" feeling.</description>
