The Story Behind Our Name:  
In 2000 Jake Collins, the founder and executive director of Tiny Stars, was working in a South American orphanage when the woman 
running the orphanage broke down and shared her frustrations and fears.  Jake encouraged her with "The Starfish Story" to show 
reinforce the importance of her work.   Shortly after returning to the United States in 2000, he named Tiny Stars after "The Starfish 
Story" to fight child trafficking and remove predators from the streets.
