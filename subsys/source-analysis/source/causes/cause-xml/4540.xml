  <description>14 year-olds are old enough to work. How are they expected to get to their jobs? Should they rely on their parents every day? What happens if they have no ride? They get fired. 

People have to wait until they are 16 in Massachusetts just to get their permit! Then you have 6 months of "training" for your liscense. When you're 16 and a half, then you get your semi-liscense. So basically, you can't really drive until you are 17. Then you can drive yourself to work, and maybe carpool with a friend that's 17. 

Don't you think this is a little old? 23 of our 50 states have the permit age set to 15. 2 states have the permit age at 14!. Why can't massachusetts be like that? The current ruling is unfair, and this cause is meant to change that.

1. The Massachusetts driving age must be lowered.

2. The restrictions for beginning drivers must be limited.

3. The penalties for driving with a friend when under 17 must be less harsh.</description>
