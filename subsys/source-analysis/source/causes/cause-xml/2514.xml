  <description>I have decided to start this because on one person who really opened my eyes to this.  Yes, it may sound corny, but you know the runner up on American Idol? Blake Lewis? 

Well, he and his friends over at blakergirls.com give back to the Seattle Children's Hospital.  It made me realize all the children who are sick. 

So, this cause is to help all children.

That is a link to an amazon wish list.  The link goes straight to the Seattle one, but if you scroll down a bit on the left side there are so many other children's hospitals.  It is to buy a toy for a child over there.  I have bought a toy, and it makes you feel all happy inside. :-)

Do what you can if you want.  Just wanted to spread the word.
