  <description>whether u grew up with the greats (Nas, Jay-Z, Rakim, Run-D.M.C.,Biggie,Pac, ATCQ, DeLa etc.) or you're just fed-up with all the crap that sounds the same on the radio

1. Hip-hop is the people's voice!

2. Sure sales are good, but isn't quality better than quantity?

3. Remember J-Kwon? (thats what i thought)

4. what!? lil' wayne DIDN'T write the carter 1?

5. its the whole "lets use the same beat for a billion songs" thing that annoys us

6. "a bay bay" and such ISN'T i repeat ISN'T hip-hop, its club/rap/pop music... nuff said

7. so yea, kanye proved that "hip-hop" still has a chance against such a mainstream artist as 50 pence

8. come on people give us more positions?!!?!??!</description>
