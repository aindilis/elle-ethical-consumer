  <description>Aortic dissection is commonly misdiagnosed and therefore undetected. If not diagnosed and surgically repaired quickly, it is almost always fatal. 
Symptoms are similar to heart attack: chest pain, ripping/tearing sensation, numbness in arms/legs, clammy feeling, enlarged heart, high blood pressure (which could also be a cause).


1. Health professionals must be better educated about the condition.

2. Health professionals should not rule out a diagnosis based on the patient's age.

3. Patients must be proactive and demand a CT scan if other diagnoses have been ruled out. </description>
