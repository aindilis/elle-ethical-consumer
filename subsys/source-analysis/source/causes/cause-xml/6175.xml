  <description>New Sudan Education Initiative (NESEI) is an international non-profit organization with offices in Burlington, Vermont; Knoxville, Tennessee; and South Sudan. 

We have 4 main strategies for developing young leaders:

1) Make quality secondary education accessible and affordable through tuition sponsorship, work-study and teacher support.

2) Ensure students&#8217; physical and mental health by providing preventative care and health education.

3) Put students on the fast-track to success in a difficult post-conflict society through practical school-to-work, entrepreneurial and leadership skill-building enrichment.

4) Provide graduating NESEI students with post-secondary opportunities such as microfinance and scholarships for university studies.

Please visit our website, www.nesei.org, for more information about us and how you can get involved with NESEI's important work.
