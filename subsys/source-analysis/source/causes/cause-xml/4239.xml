  <description>Everyone would agree that the world would be a better place without hippies, the exceedingly obese, Michael Moore, homosexuals and drug users.  Now you might say that my previous statement wouldn't be true because the people I listed would disagree; this couldn't be further from the truth, they aren't really people.  Now that we've gotten past the stage of dehumanizing these foul creatures we have to take the next step and do our part in getting rid of them.  For example if a crack addict approaches you on the street and asks you if you are selling, go out of your way to buy some kind of industrial cleaner to sell back to him so he ends up ending his own life.  Ostracizing these people is also an effective (albeit less effective than the previous alternative) route to dealing with the problem.  Do your part, make the lives of hippies harder by throwing litter at them, throw rocks at homeless crack heads and remember to get your dogs and cats spayed or neutered.

1. Degenerates must be dealt with harshly.

2. Hot pockets are unfit for eating.

3. Strawberry shortcake = fun4everyone.</description>
