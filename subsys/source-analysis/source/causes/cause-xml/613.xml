  <description>Technology lacks free will and creative thinking, while organics such as ourselves lack a certain accuracy and precision that could help us carry out complicated tasks. 

Fusing ourselves with machines will also help us in the long term, when the Earth becomes inevitably overpopulated, endangered by some sort of natural or man-made disaster, or even in the longer term when the sun explodes, the Andromedia Galaxy comes hurtling towards us, etc. Colonizing and exploring the final frontier will be humanity's only option, and technobiological symbioticism will get us there. 

Governmental, military, and international organizations need to revise their objectives. Peacekeeping and national security are unreachable goals and any progress in sustaining them is but a Band-Aid over a more serious issue - the preservation and evolution of mankind as a whole. The obvious solution is, but of course, to preserve our legacy as long as possible and we do so by making it possible to colonize space. 

1. to prolong our existance, we must colonize space

2. artificial intellegence and cyborgs will present no threat

3. man is no longer the dominant species - machines are our most precious assets

4. people can't survive in space, machines can</description>
