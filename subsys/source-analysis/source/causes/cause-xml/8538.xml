  <description>Camp South Africa began in 2002, and occurs every November and December.  It has grown to the point where hundreds of children each year are able to take part in CSA.  

During our daycamps, children are provided with food, games, crafts, singing, and a message.

Our week-long camps provide much of the same on a greater scale.
