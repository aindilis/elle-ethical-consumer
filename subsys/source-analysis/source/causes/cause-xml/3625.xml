  <description>Think of all the problems in the world, in the city or town where you live, on your own block: pollution, violence, children who can't read, housebound elderly people, litter in the street, the homeless. If only somebody would do something about these things. . . . Why not you? Why not now?

&#8220;When we wake up in the morning, so often our first thought is some variation of &#8220;What about me?&#8217;  If this thought drives our lives, fear and self-absorption rule us.  We are so fixated on our own happiness that our mind begins to shrink, and with it, the possibility of happiness.


What would real happiness be?  It would be egolessness, the lack of struggle, and a fundamental joy and sense of celebration, not only in our own happiness but also in the happiness of others.


Considering others is the basis of any spiritual and worldly success, if we define success as having a fulfilled, meaningful, and permanently happy mind.  If we help others, we will all find the happiness we want &amp; hand in hand we can make this world actually a better place.&#8221;
