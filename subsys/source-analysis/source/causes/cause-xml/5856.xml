  <description>Hundreds of thousands of dogs suffer in puppy mills in this country. The dogs are prisoners of greed. They are locked in small cages. They freeze in the winter and swelter in the summer. The dogs never get out of their prisons. They are bred over and over again until they die. The only way to free them from the misery of these horrid puppymills is to eliminate the demand for puppies by refusing to buy a puppy in a pet store and boycotting those pet stores that sell puppies. When people stop buying puppies in pet stores, the puppy mills will go out of business and the misery will end. The state and federal governments do not enforce the laws to protect the dogs. The commercial breeders and brokers have huge well-funded lobbying efforts. Please join this fight to free the prisoners of greed. The only person who is going to make a difference for the dogs suffering in puppy mills is you. You, the people, can free them from their puppy mill prisons.

1. Dogs ARE dying from being overbred.

2. This is happening everywhere across America...sometimes in places that people do not even recognize. 

3. Dogs should NOT be bred every time they go into heat.

4. Most dogs sold in pet stores are bred in puppy mills and will face later health complications.

5. Dogs should not be bred until they are on their third or fourth cycle...a puppy having puppies is dangerous!

6. Dogs should not be bred with their parents, sibilings, or puppies.</description>
