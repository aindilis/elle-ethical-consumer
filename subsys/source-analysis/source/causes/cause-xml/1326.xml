  <description>For over 80 years, Planned Parenthood of the Rochester/Syracuse Region (PPRSR) has helped Central and Western New Yorkers take control of their sexual health.

We cover a 10-county area in NY with offices in Albion, Batavia, Brockport, Canadaigua, Greece, Newark, Rochester, and Syracuse.

We provide 1000's of people with reproductive health care.  We teach healthy sexuality in schools and communities.  We fight for reproductive rights in NY and around the world.

But we know our work isn't done. In truth, it may have just begun.  Join us in the fight to save choice by supporting PPRSR!

1. Every person has the right to make voluntary, informed choices about their own body.

2. Age-appropriate, medically accurate, comprehensive sex ed should be taught in schools.

3. Keep abortion safe and legal.

4. Women's health and safety must be protected.

5. Family planning and real sex ed are key to reducing unintended pregnancy and STI's.

6. All people should have the right to affordable, accessable, safe sexual health care.</description>
