  <description>THANK YOU TO THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE FOR CHANGE DONATIONS:
Amanda Macqueen, Bree Ridley, Julie Gould, Russ Edwards, Kinsey Heath, Allison Temnick, Houston Friend, Brian Jones and Family, Laura Herrod, JT Himmelstein, Jake Fenton, Jim Crowell

IN ONLY 6 DAYS WE REACHED OUR GOAL OF $400 in CHANGE!

We blessed Pastor David with the money on Tuesday and he was overjoyed! Thank you for all of your willingness to help :) 

IF YOU HAVE have been able to donate yet and you are willing to, please do not refrain from contacting us! We have a new cause that we are going to support, a church that is right off of Van Buren and ministers to people in the intercity. We would love to raise $400 for this cause as well. 

ALSO, this site will soon be changed to "BE A BLESSING" and we will have many different ways to volunteer, other than simply donating. We will have service projects that will allow us to bless others together and serve God in that way.

1. We ought to extend the hands of Christ.

2. This cause is co-founded by Kinsey Heath </description>
