  <description>I am running the Chicago Marathon for Team Asha.
When I heard about Team Asha, I realized how fortunate I am that my parents provided me with the education that is allowing me to help others and gain personal satisfaction. My father is from India and I have extensively toured the country and have been immersed in it's culture all my life. I have seen the socioeconomic situation there and I believe every child in every country should have the opportunities I have been given. It is an amazing feeling that my training and the marathon I will run will not only make me a better person, but give others the chance to make themselves better as well. I also hope that my fundraising will spread the word about Team Asha and promote its message.


1. Everyone should have access to education. Its not a right, its a necessity to live.</description>
