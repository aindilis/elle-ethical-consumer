  <description>This cause is to raise money for the Young Oncology Unit at Christie Hospital.

If you donate through here money will go to the American Cancer Society Summer Camp for children and young people with cancer.

To donate directly to the Young Oncology Unit send me a message.

1. All teenagers with cancer must have access to a dedicated teenage ward.

2. The Young Oncology Unit should have enough money to operate social activities for all patients past and present.

3. Teenage Cancer should be more well known and appear in the consicousness of all people.</description>
