  <description>All of this care-bear and sunshine "Save Darfur" crap has got to go. It doesn't take a coalition of people from around the world to save a people. All it takes is a couple of well placed cruise missles and a small force to clean up the mess afterwards. Until the world wakes up and realizes that some people just have to be killed, crap like this is going to continue to happen. 

1. There is immeasuably tragic genocide being caried out against the nonmuslim black population of Sudan, located in the Darfur region. 

2. These people are motivated by hate and prejudice, and will continue to kill until they kill all of the Sudanese not aligned with them or they themselves are killed.

3. The people of Darfur don't need UN or African Union Peacekeepers, they need a NATO force to go in and start clearing house. 

4. It shouldn't matter that Sudan is an exporter of oil; if they argue, after we are done, we can take their oil if they complain. </description>
  <mission>Recognize that the only way to bring peace to some regions of the world, including Darfur, is to kill with extreme prejudice the people carrying out the genocide.</mission>
