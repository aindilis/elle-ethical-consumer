  <description>The essential emotional and social needs of those living with cancer have driven rapid Gilda's Club expansion in the last eleven years.  Gilda's Club Worldwide, the headquarters organization, works with communities around the world to start and sustain Gilda's Clubs and to advocate for the importance of  emotional and social support for anyone touched by cancer.  Gilda's Club depends on gifts from the people who believe in the importance of our mission, or those who simply want to honor a loved one. It is free of charge and nonprofit, Gilda's Club offers support and networking groups, lectures, workshops and social events in a nonresidential, homelike setting.
