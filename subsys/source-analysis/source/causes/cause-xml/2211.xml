  <description>Each year thousands of our loved ones die from this hateful diease. It not only takes our loved ones away  from us, but it also affects the families that are left behind, who never heal from the pain that cancer has caused them. 

I started this cause in memory of a very special man to me,  Craig Spracklin, Jan 12, 1972- May 31, 2005 who passed away after a short but courageous battle against  ALL (Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia)

"May the memory of those you loved never die, for as sure as the sun sets, and another day dawns....our loved ones are with us, disguised as angels that we simply cannot see."

1. Cancer is a diease that can attack young and old 

2. There is no cure for cancer...yet

3. Cancer affects both patients and their families</description>
