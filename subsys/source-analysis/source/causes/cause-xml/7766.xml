  <description>We started in 2004 -- founded by a group of young Montanans frustrated with politics as usual. We wanted an organization that would stand up for the values of our generation, while connecting ourselves and our peers with existing political opportunities.

Donations to us get made to the Oregon Progress Forum, which fiscally sponsors our education and charitable civic engagement work.</description>
