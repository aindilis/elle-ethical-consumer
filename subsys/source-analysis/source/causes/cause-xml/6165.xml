  <description>The Bill of Rights, ratified the 15th of December, 1791 included three amendments that guaranteed:

I.) Trial by Jury
II.) Rights for the Accused
III) Due Process and protection from Double Jeopardy.
IV.) And many more rights

These rights would ensure that every man (and woman) was treated accordingly and was "innocent until guilty".

But,

Recently, most of the Constitutional rights are twisted or bended in many ways. Corruption has now permeated all stages of the trial process, even the pre-process of being arrested (many have been forced to sign documents under threats). Habeas Corpus has been suspended for many, and that is just the top layer of the changing times we are encountering. Lady Justice's blindfold is slowly slipping off, and we need to help get it back on.
