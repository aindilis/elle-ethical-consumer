  <description>Hat McCullough is a man just like any other man.  Some say he is a serial killer, some say he is a hero.  I believe the latter.  Those 23 babies and toddlers he killed were in self defense.  All the evidence points to that.  Babies are the most dangerous and ferocious creatures this Earth has ever seen.  Hat is just a victim of this damn baby loving society.  The goals of this cause are to free Hat McCullough immediately and I urge you to support this cause for the sake of mankind.

1. FREE HAT!</description>
