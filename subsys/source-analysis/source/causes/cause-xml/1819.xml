  <description>Everybody deserves the right to live. Ending a pregnancy because you don't want to be responsible for another life or you don't have the money to support a child is unacceptable. There are other options than murdering an innocent baby. Any hosiptal will take a child. There are adoption agencies you can give the baby to. What if your mother decided to have an abortion. Think about it.

To the women who say they are ProChoice- You're right you do have a choice. The choice is to have sex or not have sex. It's that simple. 

Rape cases- Studies show that women who have an abortion after being raped are more likely to have depression and anxiety. It causes more damage than you're lead to believe.

1. Every baby has a right to life.</description>
