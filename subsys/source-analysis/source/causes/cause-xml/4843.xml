  <description>The Leary Firefighters Foundation was founded by actor Denis Leary in response to the devastating loss of six firefighters in a 1999 warehouse fire in his hometown of Worcester, Massachusetts. One of these firefighters was Mr. Leary's cousin and another was a close childhood friend. While helping his community deal with that tragedy, Mr. Leary learned that there was a profound need for private aid to help fire departments obtain essential equipment, technology and training - funding which local governments struggle to provide.
