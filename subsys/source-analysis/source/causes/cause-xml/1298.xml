  <description>The goal here is to force the petrol company's to lower prices by getting EVERYONE to buy fuel from one supplier.  Petro Can or Esso.  Starve the other &amp; this will eventually force the other to lower prices.

1. Were being gouged at the pump, it is time to stop this.

2. Long weekend fuel price increases must end.

3. We will be the cause of a war between the giants.</description>
