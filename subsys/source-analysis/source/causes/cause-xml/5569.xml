  <description>Atlas wants to see free societies develop all over the world, and we believe this depends on winning &#8220;the battle of ideas&#8221; &#8211; a battle that cannot be won without local institutions making the case for human rights, economic freedom, civil society, the rule of law and limited government. That&#8217;s why Atlas works as a catalyst for the development of independent think tanks that can develop a public consensus in favor of a free society. 

Atlas helps such organizations in their early stages, so that those who aspire to create freedom-oriented think tanks in their home country can learn from the experience of their peers from all over the world. Thus, Atlas is the hub of a diverse network of hundreds of think tanks and scholars that share a common vision of advancing individual freedom, and reducing arbitrary government power.

Help Atlas today!  For 26 years, Atlas has helped around the world.  Our friends like Franklin Cudjoe who successfully lobbied for the privitization of water rights in Ghana for CLEANER and CHEAPER water! For more of these fascinating stories, please visit our website at www.atlasUSA.org
