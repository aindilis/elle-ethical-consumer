  <description>The purpose of Holmes Presbyterian Camp and Conference Center is to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ through instruction, outreach, personal growth, recreation, and also to be a Christ-centered witness to the issues of conservation, ecology, peace, and justice. The objectives of Holmes are to provide a place set apart in the midst of the most urbanized region of the world for Christian nurture, witness, outreach and mission through the building of inclusive, healing and reconciling communities in the Center's retreats, conferences and camping programs. For generations of participants over the last 60 years, Holmes is a special place. Perhaps difficult to explain, the spirit of the place -- and of the people -- shines through when friends remember. All have walked away with a gift: the gift of memories and living faith . . . some very personal, some very intense. Moments of Christ's love realized, in a special way, we never forget.
