  <description>I want to raise awareness about how abortion is wrong. 

Every life has a propose on this earth. 

 In Jeremiah 1:4 it says "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you. Before you were born I set you apart."

Help us in the fight to stop abortion by donating money to your local, regional, &amp; national Pro-Life organizations. 

We must choose life for the unborn.


In these troubled times when all our morals and values are under attack. There is one struggle we all must share for those who can not fight back.
   
I speak of the unborn child-no more oppressed minority can there be. Why is he denied his one basic right in America. "the land of the free". 

Some say it's a matter of free will, others say it's and individual's choice. I say that all who care must speak out for those who have no voice!

The taking of a human life brings shame upon us all. The murder of our children is a crime we must outlaw.

so if we raise our voices for the cause in which we strive. We can prevent this slaughter and protect our right to life.
