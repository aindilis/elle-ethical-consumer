  <description>Project Kindle, formerly known as Camp Kindle, has been providing cost free services to children, adolescents, and families since 1999. This nonprofit, which primarily serves those infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS, began with a weeklong summer camping session known as Camp Kindle. Over the last few years, we have expanded our services to offer multiple camping sessions and year round support, a peer led speakers bureau, a continued education scholarship fund, and HIV/AIDS education and outreach. 

Today Project Kindle touches the lives of over 15,000 children, young adults and families each year.
