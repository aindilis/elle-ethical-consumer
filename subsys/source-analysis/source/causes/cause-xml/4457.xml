  <description>WE LOVE THIS AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND INTELLIGENT WOMAN (;p)

&#8220;Every woman should have four pets in her life. A mink in her closet, a jaguar in her garage, a tiger in her bed, and a jackass who pays for everything.&#8221;

&#8220;The way I see it, you should live everyday like its your birthday&#8221;

&#8220;The only rule is don't be boring and dress cute wherever you go. Life is too short to blend in.&#8221;

&#8220;Wal-mart... do they like make walls there?&#8221;

I don't really think, I just walk.&#8221;

&#8220;A true heiress is never mean to anyone - except a girl who steals your boyfriend&#8221;

&#8220;All British people have plain names, and that works pretty well over there.&#8221;

&#8220;I loved all the Aaron Spelling shows, &#8216;Beverly Hills 90210' and &#8216;Models Inc.' At that time, I had pet rats I was raising and I always named all the baby rats after the characters in the shows.&#8221;
