  <description>Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Bay Area (San Francisco) has been providing mentoring services to Bay Area kids for 50 years.  Studies have proven the effectiveness of the positive, one-to-one relationships we foster (called "matches"): our kids are 46% less likely to use drugs, 27% less likely to abuse alcohol, 33% less likely to use violence to solve problems, etc. Our kids stay in school and become positive members of society. It takes money for the interviews, background checks, reference checks, and ongoing monthly support that nurtures these matches and turns them into the long-term, positive relationships that absolutely transform lives.  There are over 200,000 kids in the Bay Area aged 6 - 18 living at home with a single parent earning less than the Federal poverty line. Our goal is to grow to serve 5,000 kids a year by 2010.  There are 897 boys and girls on our waiting list right now (July 2007) - your contribution to our "Wait Loss" program will help get those kids off our waiting list and matched with a Big Brother or Big Sister of their own.

1. Children grow up to be like the people around them.

2. Your contribution is the difference between a kid that has a "Big" and one who doesn't</description>
