  <description>A recent study produced that by 2017, Cheetahs are predicted to be extinct! Not only Cheetahs but other Endangered species too. Among the other of the Big Cats, Cheetahs are on a rapid decrease and without the help of sponsorships and donations to programs that aid in the survival of these majestic animals, we are merely standing back and waving good-bye!

This cause supports the research and aids in the funding of all that is involved with the Cheetahs survival, like rearing them from young, due to various reasons, and once again, releasing them back into the wild.

1. Make a difference in trying to save the Cheetahs from Extinction!

2. Preserve a part of Wildlife for generations to come!

3. Make a difference when others choose not to!</description>
