  <description>The Secular Student Alliance (SSA), founded in May 2000, is the only independent, democratically structured organization in the U.S. that serves the needs of freethinking high school and college students.

It is an educational nonprofit whose purpose is to educate high school and college students about the value of scientific reason and the intellectual basis of naturalism.  Many of its constituents call themselves atheists, agnostics, skeptics or humanists.

The SSA offers students and their organizations a variety of resources, including but not limited to leadership training and support, guest speakers, discounted literature and conference tickets, project grants, travel grants, and thought provoking online articles and opinions.

The SSA has local affiliates at high schools and colleges all over the world (the majority of them are in the United States)

1. One can lead a meaningful and moral life without belief in the supernatural.

2. Careful observation and reason are better ways to understand the world than faith.

3. The separation of religion and government is a critical part of good government.

4. Organizations need to be accountable to the people over whom they have power.</description>
