  <description>Many people, all over the world have seem to loss the ability or inclination to properly use reason in making decisions in their life. 
Today, very few decisions affect only the decision-maker.
"who to vote for"
"what to believe"
"what is worth fighting for"
"what is worth dying for..."

From the misguided youth who are told that the glory of god awaits them if they blow up themselves to the hordes of voters who succumb to fear and uncertainty.
Reason is the missing constant in all these equations. 
We believe without question, as if unquestioning faith is a virtue, and to do otherwise is blasphemy.


Smart people don't know everything. A really smart person recognises how stupid he really is.
No donations needed for this cause, just an appreciation for the need for reason and intellectual curiosity in every facet of life. 

1. Use reason in everything in life.

2. NEVER believe anything without proof.

3. Always ask questions. </description>
