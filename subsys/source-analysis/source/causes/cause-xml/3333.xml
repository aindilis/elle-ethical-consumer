  <description>It has been my deepest desire for many years now to make and see change occur in third world countries. It is heart breaking to see innocent little children starving and dying in third world countries around the world because they do not have even the BASICS to survive in life. 
No health care of any kind, food, water, shelter, security, and some even without family or someone to love and care for them. 
About 3 years ago I began collecting pennies. I picked them off the ground (because people drop them without care all the time -- as if it isn't currency), and in spare change I receive. I put pennies aside and within just 1 year I had $85 worth of pennies.
IMAGINE if everyone in North America did that. A simple amount of $3.65 each year (merely a penny a day). If we ALL did that simple bit we would have litteraly millions of dollars in one year alone!
Imagine what that could do for a child, a family, an entire nation in poverty!

So please join with me in supporting this dire need. Save some lives with a simple action of picking up a penny off the ground... or maybe two!

It's not a huge commitment. Even a toddeler could manage to scrounge/find a penny each day!

It isn't asknig much from us at all... but it can do SO much for a child suffering in 3d world poverty!


I encourage you to...
Give a little SOMETHING to the children who have NOTHING!

1. Giving something to children who have nothing!

2. A penny a day!

3. Putting an end to 3rd world child poverty!</description>
