  <description>My name is Stephanie Bratton and i am a 25 year old female with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). I live in Kokom, Indiana. I was dignosed when i was three years old. Everyday is a battle but i fight it harded and harder everyday. I was sick as a little kid but as i have gotten older my CF has progressed at a pretty rapid speed. In 2003, I got really sick and had to be put on oxygen. In 2004, I got a transtracal oxygen catheter put in my air way to get my O2 better. I am now on my O2 all the time and have a pretty rough time, In March of this year I was put on the transplant list for double lung and a pancrease. I am not going to lay down and let my CF win the battle me and my family have been fighting for so many years. That is one thing that I have always said that i would not let CF win. In my eyes that is what it is everyday when you wake up you fight and when you wake up the next morning you can say you beat CF another day. But to all you that have it stay positive in your fight and always remember they are always finding new drugs and some one else is going through the same thing you are rather you know them or not you are never alone.
