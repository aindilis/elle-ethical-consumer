  <description>The Weekend to End Breast Cancer benefiting Princess Margaret Hospital is an amazing weekend, September 7th - 9th, 2007, where thousands of women and men will unite in Toronto to walk 60 kilometres in a bold display of courage and commitment. It&#8217;s a weekend of hope, as we honour lives lost, celebrate survivors, and help bring breast cancer care to those who so desperately need it. The money I will help raise will benefit Princess Margaret Hospital, a leader in the fight against breast cancer. Its so simple to sponser a participant, simpy visit www.endcancer.ca click on sponser a participant, type Delia Martinez, and donate. Thank you for your support! Together we can make a difference.
