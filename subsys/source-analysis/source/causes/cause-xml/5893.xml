  <description>Chris Rock Once said, &#8220;In the whole country we&#8217;ve got this real fucked up gang mentality. Republicans are idiots, Democrats are idiots, the conservatives are idiots and liberals are idiots. Pretty much anyone that makes up their mind before they hear the issue is a fucking fool&#8230;OK? Everybody wants to be in a gang so bad&#8230; I&#8217;m conservative, I&#8217;m liberal. Just be a fucking person. No decent person is one thing. OK? Just hear it out, let it swirl around then form your opinion. I&#8217;m a person, I got some shit I&#8217;m conservative about, I got some shit I&#8217;m liberal about. Crime, I&#8217;m conservative. Prostitution&#8230;I&#8217;m liberal.&#8221;


He may be a comic, bt that has to be one of the most truthful sayings about out system.

1. LISTEN. Let it swirl around in your head. Then form your opinion

2. ANY sane person is more then 1 thing.

3. Be a person not a gang.</description>
