  <description>Michael was one of those unfortunate children who were diagnosed with cancer, yet he won the battle. Although he passed away at the tender age of 16 due to respiratory complications, his legacy to Make a Difference in the fight against childhood cancer still lives on today. 

Cancer found in children is different from cancer found in adults. There is currently not enough funding or research being done at the childhood level. These children cannot be forgotten. The average age of a child diagnosed with cancer is six years old. No family should have to lose a loved one at such a tender young age. We do have treatments to cure some childhood cancers but today's treatments can leave lifelong complications which can affect the rest of these children's lives. 

Michael Cuccione Foundation campaigns and raises funds for childhood cancer research. Please donate today and help us "Make a Difference"!
