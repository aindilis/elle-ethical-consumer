- Gap (PRODUCT) RED is about great products that can help make a difference for Africa. As a global partner of (PRODUCT) RED, we&#8217;re contributing half the profits from Gap (PRODUCT) RED sales to the Global Fund to help women and children affected by HIV/AIDS in Africa.

- How we do business is as important as what we do. Gap (PRODUCT) RED takes what we do best&#8212;creating great products that people love&#8212;and channels it into positive change. In addition to sharing profits from Gap (PRODUCT) RED with the Global Fund, we're also investing in Africa by making some of our products there.

- Change is happening.
While there are no easy answers for Africa, (PRODUCT) RED is a step in the right direction. Read the stories on our webpage to learn more about how Gap and (PRODUCT) RED are working to make a difference.
