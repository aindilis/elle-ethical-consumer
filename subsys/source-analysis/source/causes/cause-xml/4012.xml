  <description>Our mission is to cause the great zombie apocalypse.  I suggest we start digging up corpses and expose them radiation, atheism, cosmic rays, toxic waste, biological warfare agents, monkeys filled with rage, strange gasses, electricity, evil scientists, and satan's wrath becuase there is no more room in hell.  So lets get on it people dig up a corpse today.
