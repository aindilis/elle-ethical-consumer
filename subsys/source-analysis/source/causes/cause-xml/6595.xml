  <description>The POWER OF CANCER is a dreaded force causing pain and suffering everywhere.  All of us have been touched by cancer, giving us the POWER OF DETERMINATION to do something to ease the burden of this terrible disease.  We empower ourselves by participating in this to raise funds for research to find a cure, and by raising awareness of cancer prevention, early detection, treatment and patient services provided by the American Cancer Society.

Equally important tonight is the POWER OF REMEMBRANCE, for we must never forget those whose lives have been lost to cancer and those courageous survivors who inspire us all.

1. Ease the burden of this terrible disease

2. Raise funds for research and awareness

3. Celebrate with those who have survived

4. Most importantly to remember those lost because of Cancer</description>
