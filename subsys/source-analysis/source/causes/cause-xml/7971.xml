  <description>Millions of aninimals are put down yearly by the SPCA because they are unable to financially support them. With this cause we would like to encourage people to rather support the SPCA by adopting a pet from their local SPCA and in thus way also funding protection and help for future animals.

1. Adopt a Pet from the SPCA and funding them at the same time.

2. Save a animals life by giving him a good home.

3. Why support a Pet Shop who is only interested in making profit and not in the welfare of the animal.

4. If you want to adopt a pet, examine your heart, your schedule, and your wallet.</description>
