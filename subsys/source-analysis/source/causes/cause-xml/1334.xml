  <description>Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) because they cause severe inflammation of the intestinal tract, and have common symptoms. The cause remains unknown, and there is no medical cure.

The Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation of America was founded in 1967. Its mission is to raise funds: to support basic and clinical scientific research to find the cause of, and cure for, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis; to provide educational programs for patients, medical and other healthcare professionals, and the general public; and to offer supportive services for patients, their families, and their friends.

In 1968, CCFA awarded its first research grant of $10,000. Thirty years later, the foundation funded $4.4 million in peer-reviewed research projects in the field of IBD. A major force among health foundations, CCFA also sponsors outstanding international research conferences, workshops, and symposia. With 55 chapters across the country and more than 150,000 members, donors, and friends (including many prominent gastroenterologists and surgeons), CCFA is helping local communities with support groups, educational seminars, hospital visitation programs, and community outreach campaigns.

The foundation has also developed a wealth of education material, including several full-length books, and a Web site(www.ccfa.org). Each year, tens of thousands of brochures are distributed free of charge to patients, physicians, and hospitals, while PSAs reach out to millions of people to raise awareness of the seriousness of IBD.
