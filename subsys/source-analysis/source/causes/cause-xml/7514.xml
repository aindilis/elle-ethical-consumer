  <description>Please take a moment to think about the place you grew up in, close your eyes and picture it...the country, the state, the city or town.  Can you see it?  The grassy field by the river, the busy streets of the market, the little cafe where you would sip a coffee and read the paper.  The people greet each other in the streets, smiles on their faces.  Can you see them?  

Beautiful isn't it.  


Now open your eyes. Can you STILL see it?
Or can you see the crime that goes on in the "shady" area of town, or the brown cloud that seems to engulf your life on what used to be a nice sunny day.  How about the people?  What do their faces look like now?  Can you see less money in your pocket and more in corporate bank accounts?  What about the government granting a 15 percent pay increase for themselves, and not discussing issues that matter to people like you and me until the end of a lengthy summer holiday?

I can see it, and I don't like it.
