  <description>There has been a "coming soon" sign for several years now and it's time for the park to be opened for all to use.  Our neighborhood, and Los Angeles in general, is park-poor and the fact that the only progress that has been made has been to fence this large swath of grass is disgraceful and inexcusable.  The timing couldn't be more appropriate with summer right around the corner.  Finally, opening this park will cost very little since the grounds are already landscaped.

1. Parks are a fundamental right.

2. Los Angeles has too few parks.

3. The expensive gates that were installed at the site should be thrown open to allow access to the green space for all.</description>
