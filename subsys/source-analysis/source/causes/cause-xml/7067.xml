  <description>In the last 19 years, civil war in Sri Lanka has resulted in the death of over 64,000 children, women and men. The fighting between the warring parties &#8211; the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Government of Sri Lanka &#8211; is responsible for not only the deaths of tens of thousands, but also has caused the displacement of nearly 800,000 people. Children who are displaced often run the risk of being recruited into the ranks of the LTTE, and to date there are more than 1,000 children still in the LTTE despite a fragile cease-fire agreed to by both parties.

 let us all make a dent on the current situation of our country 

1. Ending the war
