  <description>Attention Wrestling Fans: Are you sick of watching mainstream promotions and seeing nothing but offensive storylines and sophomoric humor? Are you sick of watching pro wrestling become nothing more than a glorified soap opera? Wouldn't you rather see competitive, athletic WRESTLING contests instead of all this BS? 
So would I. There's an solution to this problem. Independent pro wrestling offers everything that the bigger promotions don't. There's something for everyone, whether you like strong style, lucha, technical, etc. 
But, these smaller promotions struggle to increase their fanbases and earn revenue. We can help. Whether it's ROH, CHIKARA, PWG, IWA, or any other, help to spread the world about independent pro wrestling.
Sick of being made fun of for watching wrestling? Do something about it.

1. There is a fundamental problem with the programming being shown by mainstream companies like WWE.

2. Independent federations offer an alternative based on the wrestling itself and not on the storylines.

3. Independent federations need our help to constantly increase their fanbases.</description>
