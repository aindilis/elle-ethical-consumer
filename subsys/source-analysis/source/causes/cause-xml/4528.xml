  <description>    Have you ever been yelled at by some idiot driver for being on the road and not on the sidewalk?  And then, when you do get on the sidewalk a police officer tells you to get off?  And then, yet another driver tells you to get to the sidewalk?  Why should bikers continue to be threatened and forced off of the road when the law states that we have the same rights to the road that cars do?  Why aren't the police doing anything about it?  This cause was started to give bikers their rights and to get the police to actually do something.  We ask for biker lanes, but then we get something paid for by our tax dollars that only benefits drivers.  We keep the traffic down, causing fewer wrecks; we don't use as much gas, this keeps gas cheap, the air clear, and if there is no oxygen left, fuel cannot burn.  
    And still, drivers call us a nuisance?  Well, I say "you're welcome" anytime I'm attacked for helping them out.  Keep that in mind the next time you feel like being a jerk to that kid on the bike.  If you discourage him enough, he'll just drive all the time and then everyone will.  If that kid stays on his bike and doesn't use a car as much, he's doing a whole damn lot more than you are for our environment, economy, and safety.

1. Bikers are people

2. We have rights

3. The law states these rights

4. We pay taxes too; we should get the biker lanes we ask for.  Otherwise we should stop paying taxes</description>
