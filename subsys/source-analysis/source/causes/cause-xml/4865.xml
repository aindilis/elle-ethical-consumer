  <description>Thousands of people are killed, injured, raped, and forced to flee from their homes as a result of the unregulated global arms trade. The Control Arms campaign is calling for an international, legally-binding Arms Trade Treaty to ease the suffering caused by irresponsible weapons transfers.

Since its beginning in October 2003, Control Arms has gathered the support of over one million people worldwide. In December 2006, 153 governments voted at the United Nations to start work on developing an international Arms Trade Treaty.

Now we need your support to make sure it's effective. Join us.

Please note, just because the option to donate exists, this campaign is not about giving money and there is no way round having this option on the page. This campaign is about AWARENESS and CHANGE, so please do not be fooled by the Recruiting and Donating options, because they are not the means of success in any campaign.
