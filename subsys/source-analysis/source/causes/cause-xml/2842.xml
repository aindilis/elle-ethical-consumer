  <description>Teens toda, hav freedoms but its not all teens wu do. Parents think they are still kids. Teens should have more freedom, eg choice of dressing, eating, havin a license of a vehicle, vote in an election,drop/continue school, - No drinkin until 16, no smokin until 18. Sex, drugs- watch it GANGS(guys and girls)!!!

BUT REMEMBER TEENS&lt;&lt; IS ALL LEFT TO YOU TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION.
ONCE IN YOUR LIFE, YOU HAVE TO INDEPENDENT OF YOURSELF- DON'T DO THINGS YOU WILL REGRET IN FUTURE AS LONG AS YOU LIVE FREE.

GOD WATCHES US ALL THE TIME!!. GOD LOVS US 2!!!
GO IN FREENESS, BE IN PEACE, DO NOT JAIL YOUR FREEDOM.!!
