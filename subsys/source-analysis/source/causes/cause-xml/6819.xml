  <description>With the publication of the Motu Proprio, Summorum Pontificum, liberalising the celebration of the Missale Romanum of 1962, by His Holiness, Pope Benedict XVI, we vow to dedicate our energies to the circulation and transmission of this document as well as purposing to uphold the textual integrity and authoritative interpretation of the said document.

1. The pre-conciliar liturgy is a valuable piece of Western culture and should be preserved.

2. To engage accurately in the Hermeneutic of Continuity we hold that the pre-conciliar liturgy is a necessary means to organically develop the Pauline rite.

3. We will remain faithful to the Second Vatican Council, will obey H.H. Pope Benedict XVI, and will engage in active dialogue with those who oppose either.

4. We will not become 'Liturgical Supremasts' asserting superiority of rite, but will seek to reform the errors in prudential judgment that plague the current Missal.

5. We will attend to this in solidarity to the Roman Pontiff.</description>
