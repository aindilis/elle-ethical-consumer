  <description>(ne-v&#233; shal-om / waah-at i-sal-aam: Hebrew and Arabic for Oasis of Peace [Isaiah 32:18]): A village, jointly established by Jewish and Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, that is engaged in educational work for peace, equality and understanding between the two peoples.

Neve Shalom - Wahat al-Salam gives practical expression to its vision of an egalitarian society through pioneering educational work at The School for Peace, Children&#8217;s Educational System and Pluralistic Spiritual Centre. Besides its educational work, NSWAS and its members also conduct other projects such as Humanitarian aid program. Occasionally, summer programs are offered for overseas guests.

NSWAS has a 39-room hotel, an attractive swimming pool, spacious conference halls, and a restaurant. We also offer a variety of interesting programs for visitors.

Neve Shalom/Wahat al-Salam could not conduct its educational work or continue to develop without the moral and financial support of foundations and individuals in many places. Please contact us to learn how you can help.
