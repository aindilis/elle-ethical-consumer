  <description>Our family has recently been the victim of a suicide attempt. We feel that it is very important to get the information out, that there are so many more options for lifes trials and tribulations. We are trying to raise $700.00 to have a spokes person come to Coldlake, AB. We would then use any additional money to get spokes persons to other towns as there is no support &amp;/or awarness provide in small communities. IF THIS IS SOMETHING YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PLEASE FEEL FREE TO GO TO THE ATTACHED WEBSITE AND SEND YOUR DONATIONS THROUGH THERE AS I COULD ONLY PICK AN AMERICAN SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAM. http://www.mindfulcreations.com/randie/default.htm

1. The rate of completd suicides has increased 280% from 1950 to 1990

2. Suicide has taken the lives of approx 10 people per day

3. 70% of people will not get help as they are embarrassment, shame, fear, stigma and/or blame.  </description>
