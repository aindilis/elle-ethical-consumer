  <description>The renaissance period was a large turning point in history.  There was a large emphasis on the arts, style, government, and education.  Our world wouldn't be where it is today without this period of history.

Renaissance re-enactors strive to re-create this setting for the masses.  Through wenches, pirates, bards, lords and ladies we are given a view into the world that came before!

Real men know how to wear a kilt and only a real woman can wear a tight bodice!  HUzzah!

1. Men have the right to wear kilts in the traditional manner.

2. Women have the right to have thier chest exposed in a tight bodice.

3. Muskettes and cannons are appropriate field artillary.

4. One Day the members of the SCA and other re-enactors will take over the world.</description>
