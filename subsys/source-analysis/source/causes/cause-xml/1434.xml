  <description>We are an after-school and summer program that provides fun and educational activities, as well as free time, to at-risk youth ages 5-18 that live in a rural town in NY.  Our center is open to youth in the school district.  We have a strength-based approach to helping the young people grow, which means we focus on things they know and are good at.  We are recognized as 501(c)(3).

***PLEASE NOTE***  The company that provides "Causes" charges a 4.5% service fee for your donation.  If you do not wish for that percentage to go to them, there are other ways to donate to this organization.  Thank you!

1. All youth should receive the attention and care necessary to become healthy, happy adults.

2. Young people are valuable resources in our community.</description>
