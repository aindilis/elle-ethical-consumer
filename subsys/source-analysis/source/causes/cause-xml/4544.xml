  <description>The cutter patrol goes around and sees who is cutting if we do find someone who cuts the punishments differ from male to female. For male cutters we break there arms ensuring they cannot cut while they have a cast. Females we do not harm physically but try to make them stop by name calling bribary, using the force, laser eye vision, and seduction.
