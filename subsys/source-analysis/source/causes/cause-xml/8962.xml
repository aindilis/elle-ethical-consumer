  <description>Remember when keytars were 'the instrument'? Well, they are very scarce now. With the few exceptions (Mute Math, Showbread, David Crowder Band, etc.), keytars have become all but non existant. If we can get enough members of this cause, it might just be enough for all those good bands out there to get a keytar player.

Keytars are not only instruments, they are representational figures. They come from an era when more music was thought out and properly performed, with a wide variety of methods in which to perform them. If keytars die completely, they not only eradicate keytars themselves, part of that music history dies with them.

1. Keytars need to be used often.

2. Keytars represent a different style of music, and more importantly, a different way to play music.

3. Keyboard players should consider adding a keytar to their arsenal of instruments.</description>
