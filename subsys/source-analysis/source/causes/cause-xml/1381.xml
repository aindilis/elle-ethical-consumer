  <description>Every Year, we hold Desert Jeep Rally in Cholistan Desert to protect local people of Cholistan from basic problem of Scarcity. Since the Independence of Pakistan, thousands have died from shortage of food and water. People have no jobs to earn for theirselves. The Main aim of Rally is to collect as much money as we could to arrange food and water and to employ them. The Rally is also aiming to explore the culture of Cholistan and to attract as many tourists as Possible. I'll Request you People to Come and Donate as much as you could for the sake of humanity. Thankyou
