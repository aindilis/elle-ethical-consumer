  <description>Together since 1999, supporters of The Hunger Site have given more than 500 million cups of food to those in need. You can help make a difference, too--it's as simple as a click!

Join me in fighting hunger! A daily click at The Hunger Site will automatically give over a cup of food to those in need. It costs us nothing! Site sponsors pay for the value of the food, which supports the work of Mercy Corps and America's Second Harvest.

Because we click daily, we are able to improve the lives of millions over time. Please spread the word today.
