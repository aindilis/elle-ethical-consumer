  <description>This was the very first cause created specifically for AVM on Facebook. I started this cause after my sister passed away from an AVM of her brain stem. I was disappointed that there wasn't a single cause dedicated to this of Facebook, so I took it upon myself to make one. 


AVM, or Arteriovenous Malformation, is a fragile entanglement of the veins and arteries. It can occur in several places in the body, including the brain, spinal column, liver, kindneys, and lungs. Once this delicate fusion of veins and arteries is ruptured, the bleeding can be horrendous, especially if it occurs in the brain. This can cause devastatingly severe and, sometimes, fatal strokes. 

Rarely detected early enough, most people with AVM are unaware that they have it.

1. The general public must be made aware of this silent killer.

2. More research must be done to determine definitively if AVM can be passed through heredity.</description>
