  <description> The King cheetah, is a cheetah with a different coat pattern, they have never been very populated but now are decreasing very fast. Poaching and habitat lost have been a big contribution to there disappearance. there are an approximate 10 wild ones left. and the last wild one spotted, was 7 years ago. Obviously this says something. please don't let this beautiful creature go away. They deserve to be on this planet, just as much as we do.

1. poaching should end

2. more security for wild cats should be ensured 

3. the population of king cheetahs should thrive once again</description>
