  <description>Global Playground is a 501(c)(3) public charity, committed both to funding the education of children in underdeveloped and developing countries, and promoting the importance of education and cross-cultural understanding in the developing world.

We believe strongly that education is the most promising means to eliminating poverty, violence, intolerance, and misunderstanding in our world. We also believe that young minds are most open to cross-cultural understanding and appreciation of difference.

The Global Playground is coming to children everywhere. Learning starts here.
