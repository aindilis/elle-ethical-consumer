  <description>We provide free anti retroviral, chemotherapy and opportunistic infection (tuberculosis, pneumonia, malaria, etc) medicine to children affected by AIDS.  We also provide medicine to pregnant women so that their babies will have a higher chance of being born free of the virus.  Guardians of children we serve also receive free medicine from AFCA, thereby stopping the creation of more orphans.

Besides medicine, we provide medical supplies to rural hospitals in Uganda and food and other humanitarian aid items to children and families in our programs in Kenya.

We currently work in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Kenya.
