  <description>The MPAA's only purpose is profit, they are the enemy of the free world, they have SUPERNOVA closed and are working to close other super cool websites.

They are trying to have cell phones banned in movie theaters or have radio waves jammed because people can IM their friends telling them a movie was no good, thus making them lose profit.

They are pushing DRM media, to prevent people from sharing, proving that their values are based on selfishness. 

They are pushing to have new DISC format ex.: HD-DVD and BLU-RAY so copy protected that you backup your own disc.

1. Open minded

2. Sharing
