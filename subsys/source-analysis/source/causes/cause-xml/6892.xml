  <description>The decline of the pirate community has a direct connection to many of our world's problems today. It is our belief that an increased amount of pirates in this world would yield positive effects for all of mankind. If one were to observe the time line concerning the decline of the pirate community, one would notice that after the point in time where piracy had nearly been put to an end, a few problems such as these arose:

World War I
World War II
The Cuban Missile Crisis
Global Warming
An Increase in the Frequency of Natural Disasters
Terrorism
An Increase in Automobile Related Accidents
Boy Bands
Carrot Top
An Increase in Gasoline and Oil Prices

Please, think of this world and think of those poor, poor pirates.

*NOTE: We do not support media and software piracy. Those people who practice media piracy should be ashamed for giving such a bad name to those few real pirates still out there.



1. Pirates are good.

2. Pirates will solve our world's problems.

3. Carrot Top is NOT FUNNY</description>
  <mission>Nurture and care to the pirate population to such an extent that will allow us to reintroduce pirates back into society for the greater common good.</mission>
