  <description>Closing the detention facility at  Guant&#225;namo means that each detainee is either charged with a crime and fairly tried in US federal court, or is released to a country where his human rights will be respected. 

In other words, no indefinite detention and no unfair military commissions. President Obama has proposed continuing both at Thompson prison in Illinois. That would just mean changing Guantanamo's zip code.

The military commissions were set up by U.S. politicians--not the military--and do not meet U.S., international or even U.S. military standards for fairness. But they do make it easier to hide evidence of U.S. torture and abuse. 

Indefinite detention is a hallmark of repressive dictatorships around the world. U.S. adoption of it has weakened human rights both at home and abroad.

Those responsible for 9/11 must be brought to justice, but real justice requires a real court. Close Guantanamo and end the human rights violations it stands for.
