  <description>Every once in a while, a young white girl, such as the now famous Madeline McCann, goes missing. And while there is great sympathy for her and her family and friends, there are hundreds of children who go missing every day. And due to where they live, their social status, or their ethnicity, they do not get the media coverage and police attention that Madeline has been getting. She has had celebrity endorsments from J.K. Rowling, David Beckham, and even the pope.Now the media is saying that she may have been killed accidentally, and that her parents covered it up.  This is a form of discrimination, and has to be stopped. All children, and adults alike, are equal, and should get the same attention and sympathy as the next. Some people may think that it's not their problem, and don't care because this happens so often. How would you like it if you went missing for years and eventually died, because someone thought you weren't worth it? This is a constantly overlooked problem, and needs to be stopped. 

"And the one poor child who saved this world, and there's ten million more who probably could if we all just stopped and said a prayer for them."  
                  -Better Days, The Goo Goo Dolls




1. Discrimination is wrong.

2. Humans are equal, regardless of color.

3. The social stature of a person DOES NOT determine the value of their life.</description>
