  <description>Everybody is always going around touting their own religion, but nobody wants to hear what everyone else has to say about a different religion.  I believe that each religion has something good to offer, even if it's just the ability to believe in...something!  The ability to believe in whatever your heart desires is your own right and is what helps shape who you are -- it is one of the fundamental things that helps you be you.

I won't tell you any more about my religious beliefs than you want to hear, and, in kind, if I don't want to hear what you have to say, you have to respect that.  You can't save my spiritual life, that's up to me.  I can't save your spiritual life, that's up to you.
