  <description> Its time that people realize that the color of a persons skin does not change who they are. People are treated different due to their skin color, the cloths the wear, what things they like or who they hang out with. Were all in the same world. If they're a jerk or a B**** then yeah thats a good reason to not be friends with someone, but you should always be respectful. Were all human with different interests, personalitys and colors. When your looking for a relationship you don't want someone whos exactly like you you want someone whos a little different same thing should be for a friend. "A mirror helps us look at whats on the outside and puts so many upseting thoughts in our head so maybe its time to use a mirror to see whats on the inside instead"
