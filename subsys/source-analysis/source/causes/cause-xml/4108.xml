  <description>The Susan G. Komen for the Cure Breast Cancer 3-Day is a National Philanthropic Project. Taking place in 12 cities throughout the U.S., women and men come together and walk 60 miles in 3 days to raise awareness and raise the funds necessary to eradicate breast cancer. Each walker, like myself, has to raise a minimum of $2,200 in order to participate. Please donate to the following website.
