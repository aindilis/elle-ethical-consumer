  <description>Buy your acre of rainforest. 

Cool Earth works with Fauna &amp; Flora International (Cool Earth and Flora &amp; Fauna are not registered with facebook but are duly registered charities - check out their website - DO NOT DONATE HERE but on their website directly unless you don't mind giving to another good cause instead). 

The idea behind Coolearth is that rainforests are worth much more left standing &#8211; both for the planet and for local communities. With your money, cool earth secures threatened rainforest, puts it in a local trust, and protect it around the clock to keep the carbon where it belongs. Cool Earth employs local people to do the work, help fund community health and education services and make sure the rainforest is worth more standing than cut down. If you like, you can simply make a donation. Or you can protect a specific piece of rainforest, visit it using Google Maps and get regular updates on Cool Earth's work and your rainforest

Now GO!: www.coolearth.org

Cheers,
