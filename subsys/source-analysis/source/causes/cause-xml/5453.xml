  <description>We serve God and partner with His people to extend His kingdom cross-culturally on campus and around the world.

In response to God's love, grace and truth:
The Purpose of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA is
to establish and advance at colleges and universities
witnessing communities of students and faculty
who follow Jesus as Savior and Lord:
growing in love for God,
God's Word,
God's people of every ethnicity and culture
and God's purposes in the world.

1.   Scripture: We encounter the living God through scripture and are transformed by the Holy Spirit as we read, study, teach and obey His Word. 

2. Prayer: We express our faith, love and dependence on God through lives of prayer and worship.

3. Spiritual Formation:  We cultivate intimacy with God and growth in Christ-like character through personal and corporate spiritual disciplines, empowered by the Spirit.

4. Community:  We promote authentic relationships and redemptive communities marked by God's grace and truth.

5. Discipleship of the mind:  We engage in learning and thoughtful Biblical reflection in every area of life.

6. Leadership Development:  We develop women and men to serve as leaders at every level of InterVarsity and ultimately for the Kingdom of God, honoring God's gifts and calling in them.</description>
