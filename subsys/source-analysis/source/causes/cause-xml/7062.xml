  <description>Mission
Founded in October 2001, Fertile Hope is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to providing reproductive information, support and hope to cancer patients whose medical treatments present the risk of infertility.

The organization was founded in 2001 by cancer survivor Lindsay Nohr Beck as a result of her own endeavors to preserve her fertility in the face of critical cancer treatments. 

Fertile Hope is currently pursuing strategies in the following five areas: research, awareness, education, financial assistance and support. The organization strives to advance fertility research, help advance the understanding of fertility risks and preservation options, allow and encourage personal educated decisions, make preservation treatments available regardless of economic status and help patients cope with important family planning issues.

Fertile Hope is a non-profit organization headquartered in New York City.
