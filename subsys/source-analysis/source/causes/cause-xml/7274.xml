  <description>It doesn't matter to me whether or not you have been SxE for 10 days or 16 years, it matters that you are a person too and  are not any lesser of a person because you chose not to indulge yourself in casual sex and drugs.

Three words people. DON'T. TOOL. SxE. A friend of mine pointed out to Jon and myself that some people aren't even really straightedge, and use it simply as a trend. If you intend on doing that, and just wanna make yourself cool looking, Jon or myself will remove you from the group.

As for all of you who come here and join this group and are really straightedge and are not tooling it: AWESOME. I applaud you for making such an amazing choice for your life style.
