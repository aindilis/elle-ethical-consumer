I am running the Boston Half Marathon on October 7 to raise research funds for osteosarcoma. My goal is to raise $ 1, 000 by October 4. I need everyone's support to make this goal come true. Please support my race; it does not matter how much you give. Every penny counts.  To support me, please log on to http://www.bostonmarathon.org. Click on the Half Marathon link and find the link for "support a participant" It is pretty self-explaintory. Let me know if you have any questions.. Thank you.
 
 
Respectfully,
Ijeoma Julie Eche
