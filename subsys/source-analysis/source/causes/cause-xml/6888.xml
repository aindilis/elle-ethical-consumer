  <description>We feel that herpes is not a disease worth hogging, and with a firm belief in the philosophy of sharing, hope to encourage those afflicted to spread genital herpes and allow the rest of the world the chance to experience the fire and passion in their pubic regions.

1. Sharing is caring, don't keep herpes to yourself.

2. Genital warts, like pregnancy, maintain their own unique beauty. Let them shine.

3. Embarrassment regarding your herpes need not persist. The people of the earth must embrace the disease and its beautiful transformations of the skin.</description>
