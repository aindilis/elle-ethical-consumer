  <description>Every year, 15-20,000 people are maimed or killed by landmines worldwide. One step can ultimately send a person into financial or emotional ruin. 

However, we can put an end to this problem. Humanitarian demining efforts have cleared minefields all over the world and continue to do so, and legislation for banning mines makes progress as we speak. Help eradicate this problem. Why? Because without landmines, children will be able to walk to school, farmers will be able to grow crops in newly fertile land, and once-ruined countries will be beautiful and safe again.

1. We must rehabilitate the earth from the ground up.</description>
