  <description>It seems like a nice idea to help out other countries that really do have it bad, but we've crossed a point where we've forgotten that America isn't perfect either. While we've been spending millions of dollars trying to help out other countries, it's our own that's falling apart. There is still poverty and people who don't have homes in America. There are still people who die from starvation in America. And there are still people in America who die from diseases that are easily treatable.  I believe that we need to reduce our efforts to help out other countries for a while and try and focus on helping our own country. I know it may seem mean to just stop helping other countries, but we need to find a sense of reality here; we just can't continually try to support and fix everything that's wrong with the world. We don't have the resources, nor the authority to do so. So we need to prioritize, and I think that helping out our own country's problems should be our number one before we try to help out another country.

1. We must focus on helping the American people before we help other countries.</description>
