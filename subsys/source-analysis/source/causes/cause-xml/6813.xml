  <description>Barry Bonds is only a few short home runs away from breaking Hank Aaron's all time home run mark of 755 home runs. Aaron broke this record with pure skill and athleticism and it is a shame to see it broken by a cheater who doesn't break it through skill, but through taking steroids.

1. Bonds' record must be boycotted in every way possible</description>
  <mission>protest the record that Barry Bonds is about to break. He is a steroid junkie and he is undeserving of it.</mission>
