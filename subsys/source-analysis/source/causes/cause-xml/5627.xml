  <description>       We, America's youth, look at the world we are to inheirit with discomfort. The Middle East is in turmoil, genocide rages unchecked in Darfur, and Global Warming threatens environmental disaster. Worse still, there is a complete lack of leadership in this country: No person has proven themselves capable of confronting these issues with the poise, intelligence, and compassion they demand--except, of course, Al Gore, but everyone knows he's a total pussy. 
       The Solution is Joey Miller. A Junior at the Columbus Academy, Joey Miller has the credentials needed to run our great nation: He is a masterful Tetris player, an excellent kisser, and then son of a very attractive mother. He also coined the term "meanheadface". 

1. Joey Miller should immdeiately announce his candidacy for President.

2. If Joey Miller announces his candidacy, he should challenge Barack Obama, John Edwards, Rudolph Giuliani, and Mitt Romney to a televised Tetris match. 

3. If Joey Miller wins said Tetris match, the four losing candidates should remove themselves from the campaign and go back to their other, lame jobs.</description>
