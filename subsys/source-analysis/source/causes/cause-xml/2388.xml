  <description>A declaration of principles, policies and objectives (www.extremekindness.com)

The objective of the Kindness Crew is to connect the world through kindness.

All members of the Kindness Crew commit to performing one act of kindness - big or small, random or premeditated - each day.
Kindness Crew members display compassion in their thoughts, words and actions.
Kindness Crew members have an ever-expanding definition of commmunity: they recognize that communities cannot be bound by borders, ethnicity, religion or socio-economic status.
Kindness Crew members put their PASSION INTO ACTION. They recognize that the most sustainable way to give is by bringing their unique gifts and talents to bear on all kind acts.
Kindness Crew members are committed to EDUCATING, INSPIRING AND MOBILIZING others to perform acts of community service and kindness.
Kindness Crew members strive to include friends, family and - when safe and appropriate - strangers in their acts of kindness.
Kindness Crew members are kind to themselves: mind, body and soul.
