  <description>Many establishments make veal and our mission is to stop this torture.

Veal is the meat from baby cows, less than three months old. A short lived life selfishly cut short. The baby cows (calfs) never even get the chance to learn to walk, most of which never could because they develop leg disorders from being in small crates. The crates are usually too small to lie down in. And if they are not in crates they are tied down, unable to go anywhere, nothing in life to see but the behind of another baby waiting to die before life is lived.

Why do we even need veal when there are so MANY other foods? Most baby cows ment for veal are slaughtered unhumanly for their meat.

Who will join the fight for freedom?

1. Animals have the right to actually live a life longer than 3 months.

2. Animals have the right to be killed humanly. (if killed at all)

3. Animals have the right to exercise.</description>
