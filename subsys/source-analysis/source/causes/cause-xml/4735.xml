  <description>In Africa, there is a proverb: "If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together."

Last month, Reach4Life project coordinators from 5 countries in Southern Africa met in South Africa for a time of training, planning and encouragement. At the training, one project coordinator shared this hopes for the project, &#8220;My vision is that God would have His Spirit move across Africa in such a powerful way that millions of youth would be empowered to have a relationship with Jesus, and also have the desire, wisdom and skills to make good decisions in life. That youth would have good self-esteem and be courageous, confident and content with who they are.&#8221;

Reach4Life is a 40-week faith-based HIV prevention program for high school students.Through this program, World Hope International is promoting positive behavior change to prevent HIV infection among youth. We know that if we work together, with the help of God, we will see transformation where there has been great despair and suffering.

World Hope International is introducing the program to over 20,000 youth in South Africa, Swaziland, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia this year. 

1. HIV/AIDS transmission can be stopped.
