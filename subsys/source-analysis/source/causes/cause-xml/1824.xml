  <description>"The Quality Music Revolution is the very best kind of revolution: joyful, painless and nonviolent." We're here to promote the fantastic music that is being made by unknowns on today's musical scene. In a world where the airwaves are saturated primarily by the likes of Nickelback and Justin Timberlake (no offense...much), we all know that the little independent groups deserve a chance. Furthermore, if they don't get that chance soon, quality music could get inextricably buried beneath the overwhelming commercial success of the mass-produced garbage that's permeating radio stations and the shelves of record stores.

Join the Quality Music Revolution and get the word out about the great independent bands in your area!
