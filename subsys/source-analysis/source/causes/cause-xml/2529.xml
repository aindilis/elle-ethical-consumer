  <description>There was something once, something that made America great. And Britain was great once, and so was Rome. They were expansionists; bringing the light of civilization to savages, barbatians, and those who were,  often through no fault of their own, simply ignorant. They recognized that some regions simply were not developed enough to self-govern without degenerating into civil wars, as has been seen most recently in Darfur and in the Middle East. Only the intervention of benevolent powers can stand between civilization and barbarity. And it is a struggle worth fighting. So, to properly embrace this mission, new Rules of Engagement must be instituted; so that those who endanger their lives every day for America can do their jobs without improper restraint. On the other hand, where it has been shown to be at least temporarily impossible to restore order; losses must be cut. It is a noble calling, a true vocation, a divine prupose. We must fulfill our Manifest Destiny.

1. Imperialism is currently the only reliable way to restore order

2. Any means necessary should and must be used for the greater good

3. Those who do not have the capacity to govern themselves must be governed</description>
