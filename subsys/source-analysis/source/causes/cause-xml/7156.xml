  <description>For far too long have these "cute" sea dwellers gotten away with murder. Every year, thousands of dollars are spent cutting up perfectly good fishing net to get these bastards lose. Thousands of dollars are spent paying off staff to hide the fact that the captain enjoys a little Dolphin on his toast in the morning.

Well no more. The main argument for keeping these bastards alive is that they're so smart. Well, if they're so smart then why do they keep getting caught in fishing nets ?

I personally love dolphins. I really really do. Just a little salt and some mayonaise with a hint of garlic and you've got an incredible meal.

And some dolphin jokes
