  <description>My comic (http://korea.loadingreadyrun.com) needs more readers. Why? well, there are some terrible comics out there on the internet with lots of readers. Now, while my comic is not really great, it's not terrible, so why can't Korea be an average comic with a few readers?

This isn't to make money, I don't sell ads or t-shirts. I just think more people should read an OK comic with lots of dirty jokes in it. 

1. Korea is not terrible. Well, it's not really terrible.

2. Sometimes it has some fabulously dirty jokes.

3. Dude, it's better than Pupkin, and tons of people read that crap.</description>
