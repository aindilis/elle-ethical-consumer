  <description>Early this morning, Lauren's super cute 1991 Ford Ranger we all have come to know and love had engine failure.  He needs an engine transplant. The mechanic's prognosis is not good, its either a new engine, or her dad is going to scrap the poor thing.  Lauren loves that truck &amp; she doesn't want to see it turned into a pop-can.  Show your support &amp; her dad that we love Ranger &amp; all wish for him to get a new engine! 

(P.S. I'm not asking for money, just support to save Ranger!!! heehee)

1. Ranger deserves a 2nd chance!</description>
