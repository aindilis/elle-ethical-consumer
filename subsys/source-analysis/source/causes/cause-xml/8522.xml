  <description>The Government is constantly saying that they support health care for veterans, but when it comes down to it, everyone sees that it was just an election move, and not something they really cared about!

If you would like to support this cause, financially speaking, the money will be going to a local American Legion Post, Post 393, in an effort to help gain resources to take this all the way to congress's doorstep! 

Thank you for joining the cause!

1. Health Care is a Universal Right!

2. Are Veterans laid down their lives for this Country!</description>
