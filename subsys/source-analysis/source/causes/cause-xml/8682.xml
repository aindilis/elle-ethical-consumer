  <description>Huntington's disease, a fatal, autosomal-dominant neurological illness causing involuntary movements, severe emotional disturbance and cognitive decline. Huntington's diseaseNancy Wexler usually strikes in mid-life, in the thirties or forties, although it can also attack children and the elderly. There is no treatment to halt the inexorable progression, which leads to death after ten to twenty-five years. Because it is an autosomal-dominant disorder, each child of a parent with Huntington's disease has a 50% risk of inheriting the illness. In the United States, the prevalence of the disease is about 10 cases per 100,000 people - about 30,000 people in all. There are another 150,000 individuals at risk.
