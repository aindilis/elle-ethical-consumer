  <description>Working with a coalition of organizations including the State PIRGs, USSA, Rock the Vote, NEA, and Campus Progress, we will ensure that this issue remains at the front and center of political conversations and public policy debates.

We were able to get HR 5 passes in early 2007 that slashed student interest rates in half, but we need to keep the pressure on to make sure the Senate puts more sustainable changes in place while reauthorizing the Higher Education Act.

Help us Combat Student Debt!

1. Affordable and accessible higher education is critical to creating an educated workforce

2. College graduates are shackled with debt from the day they graduate

3. Sustainable policy solutions are necessary to institutionalizing our support for affordable education</description>
