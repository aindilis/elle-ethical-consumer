  <description>Join Matt, the rightful Supreme master of Earth, and help him take over the world for the benefit of us all (except for Barney, Country musicians, Mosquito's, Ronald McDonald and GW Bush)

You wont be disappointed.


PS. Those who do not support the cause of Supreme Master Matt, will unfortunatlely have to spend eternity in a concentra.. I mean 'happy' camp where country music and bad Afrikaans music will play 24/7.
