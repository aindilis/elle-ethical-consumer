  <description>ANYONE CAN JOIN!!!!

This cause is for those who want to walk with us and it is for those who want to help raise money. For those that suffer this is what we can do for them. We come together to form one team that is strong to walk for others who have been strong on their own. We must be strong and suffer for them. It would be wonderful if we could start raising money now. 
     It would be awesome if as many people as possible would get involved. I know it will be greatly appreciated. Come and help us make a difference for a very important cause, RELAY FOR LIFE. 

    Even tho this group is for anyone I thought it would be a great way for the original team to keep in touch for next years relay. It would be nice if you all would join up so we can plan in advance and be even more prepared for the coming year :)
