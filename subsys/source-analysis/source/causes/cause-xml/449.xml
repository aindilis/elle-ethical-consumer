  <description>Out of the Shadows is for the millions of people with epilepsy and for those who have a loved one with the condition

The Epilepsy Foundation works to ensure that people with seizures are able to participate in all life experiences, and one of the ways it hopes to achieve that mission is through research.

Severe seizures that resist treatment, especially the severe seizures of early childhood, are associated with a shortened life span, risk of intellectual impairment and a sharply reduced quality of life. Despite dramatic scientific advances, there are many unanswered questions about why seizures begin, why trauma produces seizures years after the event, how genetic factors influence seizures, how epilepsy affects women&#8217;s reproductive health, and what factors make brain cells susceptible to seizures.

Only research &#8211; basic as well as clinical &#8211; will provide answers to these questions and lead eventually to the cure.
