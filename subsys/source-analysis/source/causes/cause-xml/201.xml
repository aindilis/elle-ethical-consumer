  <description>Musopen is a community driven, online music archive. This project takes music in the public domain (music without a copyright) and has it recorded and stored online so it can be accessed for free through our website.

We need your support to record music, that you will then be able to use, sell, enjoy, for any purpose, without fear of RIAA lawsuits.

1. There should be more free, non-copyrighted music online.

2. Copyrights limit the public's ability to easily access and enjoy music.

3. Unneccessary copyrights limit creative ability.</description>
