  <description>Crossroads is a non-profit pro-life organization that exists in order to help bring about a Culture of Life. Because any such culture of life must take root in the youth of our society to truly flourish, Crossroads especially looks to involve and challenge them to actively take part in bringing it about. By looking to Jesus and Mary as role models in prayer and sacrifice, and by understanding the value of suffering, we hope to convert hearts and minds and to save lives. Mindful of this mission, Crossroads looks to the following statement made by the Church in the Catholic Catechism:


"Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person - among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life."

-CCC 2270 


Religious Stance

Crossroads is a Roman Catholic Pro-Life ministry faithful to the teachings of the Church. With this in mind, Crossroads welcomes and encourages members of other faiths to participate in its activities, noting that all Christians are charged with the duty to spread God's Word and defend innocent life. 


1. All human life is sacred, from conception until natural death.

2. Every human being has a right to life and a duty to protect that right.</description>
