  <description>Total Music it about getting people to play. Music is a wonderful hobby but can be very expensive. Musi teachs childern determination and dedication to something that they can be proud of. it is our goal to make it so those who cannot afford a guitar to play or a bass or drum kit or any other instrument. to put it in there hand and get them to start to play. to teach them what we know as musicians. to let them experience their first jam session with a couple friends.

1. to make sure all children of lower income have a choice weather or not to play music</description>
