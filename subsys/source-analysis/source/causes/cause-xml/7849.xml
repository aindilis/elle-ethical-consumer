  <description>To encourage and facilitate voluntary philanthropic contributions to Southern Virginia University, with primary emphasis relating to providing scholarships to deserving students, along with other key priorities that have been outlined by the university President.

1. CHARITY-We commit to encouraging those with whom we work to implement in their lives the Savior-like quality of giving to others, recognizing that sharing is the essence of charity.

2. HUMAN WORTH -We believe that human beings are of divine parentage (our faith teaches us this, and our experience confirms it).  We will, therefore, treat others with the respect due children of God. 

3. INTEGRITY -We know our work affects the lives of individuals and families for generations, consequently, we will never knowingly betray truth or trust, in word or deed. 

4. RECOGNITION - We realize that our department (University) can be no greater than those whom it serves, therefore, we acknowledge our interdependence upon and partnership with all who faithfully labor in this cause.</description>
