  <description>Donate Life America is a not-for-profit alliance of national organizations and local coalitions across the United States dedicated to inspiring all people to save and enhance lives through organ, eye and tissue donation. 

1. Anyone can be a potential donor regardless of age, race, or medical history.

2. All major religions in the United States support organ, eye and tissue donation and see it as the final act of love and generosity toward others.

3. If you are sick or injured and admitted to the hospital, the number one priority is to save your life. Organ, eye and tissue donation can only be considered after you are deceased.

4. Signing a donor card and a driver's license with an "organ donor" designation may not satisfy your state's requirements to become a donor. Be certain to take the necessary steps to be a donor and ensure that your family understands your wishes.</description>
