  <description>The Go Green At School initiative is a simple, comprehensive program designed to create a culture of environmental responsibility on higher education (community colleges, colleges, universities, etc.) campuses across the nation. We want to unite students, professors, and school administrators in an effort to make real and lasting changes in their campus communities that will assist in protecting the environment.

This initiative falls under the authority and auspicious of the "Go Green Initiative" which was founded in 2002.
