  <description>The Cleft Palate Foundation (CPF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by cleft lip and palate and other craniofacial birth defects. It was founded in 1973 as the public service arm of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association (ACPA).

CPF operates the CLEFTLINE - 1.800.24.CLEFT - and produces free publications. The CLEFTLINE is an 800-toll free service providing information to callers about clefts and other craniofacial anomalies. Callers can request information about cleft palate/craniofacial treatment teams and parent-patient support groups in their local region.

CPF also awards research grants to support investigation into the causes and treatments of facial birth defects. College scholarships and scholarships supporting healthcare professionals are also available.

CPF is supported solely through tax-deductible contributions. Your tax deductible gift can help insure that the valuable services CPF provides to families today will continue to be available in the future.

1. We value the well-being of affected individuals and families.

2. We value the advancement of knowledge through research.

3. We value interdisciplinary team care that is patient and family focused.

4. We value merits of differences.</description>
