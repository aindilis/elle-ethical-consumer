  <description>Donate money to the Draft Gore page on ActBlue, located at:

Money donated to this fund will go to Gore;s campaign if he announces. If he does not, then the money will revert to the DNC for use in the general election. Either way its money well spent and no risk. 

If you support Al Gore and want him to run for President, please chip in as little as $5. Money talks louder than blogging. Let's show Al that we will put our money where our mouth is!
