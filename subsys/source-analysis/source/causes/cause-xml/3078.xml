  <description>Colleges Against Cancer is a program designed to help eliminate cancer by initiating and supporting the programs of the American Cancer Society on college campuses. It is a program designed by and administered by college students from across the country and is supported by the American Cancer Society.

The program is designed to allow students and staff to work through many different channels to eliminate cancer. These channels are our strategic directions - advocacy, cancer education programs, Relay For Life, and survivorship. Local chapters work alongside their local offices and national leadership to support the efforts of the American Cancer Society in these directions. Whether it is writing letters to Congressmen, organizing a Relay For Life, or teaching students about preventing cancer - the program enables college students to battle cancer on their campuses.

The Relay For Life of University of Northern Iowa has raised approximately $300,000 in the past five years for the ACS.  

1. Cancer affects everyone's life in some way.

2. Through raising awareness and funds we can hopefully someday find a cure.</description>
