  <description>people around the city have been kicked off 
tennis courts and other areas for playing street hockey
i know its called "STREET" hockey
but a fenced off area were the balls dont go flying would be nice and a flat smooth area cause most of the streets suck to play on!
so we need to get our own place to play!
