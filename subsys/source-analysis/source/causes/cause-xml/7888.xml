  <description>I just want to help get the word out that all this
drinking and driving is getting bad, and all the 
families that are loosing loved ones everyday because some parent somewhere didn't tell their kids to call a cab, or call a friend or a family member no matter what time of night it is. I have lost a lot of people this way, and I, myself, have been hit by a drunk driver, so please help put that word out!

1. This is getting out of hand.
