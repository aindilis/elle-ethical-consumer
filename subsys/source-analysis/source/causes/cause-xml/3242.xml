  <description>In this cause i believe that pittbulls have feelings too just like cats and other dog breeds. People mistake them as cruel and misbehaved .Some people even believe they can snap for no reason. This is not true at all as long as you train them right ,and they dont get into the hands of crazy people they can be the sweetest dogs .Yes they can be for protection, but in the right enviroment they can and are one of the most loyal and loving animals.
