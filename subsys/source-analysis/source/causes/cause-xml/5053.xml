  <description>A loose alliance of drinkers dedicated to quenching everyone's thirst, especially their own, on the planet thru alcohol.

1. People who do not drink are not to be trusted.

2. Alcohol never destroys families. The family that drinks together, bonds together and stays together. If a family falls apart, it&#8217;s usually the fault of the non-drinker.

3. Alcohol makes life better, so stop reading this and take a drink.</description>
