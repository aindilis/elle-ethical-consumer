  <description>With the war in Iraq surpassing its fourth year, the U.S. critically divided on life-and-death issues like abortion rights, and the Israeli-Palestine conflict coming to a breaking point, one may begin to feel that humanity is lost or nonexistent in this low, dishonest age. There seems no better time to unite for a common cause to show that hope must be kept alive. The organizers of Whiskey For Zach are strongly committed to building bridges for peace internationally. Though the death toll is rising, the government has made it clear that it is unwilling to step in to resolve the crisis. It is urgent that relief be supplied to this strange sobriety-afflicted Jew. Whiskey For Zach assures you that, with your humble contributions, you can make a difference. Zach may pick up his guitar and play you a tune, tell you a humorous story, complain, hit on a girl, or even break something. Ask yourself: hasn't this tragedy endured long enough?

1. This weekday-long whiskey drought must end immediately.

2. Whiskey consumption is a universal right.

3. The purpose of Zach drinking whiskey is to black out and wake up in jail.
