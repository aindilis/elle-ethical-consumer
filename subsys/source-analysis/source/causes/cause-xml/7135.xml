  <description>Reba, a sitcom on the CW, was cancled this year after a short 6 season run. There was no good reason for the show to end... there was so much they still needed to happen..... This is a cause for people, who like me...miss the show... and would like to see new eppisodes back on the air!!

1. Reba needs a man...

2. that man should be Brock.

3. We need to see more of the adventures of Van Montgomery.</description>
