  <description>What Is It? Irritable Bowel Syndrome? Spastic Colon?
IBS, or Irritable Bowel Syndrome (also known as spastic colon, and sometimes improperly termed spastic colitis) is a devastating and incurable condition that afflicts up to 20% of the world's population. It is the most common chronic health disorder in America, Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, affecting more people than asthma, diabetes, and depression combined. Irritable Bowel Syndrome affects more than twice as many women as men, for reasons that are not yet understood. IBS is a physical &#8212; not psychological &#8212; disorder characterized by lower abdominal pain (spasms or cramps) or discomfort, diarrhea, constipation (or alternating diarrhea &amp; constipation), gas, bloating, and nausea. There is no cure for Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is actually a brain-gut dysfunction, but there are many very effective ways of controlling and even eliminating IBS symptoms through safe Irritable Bowel Syndrome treatments.
