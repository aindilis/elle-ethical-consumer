  <description>I just finished my first marathon for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society on June 3rd. I was able to raise over $4000 to go towards research for treatments and cures for blood-related cancers! I ran and raised money in honor of my grandfather, Tony Bartolotta, who has been battling leukemia for over 5 years now. 


It was such an amazing experience that I'm doing another one! I'm running the Nike Women's Marathon in October. I know most of you are poor college students and can't donate money, so I'm just asking for help with fundraisers--I need volunteers to help with carwashes, yard sales, and other simple little things this summer! So help out if you can, it'll be fun and it's for a great cause!!!


If you want to donate (which is super awesome, I never EVER expected college students to donate...thank you so much!!!)  PLEASEEEE click the link below so it goes toward my fundraising! (But anywhere you donate is awesome, thank you!)
