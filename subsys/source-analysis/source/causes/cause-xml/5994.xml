  <description>"Rostro de Cristo" meaning Face of Christ in Spanish educates individuals about the conditions in and around the cities of Guayaquil and Duran in Ecuador. Founded in 1988 by Fr. Jim Ronan of the Archdiocese of Boston, MA, Rostro de Cristo is a Volunteer &amp; Retreat Program of the Catholic Church. With its first house in central Dur&#225;n over 15 years ago, the Rostro de Cristo community is constantly moving to the areas of Dur&#225;n where the need is greatest. As the community has moved it has also grown, from its first year of only three in-country volunteers, to eleven volunteers in two communities and a growing community of nearly 100 alumni. Currently volunteers are living and working in the communities of Antonio Jose de Sucre &amp; Arbolito, and hosting 25 retreat groups year round from a diverse pool of colleges, universities, and high schools across the country.
