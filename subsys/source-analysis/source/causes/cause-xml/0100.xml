  <description>The National Roots &amp; Shoots Youth Leaders teamed with Animal Planet's R.O.A.R. Campaign and The National Arbor Day Foundation to create the ReBirth the Earth: Trees for Tomorrow Campaign. Roots &amp; Shoots groups in the U.S. are seeking tree sponsorships of $15 per tree for a total of 3,000 trees. They will learn about tree species native to their respective regions while partnering with local tree providers. Groups will then plant and care for the trees in their neighborhoods. The sponsorship money will go toward establishing the new tree nurseries for Roots &amp; Shoots Tanzania. Roots &amp; Shoots members and nonmembers are encouraged to participate in this campaign by collecting sponsorships and planting trees.

The Roots &amp; Shoots program is designed to engage and
inspire youth of all ages through service-learning projects. Founded by Dr. Jane Goodall in 1991, this fast-growing global program is based on the principle that knowledge leads to compassion, which inspires action. All Roots &amp; Shoots groups plan and implement service projects showing care and concern for the environment, animals and the human community. More info at www.rootsandshoots.org
