  <description>Rotaract is a non-profit, non-political international volunteer service organization for students and young professionals aged between 18 and 30 who want to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of Rotaract is to provide an opportunity for young men and women to enhance the knowledge and skills that will assist them in personal development, to address the physical and social needs of their communities, and to promote better relations between all people worldwide through a framework of friendship and service.&lt;br /&gt;
Rotaract is a younger member of the Rotary family, and clubs exist all over the world. The dynamic young members of Rotaract, called "Rotaractors", have big dreams and a whole heap of enthusiasm to help leave this world we share a better place than we found it!&lt;br /&gt;
Let's spread the word about this awesome organization that helps build ethical leaders while promoting worldwide friendships!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I've chosen The Rotary Foundation as the charity to donate to, to support our larger family. Supporting the Rotary Foundation also benefits Rotaract though the ability to undertake Matching Grants with Rotary clubs to fund our big project ideas, and many Rotaractors are able to apply for Ambassadorial Scholarships and Group Study Exchanges thanks to the Foundation.&lt;/em&gt;
