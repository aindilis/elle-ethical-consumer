  <description>Educate Rabbit Owners About the Importance of Veterinary Care for their Bunny!

When you buy your rabbit at a pet shop like I did they FAIL to explain that rabbits like dogs and cats need regular vet check ups. Even though rabbits do not need annual vaccines it is crucial that you take your rabbit to the vet at least once a year! Rabbits are prey in the wild and they are very good at hiding signs that they are ill until it is too late. The smallest abnormal behavior that you notice in your rabbit (eg doesn't eat at regular meal time or not grooming certain areas) can be a sign that your rabbit is seriously ill. Rabbits have very sensitive digestive tracts and teeth. Once a week you should brush your rabbit it is a great way for you and bun to bond and it helps you detect any early signs of illness and prevents fur balls (rabbits CAN NOT Throw up fur balls like cats) . Every other week you should check your rabbits teeth as they grow constantly and may need to be shaved down by your vet if they are causing your rabbit discomfort.
