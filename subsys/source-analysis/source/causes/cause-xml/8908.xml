  <description> THE WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS MUCH LIKE THE VIETNAM WAR ITS UNPOPULAR. MANY OF THE SOLDIERS DON'T GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED FROM THE AMERICAN CITIZENS. I READ A QUOTE LAST WEEK AND IT SAID "NO ON CARES ABOUT A SOLDIER TILL THE ENEMY'S AT THE GATE". ANYWAYS IF YOU KNOW SOME ONE IN THE MILITARY (ARMY,NAVY,COAST GUARD,AIR FORCE,MARINES)
AND YOU SUPPORT THEM THEN SIGN UP FOR THIS GROUP! 


1. HONOR 

2. LOYALTY 

3. RESPECT </description>
