Example 2: Using SPARQL for filtering

This example demonstrates how to keep the annotations constrained to only politicians related to Chicago.

    text= “President Obama called Wednesday on Congress to extend a tax break for students included in last year's economic stimulus package, arguing that the policy provides more generous assistance.”
    confidence = 0.2; support=20
    whitelist sparql = SELECT DISTINCT ?politician WHERE { ?politician a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/OfficeHolder> . ?politician ?related <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago> }
