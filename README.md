Please note, not all the data included is licensed GPLv3.  A lot of

Notes ----- This is the latest version of this.  Much of the
associated data may have been lost in a hard drive failure around
2012.  That would be the contents of the ./data dir. 

This software depends on unreleased software from the FRDCSA project.
Please assist me in preparing that software for release.
