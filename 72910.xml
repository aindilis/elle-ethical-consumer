  <description>Camfed fights poverty and HIV/AIDS in rural Africa by educating girls and empowering young women to become leaders of change.

Since 1993, Camfed has improved educational opportunities for 645,400 children in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Malawi and Tanzania.
 
With an education, a girl in Africa:
 
&#8226; Is 3 times less likely to contract HIV/AIDS
&#8226; Has a smaller, healthier family
&#8226; Earns 25% more income &amp; reinvests 90% back into her family

There's no better way to change the future of girls in rural Africa than by providing them with an education.
 


1. Girls and young women in rural areas of Africa are the most disadvantaged social group in the world today.

2. Without an education, girls are likely to be trapped in a cycle of poverty. 

3. By sending girls to school, Camfed sets them on the path to self-reliance so they can improve their own lives, their families and communities. </description>
