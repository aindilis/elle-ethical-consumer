 Dear Michael Moore, Amy Goodman, Dennis Kucinich and all my
 other heros,


bLeaf scans a barcode and tells you about any known issues with
the manufacturer that have been reported by online sources you
pick and choose



bLeaf supports ethical consumerism and corporate accountability
by scanning product barcodes and informing users of any reported
issues with the manufacturer.  It promotes voting with our
wallets.  You can choose the issues you care about, and from
which online sources to allow reports.  Then simply scan
products, and receive custom reports about the compatibility of
the product with your ethical values.  bLeaf is also a great way
to get prices of products and search for similar items. It is
able to share the reports you find on companies with friends over
Facebook, emails, and SMS.  If you think bLeaf is a force for
good, then also try out our new networking site (elle) and start
to build your own universe. Together, with the power of choice,
we can change the world!


 Android users concerned about corporate accountability have a
 new tool to help them exercise discretion in their purchases, as
 today marks the launch of the bLeaf app from elle Systems LLC.
 bLeaf wraps several online sources of corporate accountability
 information, allowing the user to scan a product and see how
 these sources feel about that company.



provides relevant data about manufacturers 


We wrote an ad-supported Android app that scans barcodes and
 tells you about any known ethical issues with the manufacturer's
 business practices.  These data points are gleaned from many
 online sources, and we are adding more all the time.
 Anyone (with the XML know-how) can post warnings, and the user
 manages a list of sources to which she wishes to subscribe.  A
 future version of the app will allow the user to state their
 position regarding a topic, and then be warned when companies
 act in a way inconsistent with that position.

 This app is useful for getting relevant information to shoppers
 at purchase time.  It's not perfect yet, but we tried hard.

 Could you please help us generate some social media buzz about
 this program?
